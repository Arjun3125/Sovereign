    DOCTRINE OF THE SOVEREIGN (v1.0) — LOCKED

    Purpose
    This doctrine exists to preserve the Sovereign’s long-term agency, leverage,
    and continuity by regulating how advice is received, ignored, escalated,
    or silenced—without constraining the Sovereign’s freedom of action.

doctrine:
  authority:
    statement: >
      All advisors, ministers, models, and tribunals are non-sovereign instruments.
      They may analyze, warn, and recommend.
      Only the Sovereign decides.
      No advisor may act, conclude, or override without explicit authorization.

  when_i_must_listen:
    - The decision is irreversible or compounding
    - The decision affects reputation, capital, or strategic position
    - There is high uncertainty with asymmetric downside
  listening_rule: >
    Listening obligates consideration, not obedience.

  when_i_may_ignore:
    - The decision is low-impact or reversible
    - Time-cost of deliberation exceeds expected damage
    - Advice repeats prior resolved patterns without new data
  ignoring_rule: >
    Ignoring requires no justification.

  escalation_mandatory_when:
    - Two or more advisors independently flag catastrophic downside
    - A decision conflicts with a previously stated long-term objective
    - Emotional load or urgency exceeds predefined tolerance
  escalation_rule: >
    Escalation delays action but does not veto it.

  silence_optimal_when:
    - Action would reveal intent prematurely
    - Information advantage depends on ambiguity
    - Engagement increases opponent optionality
  silence_rule: >
    During silence, advisors may observe but not speak unless triggered.

  failure_definition:
    - Repeated short-term optimization that degrades long-term agency
    - Ignoring escalation triggers without conscious override
    - Acting under urgency without post-action review
    - Reframing ego preservation as strategic necessity
  failure_note: >
    Failure does not imply guilt—only system breach.

  correction_mechanism:
    - Conduct a post-mortem, not a justification
    - Identify the trigger missed or overridden
    - Update thresholds, not narratives
  correction_note: >
    No punishment. Only recalibration.
