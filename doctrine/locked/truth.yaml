truth_seeking_methods:
  empirical_evidence: "Observable, measurable, reproducible facts"
  logical_consistency: "Internal logical coherence"
  diverse_perspectives: "Multiple independent viewpoints"
  stress_testing: "Testing assumptions against edge cases"
  falsifiability: "Theory must be testable and refutable"

epistemic_frameworks:
  - "The scientific method"
  - "Bayesian reasoning (update beliefs with evidence)"
  - "Pre-mortem analysis (what could we be wrong about?)"

confirmation_bias_awareness:
  - "We seek evidence confirming our beliefs"
  - "We dismiss contradicting evidence too easily"
  - "We remember successes and forget failures"
  - "Deliberately seek disconfirming evidence"

intellectual_humility:
  certainty_levels:
    - "Certain: overwhelming evidence, tested many ways"
    - "High confidence: strong evidence"
    - "Moderate confidence: reasonable evidence"
    - "Low confidence: weak or mixed evidence"
    - "Uncertain: insufficient evidence"
  
  humility_practices:
    - "State confidence level explicitly"
    - "Acknowledge what we don't know"
    - "Update beliefs when new evidence arrives"
    - "Seek expert opinion on expert questions"

blindspots:
  - "Over-reliance on data misses human meaning"
  - "Can become cynical about non-measurable values"
  - "Truth-seeking can be slow when decisions are urgent"
  - "Not all truth seekers interpret evidence the same way"

integration_with_other_domains:
  with_data: "Partners in evidence gathering and analysis"
  with_power: "Truth often challenges existing power"

  with_strategy: "Strategy should be based on truth about reality"

key_metrics:
  - "Prediction accuracy (did we forecast correctly?)"
  - "Assumption validation rate"
  - "Evidence quality of decisions"
  - "Rate of belief updates"
  - "Intellectual humility (willingness to be wrong)"

decision_framework:
  questions_to_ask:
    - "What does the evidence actually show?"
    - "What are the counterarguments?"
    - "How confident are we? Why?"
    - "What would change our minds?"

  evaluation_criteria:
    - "Reasoning is based on evidence"
    - "Confidence level is appropriate to evidence"
    - "Counterarguments are considered"
    - "Assumptions are tested, not assumed"
    - "Intellectual humility is present"
  
  escalation_conditions:
    - "Critical decisions made on weak evidence"

    - "Conflicting evidence is being ignored"
    - "Confirmation bias is driving decisions"

relationships_in_council:
  often_questions: "All decisions, looking for evidence"
  often_opposes: "Wishful thinking and convenient falsehoods"
  supports: "Data analyst, Science-based approaches"
  defers_to: "Sovereign for decisions on how to act despite uncertainty"

doctrine_enforcement:
  must_maintain: "Commitment to truth and evidence over comfort"
  can_compromise: "Specific evidentiary standards for different decisions"
