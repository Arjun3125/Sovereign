ACKNOW LEDGMENTS 
First I would like to thank Anna Biller, who helped edit and research this book, and whose in­
valuable insights played a critical role in the shape and content of The 48 Laws. Without her, 
none of this would have been possible. 
I must also thank my dear friend Michiel Schwarz who was responsible for involving me in 
the art school Fabrika in Italy and introducing me there to Joost Elffers, my partner and producer 
of The 48 Laws ofPower.1t was in the scheming world ofFabrika thatJoost and I saw the timeless­
ness of Machiavelli and from our discussions in Venice, Italy, this book was born. 
I would like to thank Renri Le Goubin, who supplied me with many Machiavellian anec­
dotes over the years, particularly conceming the numerous French characters who play such a 
large role in this book. 
I would also like to thank Les and Sumiko Biller, who lent me their library on Japanese his­
tory and helped me with the Japanese Tea Ceremony part of the book. Similarly, I must thank 
my good friend Elizabeth Yang who advised me on Chinese history. 
A book like this depended greatly on the research material available and I am particularly 
gratenIl to the UCLA Research Library; I spent many pleasant days wandering through its in­
comparable collections. 
My parents, Laurette and Stanley Green, des erve endless thanks for their patience and 
support. 
And I must not forget to pay tribute to my cat, Boris, who kept me company throughout the 
never-ending days of writing. 
Finally, to those people in my life who have so skillfully used the game of power to manipu­
late, torture, and cause me pain over the years, I bear you no grudges and I thank you for sup­
plying me with inspiration for The 48 Laws ofPower.

LAW 1 page 1 
NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER 
Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please or impress them, do not go 
too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opposite-inspire fear and insecurity. Make 
your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power. 
LAW 2 page 8 
NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS, 
LEARN HOW TO USE ENEMIES 
Be wary of fiiends-they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become 
spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more 
to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from fiiends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to 
make them. 
LAW 3 page 16 
CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS 
Keep people off-balance and in the dark lly never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no 
clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrang path, envelop 
them in enough smoke, and lly the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late. 
LAW 4 page 31 
ALWAYS SAY LESS THAN NECESSARY 
When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less 
in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, 
and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate lly saying less. The more you say, the more likely you 
are to say something foolish. 
LAW 5 page 37 
SO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION-GU ARD IT WITH YOUR LIFE 
Reputation is the corners tone of power. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win; once it slips, 
however, you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be 
alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, leam to destroy your enem ies lly 
opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and Let public opinion hang them. 
LAW 6 page44 
COURT ATTENTION AT ALL COST 
Everything is judged lly its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing. Never Let yourself get lost in the 
crowd, then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost. Make yourself a magnet of attention 
lrj appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious than the bland and timid masses. 
CONTENTS ix 
LAW 7 page 56 
GET OTHERS TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU, BUT ALWAYS TAKE THE CREDIT 
Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to furtker your own cause. Not only will such assis­
tance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end 
your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you. 
LAW S page 62 
MAKE OTHER PEOPLE COME TO YOU-USE BAIT IF NECESSARY 
When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent 
come to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains-then attack. You hold 
the cards. 
LAW<) page69 
WIN THROUGH YOUR AC TIONS, NEVER THROUGH ARGUMENT 
Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resent­
ment and ill will you stir up is stronger and !asts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much 
more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do 
not explicate. 
LAW 10 page 76 
INFECTION: AVOID THE UNHAPPY AND UNLUCKY 
You can die from someone eises misery-emotional states are as infectious as diseases. You may feel you are 
helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw 
misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead. 
LA W 1 1 page 82 
LEARN TO KEEP PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON YOU 
To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more 
freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear. 
Never teach them enough so that they can do without you. 
LA W I 2 page 89 
USE SELECTIVE HONESTY AND GENEROSITY TO DISARM YOUR VICTIM 
One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. open-hearted gestures of honesty and 
generosity bring down the guard of even the most suspicious people. Once your selective honesty opens a hole in 
their armor, you can deceive and manipulate them at will. A timely gift-a Trojan horse-will serve the same 
pur pose. 
LA W 1.1 page 95 
WHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEA L TO PEOPLE'S SELF-INTERE ST, 
NEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE 
If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your past assistance and good deeds. He 
will find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that 
will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will res pond enthusiastically when he sees some­
thing to be gained for himself. 
x CONTENT S 
LA W 14 page 101 
POSE AS A FRIEND , WORK AS A SPY 
Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead. 
Better still: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, leam to probe. Ask indireet questions to get people 
to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artjul spying. 
LAW 15 page 107 
CRUSH YOUR ENEMY TOTALLY 
All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they 
have leamed this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventu­
ally break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover, 
and will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit. 
LAW 16 page 115 
USE ABSENCE TO INCREASE RESPECT AND HONOR 
Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you 
appear. If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked 
about, even more admired. You must leam when to leave. Create value through scarcity. 
LA W 17 page 123 
KEEP OTHERS IN SUSPENDED TERROR: CULTIVATE AN AIR OF UNPRE DlCTABI LlTY 
Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other people's aetions. Your pre­
dietability gives them a sense of control. Tum the tables: Be deliberately unpredietable. Behavior that seems to 
have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain 
your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize. 
LA W 1 i:l page 130 
DO NOT BUILD FORTRESSES TO PROTECT YOURSELF-ISOLATION IS DANGEROUS 
The world is dangerous and enemies are everywkere-everyone has to proteet themselves. A fortress seems the 
safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you from-it cuts you off from valuable in­
formation, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people, find allies, mingle. 
You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd. 
LAW 19 page 137 
KNOW WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH-DO NOT OFFEND THE WRONG PERSON 
There are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to 
your strategies in the same way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives 
seeking revenge. They are wolves in lambs' clothing. Choose your vietims and opponents carefully, then­
never offend or deceive the wrang person. 
CONTENTS Xl 
LAW 20 page 145 
DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE 
It is the Jool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself. By maintaining 
your independence, you become the master oJ others-playing people against one another, making them pursue 
you. 
LAW 21 page156 
PLAY A SUCKER TO CATCH A SUCKER-SEEM DUMBER THAN YOUR MARK 
No one likes Jeeling stupider than the next person. The trick, then, is to make your victims Jeel smart-and not 
Just smart, but smarter than you are. Once convinced oJ this, they will never suspect that you may have ulttr 
rior motives. 
LAW 22 page 163 
USE THE SURRENDER TACTIC: TRANSFORM WEAKNESS INTO POWER 
When you are weaker, never fight Jor honor's sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to re­
cover, time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait Jor his power to wane. Do not give him the sat­
isJaction oJ fighting and deJeating you-surrender first. By turning the other cheek you inJuriate and unsettle 
him. Make surrender a tool oJ power. 
LAW 23 page 171 
CONCENTRATE YOUR FORCES 
Conserve your Jorces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point. You gain more by find­
ing a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flittingjrom one shallow mine to another-intensity deJeats ex­
tensity every time. When looking Jor sources oJ power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the Jat cow who 
will give you milk Jor a long time to come. 
LAW 24 page 178 
PLAY THE PERFECT COURTIER 
The perJect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity. He has 
mastered the art oJ indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the most oblique 
and graceJul manner. Learn and apply the laws oJ courtiership and there will be no limit to how Jar you can 
rise in the court. 
LAW 25 page 191 
RE-CREATE YOUR S.ELF 
Do not accept the roles that society Joists on you. Re-create yourself by Jorging a new identity, one that com­
mands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master oJ your own image rather than letting others dtr 
fine it Jor you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions-your power will be 
enhanced and your character will seem larger than life. 
LA W 26 page 200 
KEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN 
You must seem a paragon oJ civility and efficiency: Your hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds. 
Maintain such a spotless appearance by using otkers as scapegoats and cat 's-paws to disguise your in­
volvement. 
xii CONTENT S 
LAW 27 page 215 
PLAY ON PEOP LE'S NEED TO BEL IEVE TO CREATE A CUL TLIKE FOLL OWING 
People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become the focal point of such desire by offering 
them a cause, a new faith to follow. Keep your words vague but full of promise; emphasize enthusiasm over 
rationality and clear thinking. Give your new disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifi,ces on your 
behalf. In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold 
power. 
LAW 28 page227 
ENTER ACTION WITH BO LDNESS 
If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execu­
tion. Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit thrvugh audacity are eas­
ily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid. 
LAW 29 page 236 
PLAN AL L THE WAY TO THE END 
The ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles, 
and twists offortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By planning to the end 
you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help 
determine the future by thinkingfar ahead. 
LAW 30 page 245 
MAKE YOUR ACCOMP LIS HMENTS SEEM EFFORT LESS 
Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also 
all the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. Avoid the 
temptation of revealing how hard you work-it only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be 
used against you. 
LAW 31 page254 
CONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH THE CARDS YOU DEAL 
The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in contral, 
but are actually your puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose. Forr;e 
them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which seroe your purpose. Put them on the horns of 
a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn. 
LAW 32 page263 
PLAY TO PEOP LE'S FANTASIES 
The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to tru,th and reality unless you are 
prepared for the anger that comes frvm disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can 
manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great 
power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses. 
CONTENT S xiii 
LAW 33 page271 
DISCOVER EACH MAN'S THUMBSCREW 
Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable 
emotion or need; it can also be a small secret pleasure. Either way, once Jound, it is a thumbscrew you can turn 
to your advantage. 
LA W :H page 282 
BE ROYAL IN YOUR OWN FASHION: ACT LIKE A KING TO BE TREATED LIKE ONE 
The way you carry yourself will oßen determine how you are treated: In the long TUn, appearing vulgar or com­
mon will make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By 
acting regally and confident oJ your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown. 
LAW ,,5 page291 
MASTER THE ART OF TIMING 
Never seem to be in a hurry-hurrying betrays a lack oJ control over yourself, and over time. Always seem pa­
tient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective oJ the right moment; sniff 
out the spirit oJ the times, the trends that will carry you to power. Leam to stand back when the time is not yet 
ripe, and to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition. 
LAW :16 page 300 
DISDAIN THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE: IGNORING THEM IS THE BEST REVENGE 
By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, 
the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is oßen made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It 
is sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt Jor it. 
The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem. 
LAW �7 page309 
CREATE COMPELLING SPECTACLES 
Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura oJ power-everyone responds to them. Stage spec­
tacles Jor those around you, then, Jull oJ arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence. 
Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing. 
LAW �g page 317 
THINK AS YOU LIKE BUT BEHAVE LIKE OTHERS 
If you make a show oJ going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, 
people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to 
punish you Jor making them Jeel inJerior. It is Jar saJer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your 
originality only with tolerant Jriends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness. 
LA W :39 page 325 
STIR UP WATERS TO CATCH FISH 
Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But if you 
can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies 
off-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings.

DESPISE THE FREE LUNCH 
'What is offered Jor Jree is dangerous-it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. 'What has worth 
is worth paying Jor. By paying your own way you stay clear oJ gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also often wise 
to pay the Jull price--there is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it circu­
lating, Jor generosity is a sign and a magnet Jor power. 
LAW 41 page 347 
AVOID STEPPING INTO A GREAT MAN'S SHOES 
'What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after. If you succeed a great man 
or have a Jamous parent, you will have to accomplish double their achiev ements to outshine them. Do not get 
lost in their shadow, or stuck in a past not oJ your own making: Establish your own name and identity lry 
changing course. Slay the overbearing Jather, disparage his legacy, and gain power lry shining in your own 
way. 
LA W 42 page 358 
STRIKE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP WILL SCATTER 
Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual-the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoner oJ 
goodwill. If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their injluence. Do not wait Jor the 
troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them-they are irredeemable. Neutralize their in­
fluence lry isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source oJ the trouble and the sheep will scatter.

WORK ON THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OTHERS 
Coercion creates areaction that will eventually work against you. You must seduce others into wanting to 
move in your direction. A person you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to seduce others is to 
operate on their individual psychologies and weaknesses. Soften up the resistant lry working on their emotions, 
playing on what they hold dear and what they Jear. Ignore the hearts and minds oJ others and they will grow to 
hateyou.

DISARM AND INFURIATE WITH THE MIRROR EFFECT 
The mirror rejlects reality, but it is also the perJect tool Jor deception: 'When you mirror your enemies, doing ex­
actly as they do, they cannot figure out your strategy. The Mirror Effect mocks and humiliates them, making 
them overreact. By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce tltem with the illusion that you share their 
values; lry holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a lesson. Few can resist the power oJ the Mirror 
Effect.

PREACH THE NEED FOR CHANGE, BUT NEVER REFORM TOO MUCH AT ONCE 
Everyone understands the need Jor change in the abstract, but on the day-to-day level people are creatures oJ 
habit. Too much innovation is traumatic, and will lead to revolt. If you are new to a position oJ power, or an 
outsider trying to build a power base, make a show oJ respecting the old way oJ doing things. If change is nec­
essary, make it Jeellike a gentle improvement on the past.

NEVER APPE AR TOO PERFECT 
Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of alt is to appear to have no faults or 
weaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. It is smart to oeeasionalty display defeets, and admit to harmless 
viees, in order to defleet envy and appear more human and approaehable. Only gods and the dead can seem 
perfeet with impunity.

DO NOT GO PAST THE MARK YOU AIMED FOR; 
IN VICTORY, LEARN WH EN TO STOP 
The moment of vietory is often the moment of greatest peril. In the heat of vietory, arroganee and overeonfi­
denee ean push you past the goal you had aimed for, and by going too far, you make more enemies than you 
defeat. Do not allow sueeess to go to your head. There is no substitute for strategy and eareful planning. Set a 
goal, and when you reaeh it, stop. 
LA W 48 page 419 
ASSUME FORMLESSNESS 
By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attaek. Instead of taking a form for your 
enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move. Aeeept the faet that nothing is eertain and no law is 
fixed. The best way to proteet yourself is to be as fluid and formless as water; never bet on stability or lasting 
order. Everything ehanges.

PRE FA C E 
The feeling of having no power over people and events is generally un­
bearable to us-- when we feel helpless we feel miserable. No one wants less 
power; everyone wants more. In the world today, however, it is dangerous 
to seem too power hungry, to be overt with your power moves. We have 
to seem fair and decent. So we need to be subtle-congenial yet cunning, 
demo cratic yet devious. 
This game of constant duplicity most resembles the power dynamic 
that existed in the scheming world of the old aristocratic court. Throughout 
history, a court has always formed itself around the person in power-king, 
queen, emperor, leader. The courtiers who filled this court were in an espe­
cially delicate position: They had to serve their masters, but if they seemed 
to fawn, if they curried favor too obviously, the other courtiers around 
them would notice and would act against them. Attempts to win the mas­
ter's favor, then, had to be subtle. And even skilIed courtiers capable of 
such subtlety still had to protect themselves from their fellow courtiers, 
who at all moments were scheming to push them aside. 
Meanwhile the court was supposed to represent the height of civiliza­
tion and refinement. Violent or overt power moves were frowned upon; 
courtiers would work silently and secretly against any among them who 
used force. This was the courtier's dilemma: Wh ile appearing the very 
paragon of elegance, they had to outwit and thwart their own opponents in 
the subdest of ways. The successful courtier learned over time to make all 
of his moves indirect; if he stabbed an opponent in the back, it was with a 
velvet glove on his hand and the sweetest of srniles on his face. Instead of 
using coercion or outright treachery, the perfect courtier got his way 
through seduction, charm, deception, and subtle strategy, always planning 
several moves ahead. Life in the court was a never-ending game that re­
quired constant vigilance and tactical thinking. It was civilized war. 
Today we face a peculiarly similar paradox to that of the courtier: 
Everything must appear civilized, decent, democratic, and fair. But if we 
play by those rules too strictly, if we take them too literally, we are crushed 
by those around us who are not so foolish. As the great Renaissance diplo­
mat and courtier Niccolö Machiavelli wrote, ''Any man who tries to be 
good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who 
are not good." The court imagined itself the pinnacle of refinement, but un-

xviii PREFACE derneath its glittering surface a cauldron of dark emotion s---greed, envy, 
lust, hatred-boiled and simmered. Our world today similarly imagines it­
self the pinnacle of fairness, yet the same ugly emotions still stir within us, 
as they have forever. The game is the same. Outwardly, you must seem to 
respect the niceties, but inwardly, unless you are a fool, you learn quickly 
to be prudent, and to do as Napoleon advised: Place your iron hand inside 
a velvet glove. If, like the courtier of times gone by, you can master the arts 
of indirection, leaming to seduce, charm, deceive, and subtly outmaneuver 
your opponents, you will attain the heights of power. You will be able to 
make people bend to your will without their realizing what you have done. 
And if they do not realize what you have done, they will neither resent nor 
resist you. 
To some people the notion of consciously playing power game s---no mat­
ter how indirect-seems evil, asocial, a relic of the past. They believe they 
can opt out of the game by behaving in ways that have nothing to do with 
power. You must beware of such people, for while they express such opin­
ions outwardly, they are often among the most adept players at power . 
They utilize strategies that cleverly disguise the nature of the manipulation 
involved. These types, for example, will often display their weakness and 
lack of power as a kind of moral virtue. But true powerlessness, without 
any motive of self-interest, would not publicize its weakness to gain sympa­
thy or respect. Making a show of one's weakness is actually a very effective 
strategy, subtle and deceptive, in the game of power (see Law 22, the Sur­
render Tactic). 
Another strategy of the supposed nonplayer is to demand equality in 
every area oflife. Everyone must be treated alike, whatever their status and 
strength. But if, to avoid the taint of power, you attempt to treat everyone 
equally and fairly, you will confront the problem that some people do cer­
tain things better than others. Treating everyone equally means ignoring 
their differences, elevating the less skillful and suppressing those who 
excel. Again, many of those who behave this way are actually deploying 
another power strategy, redistributing people's rewards in a way that they 
determine. 
Yet another way of avoiding the game would be perfect honesty and 
straightforwardness, since one of the main techniques of those who seek 
power is deceit and secrecy. But being perfectly honest will inevitably hurt 
and insult a great many people, some of whom will choose to injure you in 
return. No one will see your honest statement as completely objective and 
free of some personal motivation. And they will be right: In truth, the use 
ofhonesty is indeed apower strategy, intended to convince people of one's 
noble, good-hearted, selfless character. It is a form of persuasion, even a 
subtle form of coercion. 
Finally, those who claim to be nonplayers may affect an air of na'ivete, 
to protect them from the accusation that they are after power . Beware 
again, however, for the appearance of naivete can be an effective means of 
deceit (see Law 21, Seem Dumber Than YOUf Mark). And even genuine 
naivete is not free of the snares of power . Children may be naive in many 
ways, but they often act from an elemental need to gain control over those 
around them. Children suffer greatly from feeling powerless in the adult 
world, and they use any means available to get their way. Genuinely inno­
cent people may still be playing for power, and are often horribly effective 
at the game, since they are not hindered by reflection. Once again, those 
who make a show or display of innocence are the least innocent of al!. The only means to gain 
one:,' ends with people 
are force and cunning

JOHANN VON GOETlII', 
1749-1S32 You can recognize these supposed nonplayers by the way they flaunt 
their moral qualities, their piety, their exquisite sense of justice. But since 
all ofus hunger for power, and almost all of our actions are aimed at gain­
ing it, the nonplayers are merely throwing dust in OUf eyes, distracting us 
from their power plays with their air of moral superiority. If you observe 
them closely, you will see in fact that they are often the ones most skillful at 
indirect manipulation, even if some of them practice it unconsciously. And 
they greatly resent any publicizing of the tactics they use every day. 
If the world is like a giant scheming court and we are trapped inside it, 
there is no use in trying to opt out of the game. That will only render you 
powerless, and powerlessness will make you miserable. Instead of strug­
gling against the inevitable, instead of arguing and whining and feeling 
guilty, it is far better to excel at power. In fact, the better you are at dealing 
with power, the better friend, lover, husband, wife, and person you be­
come. By following the route of the perfect courtier (see Law 24) you learn 
to make others feel better about themselves, becoming a SOUfce of pleasure 
to them. They will grow dependent on YOUf abilities and desirous of YOUf 
presence. By mastering the 48 laws in this book, you spare others the pain 
that comes from bungling with power-by playing with fire without know­
ing its properties. If the game of power is inescapable, better to be an artist 
than a denier or a bungler. The arrow shot by the 
archer fllay or fnay not

slralagems devised hy a 
wise man can kill even

Learning the game of power requires a certain way of looking at the world, 
a shifting of perspective. It takes effort and years of practice, for much of 
the game may not come naturally. Certain basic skills are required, and 
once you master these skills you will be able to apply the laws of power 
more easily. 
The most important of these skills, and power's crucial foundation, is ] 
the ability to master your emotions. An emotional response to a situation is 
the single greatest barrier to power, amistake that will cost you a lot more 
than any temporary satisfaction you might gain by expressing YOUf feel­
ings. Emotions cloud reason, and if you cannot see the situation clearly, 
you cannot prepare for and respond to it with any degree of contro!. 
Anger is the most destructive of emotional responses, for it clouds 
your vision the most. It also has a ripple effect that invariably makes situa­
tions less controllable and heightens your enemy's resolve. If you are try­
ing to destroy an enemy who has hurt you, far better to keep hirn off-guard 
by feigning friendliness than showing your anger. KAUTILYA,

xx PREFACE Love and affection are also potentially destructive, in that they blind 
you to the often self-serving interests of those whom you least suspect of 
playing a power game. You cannot repress anger or love, or avoid feeling 
them, and you should not try. But you should be careful about how you ex­
press them, and most important, they should never influence your plans 
and strategies in any way. 
Related to mastering YOUf emotions is the ability to distance YOUfseif 
from the present moment and think objectively about the past and future. 
Like Janus, the double-faeed Roman deity and guardian of all gates and 
doorways, you must be able to look in both direetions at onee, the better to 
handle danger from wherever it comes. Such is the face you must create for 
YOUfself-one face looking continuously to the future and the other to the 
past. 
For the future, the motto is, "No days unalert." No thing should catch 
you by surprise because you are constantly imagining problems before 
they arise. Instead of spending your time dreaming of YOUf plan's happy 
ending, you must work on calculating every possible permutation and pit­
fall that might emerge in it. The further you see, the more steps ahead you 
plan, the more powerful you become. 
The other face of Janus looks constantly to the past-though not to re­
member past hUftS or bear grudges. That would only curb YOUf power . 
Half of the game is learn ing how to forget those events in the past that eat 
away at you and doud YOUf reason. The real purpose of the backward­
glancing eye is to educate YOUfseif eonstantly-you look at the past to learn 
from those who came before you. (The many historical examples in this 
book will greatly help that process.) Then, having looked to the past, you 
look doser at hand, to YOUf own aetions and those of YOUf friends. This is 
the most vital school you ean learn from, because it comes from personal 
experience. 
You begin by examining the mistakes you have made in the past, the 
ones that have most grievously held you back. You analyze them in terms 
of the 48 laws of power, and you extraet from them a lesson and an oath: 
"I shall never repeat such amistake; I shall never fall into such a trap 
again." If you can evaluate and observe yourself in this way, you can learn 
to break the patterns of the past-an immensely valuable skill. 
Power requires the ability to play with appearanees. To this end you 
must learn to wear many masks and keep a bag full of deceptive tricks. De­
ception and masquerade should not be seen as ugly or immoral. All human 
interaction requires deception on many levels, and in some ways what sep­
arates humans from animals is our ability to lie and deceive. In Greek 
myths, in India's Mahabharata cyde, in the Middle Eastern epic of Gilga­
mesh, it is the privilege of the gods to use deceptive arts; a great man, 
Odysseus for instance, was judged by his ability to riyal the craftiness of the 
gods, stealing some of their divine power by matching them in wits and de­
ception. Deeeption is a developed art of civilization and the most potent 
weapon in the game of power. 
You cannot succeed at deception unless you take a somewhat dis­
tanced approach to yourself-unless you can be many different people, 
wearing the mask that the day and the moment require. With such a flexi­
ble approach to all appearances, induding your own, you lose a lot of the 
inward heaviness that holds people down. Make your face as malleable as 
the actor's, work to conceal your intentions from others, practice luring 
people into traps. Playing with appearances and mastering arts of decep­
tion are among the aesthetic pleasures of life. They are also key compo­
nents in the acquisition of power. 
If deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then patience 
in all things is your crucial shield. Patience will protect you from making 
moronic blunders. Like mastering your emotions, patience is a skill-it 
does not come naturall y. But nothing about power is natural; power is 
more godlike than anything in the natural world. And patience is the 
supreme virtue of the gods, who have nothing but time. Everything good 
will happen-the grass will grow again, if you give it time and see several 
steps into the future. Impatience, on the other hand, only makes you look 
weak. It is a principal impediment to power . 
Power is essentially amoral and one of the most imp ortant skills to ac­
quire is the ability to see circumstances rather than good or evil. Power is a 
game-this cannot be repeated too often-and in games you do not judge 
your opponents by their intentions but by the effect of their actions. You 
measure their strategy and their power by what you can see and feel. How 
often are someone's intentions made the issue only to doud and deceive! 
What does it matter if another player, your friend or riyal, intended good 
things and had only your interests at heart, if the effects of his action lead to 
so much ruin and confusion? It is only natural for people to cover up their 
actions with all kinds of justifications, always assuming that they have acted 
out of goodness. You must learn to inwardly laugh each time you hear this 
and never get caught up in gauging someone's intentions and actions 
through a set of moral judgments that are really an excuse far the accumu­
lation of power. 
It is agame. Your opponent sits opposite you. Both of you behave as 
gentl emen or ladies, observing the rules of the game and taking nothing 
pers onally. You play with a strategy and you observe your opponent's 
moves with as much calmness as you can muster. In the end, you will ap­
preciate the politeness of those you are playing with more than their good 
and sweet intentions. Train your eye to follow the results of their moves, 
the outward circumstances, and do not be distracted by anything else. 
Half of your mastery of power comes from what you do not do, what 
you do not allow yourself to get dragged into. For this skill you must learn 
to judge all things by what they cost you. As Nietzsche wrote, "The value of 
a thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it, but in what one pays 
for it-what it costsus." Perhaps you will attain your goal, and a worthy goal 
at that, but at what price? Apply this standard to everything, induding 
whether to collaborate with other people or come to their aid. In the end, 
PREFACE xxi 
xxii PREFACE life is short, opportunities are few, and you have only so much energy to 
draw on. And in this sense time is as important a consideration as any 
other. Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of 
others-that is too high a price to pay. 
Power is a social game. To leam and master it, you must develop the 
ability to study and understand people. As the great seventeenth-century 
thinker and courtier Baltasar Graciän wrote: "Many people spend time 
studying the properties of animals or herbs; how much more important it 
would be to study those of people, with whom we must live or die!" To be a 
master player you must also be a master psychologist. You must recognize 
motivations and see through the cloud of dust with which people surround 
their actions. An understanding of people's hidden motives is the single 
greatest piece of knowledge you can have in acquiring power. It opens up 
endless possibilities of deception, seduction, and manipulation. 
People are of infinite complexity and you can spend a lifetime watch­
ing them without ever fully understanding them. So it is all the more im­
portant, then, to begin your education now. In doing so you must also keep ( one principle in mind: Never discriminate as to whom you study and 
i whom you trust. Never trust anyone completely and study everyone, in­
cluding friends and loved ones. 
Finally, you must leam always to take the indirect route to power. Dis­
guise your cunning. Like a billiard ball that caroms several times before it 
hits its target, your moves must be planned and developed in the least ob­
vious way. By training yourself to be indirect, you can thrive in the modem 
court, appearing the paragon of decency while being the consummate ma­
nipulator. 
Consider The 48 Laws of Power a kind of handbook on the arts of indirec­
tion. The laws are based on the writings of men and women who have 
studied and mastered the game of power. These writings span aperiod of 
more than three thousand years and were created in civilizations as dis­
parate as ancient China and Renaissance Italy; yet they share common 
threads and themes, together hinting at an essence of power that has yet to 
be fully articulated. The 48 laws of power are the distillation of this accu­
mulated wisdom, gathered from the writings of the most illustrious strate­
gists (Sun-tzu, Clausewitz), statesmen (Bismarck, Talleyrand), courtiers 
(Castiglione, Graciän), seducers (Ninon de Lenclos, Casanova), and con 
artists ("Yellow Kid" Weil) in history. 
The laws have a simple premise: Certain actions almost always in­
crease one's power (the observance of the law), while others decrease it 
and even ruin us (the transgression of the law). These transgressions and 
observances are illustrated by historical examples. The laws are timeless 
and definitive. 
The 48 Laws of Power can be used in several ways. By reading the book 
straight through you can leam about power in general. Although several of 
the laws may seem not to pertain directly to your life, in time you will 
probably find that all of them have some application, and that in fact they 
are interrelated. By getting an overview of the entire subject you will best 
be able to evaluate your own past actions and gain a greater degree of con­
trol over your immediate affairs. A thorough reading of the book will in­
spire thinking and reevaluation long after you finish it. 
The book has also been designed for browsing and for examining the 
law that seems at that particular moment most pertinent to you. Say you 
are experiencing problems with a superior and cannot understand why 
YOUf efforts have not lead to more gratitude or a promotion. Severallaws 
specifically address the master-underling relationship, and you are almost 
certainly transgressing one of them. By browsing the initial paragraphs for 
the 48 laws in the table of contents, you can identify the pertinent law. 
Finally, the book can be browsed through and picked apart for enter­
tainment, for an enjoyable ride through the foibles and great deeds of our 
predecessors in power. A warning, however, to those who use the book for 
this purpose: It might be better to turn back. Power is endlessly seductive 
and deceptive in its own way. It is a labyrinth-your mind becomes con­
sumed with solving its infinite problems, and you so on realize how pleas­
antly lost you have become. In other words, it becomes most amusing by 
taking it seriously. Do not be frivolous with such a critical matter. The gods 
of power frown on the frivolous; they give ultimate satisfaction only to 
those who study and reflect, and punish those who skim the surfaces look­
ing for a good time. 
Any man who tries to be good alt the time is bound to come to ruin 
among the great number who are not good. Hence a prince who wants 
to keep his authority must leam how not to be good, and use that 
knowledge, or refrain from using it, as necessity requires.

2 LAW 1 TRAN SGR ESSION OF THE LAW 
Nicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV's finance minister in the first years ofhis reign, 
was a generous man who loved lavish parties, pretty women, and poetry. 
He also loved money, for he led an extravagant lifestyle. Fouquet was 
clever and very much indispensable to the king, so when the prime minis­
ter, Jules Mazarin, died, in 1661, the finance minister expected to be 
named the successor. Instead, the king decided to abolish the position. This 
and other signs made Fouquet suspect that he was falling out of favor, and 
so he decided to ingratiate hirnself with the king by staging the most spec­
tacular party the world had ever seen. The party's ostensible purpose 
would be to commemorate the completion of Fouquet's chateau, Vaux-Ie­
Vicomte, but its real function was to pay tribute to the king, the guest of 
honor. 
The most brilliant nobility of Europe and some of the greatest minds 
of the time-La Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Sevigne­
attended the party. Moliere wrote a play for the occasion, in which he 
hirnselfwas to perform at the evening's conclusion. The party began with a 
lavish seven-course dinner, featuring foods from the Orient never be­
fore tasted in France, as weH as new dishes created especiaHy for the night. 
The meal was accompanied with music commissioned by Fouquet to 
honor the king. 
Mter dinner there was a promenade through the chateau's gardens. 
The grounds and fountains of Vaux-Ie-Vicomte were to be the inspiration 
for VersaiHes. 
Fouquet personally accompanied the young king through the geomet­
rically aligned arrangements of shrubbery and flower beds. Arrlving at the 
gardens' canals, they witnessed a fireworks display, which was followed by 
the performance of Moliere's play. The party ran weH into the night and 
everyone agreed it was the most amazing affair they had ever attended. 
The next day, Fouquet was arrested by the king's head musketeer, 
D' Artagnan. Three months later he went on trial for stealing from the 
country's treasury. (Actually, most ofthe stealing he was accused ofhe had 
done on the king's behalf and with the king's permission.) Fouquet was 
found guilty and sent to the most isolated prison in France, high in the 
Pyrenees Mountains, where he spent the last twenty years of his life in soli­
tary confinement. 
Interpretation 
Louis XN, the Sun King, was a proud and arrogant man who wanted to be 
the center of attention at all times; he could not countenance being out­
done in lavishness by anyone, and certainly not his finance minister. To 
succeed Fouquet, Louis chose Jean-Baptiste Colbert, a man famous for his 
parsimony and for giving the duHest parties in Paris. Colbert made sure 
that any money liberated from the treasury went straight into Louis's 
hands. With the money, Louis built a palace even more magnificent than 
Fouquet's-the glorious palace of Versailles. He used the same architects, 
decorators, and garden designer. And at Versailles, Louis hosted parties 
even more extravagant than the one that cost Fouquet his freedom. 
Let us examine the situation. The evening of the party, as Fouquet pre­
sented spectacle on spectacle to Louis, each more magnificent than the one 
before, he imagined the affair as demonstrating his loyalty and devotion to 
the king. Not only did he think the party would put hirn back in the king's 
favor, he thought it would show his good taste, his connections, and his 
popularity, making hirn indispensable to the king and demonstrating that 
he would make an excellent prime minister. Instead, however, each new 
spectacle, each appreciative smile bestowed by the guests on Fouquet, 
made it seem to Louis that his own friends and subjects were more 
charmed by the finance minister than by the king hirnself, and that Fouquet 
was actually flaunting his wealth and power. Rather than flattering Louis 
XIV, Fouquet's elaborate party offended the king's vanity. Louis would not 
admit this to anyone, of course--instead, he found a convenient excuse to 
rid hirns elf of a man who had inadvertently made hirn feel insecure. 
Such is the fate, in some form or other, of all those who unbalance the 
master's sense of self, poke holes in his vanity, or make hirn doubt his pre­
eminence. 
When the evening began, Fouquet was at the top 0/ the world. 
By the time it had ended, he was at the bottom. 
Voltaire, 1694-1 778 
OB SERVAN CE OF THE LAW 
In the early 1600s, the ltalian astronomer and mathematician Galileo 
found hirnself in a precarious position. He depended on the generosity of 
great rulers to support his research, and so, like all Renaissance scientists, 
he would sometimes make gifts of his inventions and discoveries to the 
leading patrons of the time. Once, for instance, he presented a military 
compass he had invented to the Duke of Gonzaga. Then he dedicated a 
book explaining the use of the compass to the Medicis. Both rulers were 
grateful, and through them Galileo was able to find more students to teach. 
No matter how great the discovery, however, his patrons usually paid hirn 
with gifts, not cash. This made for a life of constant insecurity and depen­
dence. There must be an easier way, he thought. 
Galileo hit on a new strategy in 1610, when he discovered the moons 
of Jupiter. Instead of dividing the discovery among his patrons-giving 
one the telescope he had used, dedicating a book to another, and so on-as 
he had done in the past, he decided to focus exclusively on the Medicis. He 
chose the Medicis for one reason: Shortly after Cosimo I had established 
the Medici dynasty, in 1540, he had made Jupiter, the mightiest of the 
gods, the Medici symbol-a symbol of apower that went beyond politics 
and banking, one linked to ancient Rome and its divinities . 
Galileo tumed his discovery of Jupiter's moons into a cosmic event 
LAW 1 3 
4 LAW 1 honoring the Medicis' greatness. Shortly after the discovery, he announced 
that "the bright stars [the moons of Jupiterl offered themselves in the heav­
ens" to his telescope at the same time as Cosimo II's enthroneme nt. He 
said that the number of the moons-four-harmonized with the number of 
the Medicis (Cosimo 11 had three brothers) and that the moons orbited 
Jupiter as these four sons revolved around Cosimo I, the dynasty's founder. 
More than coincidence, this showed that the heavens themselves reflected 
the ascendancy of the Medici family. After he dedicated the discovery to 
the Medicis, Galileo commissioned an emblem representingJupiter sitting 
on a cloud with the four stars circling about hirn, and presented this to 
Cosimo 11 as a symbol of his link to the stars. 
In 1610 Cosimo 11 made Galileo his official court philosopher and 
mathematician, with a full salary. For a scientist this was the coup of a life­
time. The days of begging for patronage were over. 
Interpretation 
In one stroke, Galileo gained more with his new strategy than he had in 
years of begging. The reason is simple: All masters want to appear more 
brilliant than other people. 
They do not care about science or empirical truth or the latest inven­
tion; they care about their name and their glory. Galileo gave the Medicis 
infinitely more glory by linking their name with cosmic forces than he had 
by making them the patrons of some new scientific gadget or discovery. 
Scientists are not spared the vagaries of court life and patronage. They 
too must serve masters who hold the purse strings. And their great intellec­
tual powers can make the master feel insecure, as if he were only there to 
supply the funds-an ugly, ignoble job. The producer of a great work 
wants to feel he is more than just the provider of the financing. He wants to 
appear creative and powerful, and also more important than the work pro­
duced in his name. Instead of insecurity you must give hirn glory. Galileo 
did not challenge the intellectu� authority of the Medicis with his discov­
ery, or make them feel inferior in any way; by literally aligning them with 
the stars, he made them shine brilliantly among the courts of Italy. He did 
not outshine the master, he made the master outshine all others. 
KEYS TO POWER 
Everyone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world and dis­
play your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentrnent, envy, and 
other manifestations of insecurity. This is to be expected. You cannot spend 
your life worrying about the petty feelings of others. With those above you, 
however, you must take a different approach: When it comes to power, 
outshining the master is perhaps the worst mi stake of all. 
Do not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much since the 
days of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain high standing in life 
are like kings and queens: They want to feel secure in their positions, and 
superior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm. It is a deadly 
but common misperception to believe that by displaying and vaunting 
YOUf gifts and talents, you are winning the master's affection. He may feign 
appreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace you with someone 
less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis XIV replaced 
the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert. And as with Louis, he will 
not admit the truth, but will find an excuse to rid hirnself of YOUf presence. 
This Law involves two rules that you must realize. First, you can inad­
vertently outshine a master simply by being YOUfself. There are masters 
who are more insecure than others, monstrously insecUfe; you may natu­
rally outshine them by YOUf charm and grace. 
No one had more natural talents than Astorre Manfredi, prince of 
Faenza. The most handsome of all the young princes of Italy, he captivated 
his subjects with his generosity and open spirit. 
In the year 1500, Cesare Borgia laid siege to Faenza. When the city 
surrendered, the citizens expected the worst from the cruel Borgia, who, 
however, decided to spare the town: He simply occupied its fortress, exe­
cuted none of its citizens, and allowed Prince Manfredi, eighteen at the 
time, to remain with his court, in complete freedom. 
A few weeks later, though, soldiers hauled Astorre Manfredi away to a 
Roman prison. A year after that, his body was fished out of the River 
Tiber, a stone tied around his neck. Borgia justified the horrible deed with 
so me sort of trumped-up charge of treason and conspiracy, but the real 
problem was that he was notoriously vain and insecure. The young man 
was outshining hirn without even trying. Given Manfredi's natural talents, 
the prince's mere presence made Borgia seem less attractive and charis­
matic. The lesson is simple: If you cannot help being charming and supe­
rior, you must leam to avoid such monsters of vanity. Either that, or find a 
way to mute your good qualities when in the company of aCesare Borgia. 
Second, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do 
anything you want. Entire books could be written about favorites who fell 
out of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to outshine. In 
late-sixteenth-century Japan, the favorite of Emperor Hideyoshi was a man 
called Sen no Rikyu. The premier artist of the tea ceremony, which had be­
come an obsession with the nobility, he was one of Hideyoshi's most 
trusted advisers, had his own apartment in the palace, and was honored 
throughout Japan. Yet in 1591, Hideyoshi had hirn arrested and sentenced 
to death. Rikyu took his own life, instead. The cause for his sudden change 
of fortune was discovered later: It seems that Rikyu, former peasant and 
later court favorite, had had a wooden statue made of hirnself wearing san­
dals (a sign of nobility) and posing loftily. He had had this statue placed in 
the most important temple inside the palace gates, in clear sight of the roy­
alty who often would pass by. To Hideyoshi this signified that Rikyu had 
no sense of limits. Presuming that he had the same rights as those of the 
highest nobility, he had forgotten that his position depended on the em­
peror, and had co me to believe that he had earned it on his own. This was 
LAW 1 5 
6 LAW 1 an unforgivable miscalculation of his own importance and he paid for it 
with his life. Remember the following: Never take your position for 
granted and never let any favors you receive go to your head. 
Knowing the dangers of outshining your master, you can turn this Law 
to your advantage. First you must flatter and puff up your master. Overt 
flattery can be effective but has its limits; it is too direct and obvious, and 
looks bad to other courtiers. Discreet flattery is much more powerful. If 
you are more intelligent than your master, for example, seem the opposite: 
Make hirn appear more intelligent than you. Act naive. Make it seem that 
you need his expertise. Commit harmless mistakes that will not hurt you in 
the long run but will give you the chance to ask for his help. Masters adore 
such requests. A master who cannot bestow on you the gifts of his experi­
ence may direct rancor and ill will at you instead. 
If your ideas are more creative than your master's, ascribe them to 
hirn, in as public a manner as possible. Make it clear that your advice is 
merely an echo of his advice. 
If you surpass your master in wit, it is okay to play the role of the court 
jester, but do not make hirn appear cold and surly by comparison. Tone 
down your humor if necessary, and find ways to make hirn seem the dis­
penser of amusement and good cheer. If you are naturally more sociable 
and generous than your master, be careful not to be the cloud that blocks 
his radiance from others. He must appear as the sun around which every­
one revolves, radiating power and brilliance, the center of attention. If you 
are thrust into the position of entertaining hirn, a display of your limited 
means may win you his sympathy . Any attempt to impress hirn with your 
grace and generosity can prove fatal: Learn from Fouquet or pay the price. 
In all of these cases it is not a weakness to disguise your strengths if 
in the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain 
in control, instead of being a victim of their insecurity. This will all come in 
handy the day you decide to rise above your inferior status. If, like Galileo, 
you can make your master shine even more in the eyes of others, then you 
are a godsend and you will be instantly promoted.

one sun at a time. Never 
obscure the sunlight, or 
riyal the sun's brilliance; 
rather, fade into the sky and 
find ways to heighten 
the master star's 
intensity. 
Authority: Avoid outshining the master. All superiority is odious, but the 
superiority of a subject over his prince is not only stupid, it is fatal. This is a 
lesson that the stars in the sky teach us-they may be related to the sun, 
and just as brilliant, but they never appear in her company. (Baltasar 
Gracian, 1601-165R) 
REVERSAL 
You cannot worry about upsetting every person you corne across, but you 
must be selectively cruel. If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing 
to fear from outshining hirn. Do not be merciful-your master had no such 
scruples in his own cold-blooded climb to the top. Gauge his strength. If he 
is weak, discreetly hasten his downfall: Outdo, outcharm, outsrnart hirn at 
key moments . If he is very weak and ready to fall, let nature take its course. 
Do not risk outshining a feeble superior-it rnight appear cruel or spiteful. 
But if your master is firm in his position, yet you know yourself to be the 
more capable, bide your time and be patient. It is the natural course of 
things that power eventually fades and weakens. Your master will fall 
someday, and if you play it right, you will outlive and sorneday outshine 
hirn.

In fact, you have more to fear from friends than from en­

TRANSGRESSIO N OF THE LAW 
In the mid-ninth century A.D., a young man named Michael III assumed 
the throne of the Byzantine Empire. His mother, the Empress Theodora, 
had been banished to a nunnery, and her lover, Theoctistus, had been mur­
dered; at the head of the conspiracy to depose Theodora and enthrone 
Michael had been Michael's unde, Bardas, a man of intelligence and ambi­
tion. Michael was now a young, inexperienced mIer, surrounded by in­
triguers, murderers, and profligate s. In this time of peril he needed 
someone he could trust as his councillor, and his thoughts tumed to Basil­
ius, his best friend. Basilius had no experience whatsoever in govemment 
and politics-in fact, he was the head of the royal stables-but he had 
proven his love and gratitude time and again. 
They had met a few years before, when Michael had been visiting the 
stables just as a wild horse got loose. Basilius, a young groom from peasant 
Macedonian stock, had saved Michael's life. The groom's strength and 
courage had impressed Michael, who immediately raised Basilius from the 
obscurity of being a horse trainer to the position of head of the stables. He 
loaded his friend with gifts and favors and they became inseparable. Basil­
ius was sent to the finest school in Byzantium, and the cmde peasant be­
came a cultured and sophisticated courtier. 
Now Michael was emperor, and in need of someone loyal. Who could 
he better trust with the post of chamberlain and chief councillor than a 
young man who owed hirn everything? 
Basilius could be trained for the job and Michael loved hirn like a 
brother. Ignoring the advice of those who recommended the much more 
qualified Bardas, Michael chose his friend. 
Basilius leamed weIl and was so on advising the emperor on all matters 
of state. The only problem seemed to be money-Basilius never had 
enough. Exposure to the splendor of Byzantine court life made hirn avari­
cious for the perks of power. Michael doubled, then tripled his salary, en­
nobled hirn, and married hirn off to his own mistress, Eudoxia Ingerina. 
Keeping such a trusted friend and adviser satisfied was worth any price. 
But more trouble was to come. Bardas was now head of the army, and 
Basilius convinced Michael that the man was hopelessly ambitious. Under 
the illusion that he could control his nephew, Bardas had conspired to put 
hirn on the throne, and he could conspire again, this time to get rid of 
Michael and assurne the crown hirnself. Basilius poured poison into 
Michael's ear until the emperor agreed to have his unde murdered. During 
a great horse race, Basilius dosed in on Bardas in the crowd and stabbed 
hirn to death. So on after, Basilius asked that he replace Bardas as head of 
the army, where he could keep control of the realm and quell rebellion. 
This was granted. 
Now Basilius's power and wealth only grew, and a few years later 
Michael, in financial straits from his own extravagance, asked hirn to pay 
back some of the money he had borrowed over the years. To Michael's 
shock and astonishment, Basilius refused, with a look of such impudence To have a good enemy, 
choose a [riend: He 
knows where to strike.

heavy drinking, Michael awoke to find hirnself sUITounded by soldie rs. 
Basilius watched as they stabbed the emperor to death. Then, after pro­
claiming hirnself emperor, he rode his horse through the streets of Byzan­
tium, brandishing the head of his former benefactor and best friend at the 
end of a lang pike. 
Interpretation 
Michael III staked his future on the sense of gratitude he thought Basilius 
must feel for hirn . Surely Basilius would serve hirn best; he owed the em­
peror his wealth, his education, and his position. Then, once Basilius was in 
power, anything he needed it was best to give to hirn, strengthening the 
bonds between the two men. It was only on the fateful day when the em­
peror saw that impudent smile on Basilius's face that he realized his deadly 
mistake. 
He had created a monster. He had allowed a man to see power up 
close-a man who then wanted more, who asked for anything and got it, 
who feit encumbered by the charity he had received and simply did what 
many people da in such a situat ion: They forget the favors they have re­
ceived and imagine they have eamed their success by their own merits . 
At Michael 's moment ofrealization, he could still have saved his own 
life, but friendship and love blind every man to their interests. Nobody be­
lieves a friend can betray. And Michael went on disbelieving until the day 
his head ended up on a pike . 
Lord, protect me from my friends; I can take care of my enemies.

OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW 
For several centuries after the fall of the Han Dynasty (A.D. 222), Chinese his­
tory followed the same pattern of violent and bloody coups, one after the 
other. Army men would plot to kill a weak emperor, then would replace hirn 
on the Dragon Throne with a strong general. The general would start a new 
dynasty and crown hirnself emperor; to ensure his own survival he would kill 
offhis fellow generals. A few years later, however, the pattern would resume: 
New generals would rise up and assassinate hirn or his sons in their turn. To 
be emperor of China was to be alone, sUITounded by a pack of enemies-it 
was the least powerful, least secure position in the realm. 
In A.D. 959, General Chao K'uang-yin became Em peror Sung. He 
knew the odds, the prob ability that within a year or two he would be mur­
dered; how could he break the pattern? Soon after becoming emperor, 
Sung ordered a banquet to celebrate the new dynasty, and invited the most 
powerful commanders in the army . Mter they had drunk much wine, he 
someone is repaying a kindnes.1: 
AFRICA N FOLK TA/I 
dismissed the guards and everybody else except the generals, who now 
feared he would murder them in one fell swoop. Instead, he addressed 
them: "The whole day is spent in fear, and I am unhappy both at the table 
and in my bed. For which one of you does not dream of ascending the 
throne? I do not doubt your allegiance, but if by some chance your subor­
dinates, seeking wealth and position, were to force the emperor's yellow 
robe upon you in turn, how could you refuse it?" Drunk and fearing for 
their lives, the generals proclaimed their innocence and their loyalty. But 
Sung had other ideas: "The best way to pass one's days is in peaceful en­
joyment of riches and honor. If you are willing to give up your commands, 
I am ready to provide you with fine estates and beautiful dwellings where 
you may take your pleasure with singers and girls as your companions." 
The astonished generals realized that instead of a life of anxiety and 
stru ggle Sung was offering them riches and security . The next day, all of 
the generals tendered their resignations, and they retired as nobles to the 
estates that Sung bestowed on them. 
In one stroke, Sung turned a pack of "friendly" wolves, who would 
likely have betrayed hirn, into a group of docile lambs, far from all power . 
Over the next few years Sung continued his campaign to secure his 
rule. In A.D. 971, King Liu of the Southern Han finally surrendered to him 
after years of rebellion. To Liu's astonishment, Sung gave hirn a rank in the 
imperial court and invited hirn to the palace to seal their newfound friend­
ship with wine. As King Liu took the glass that Sung offered hirn, he hesi­
tated, fearing it contained poison. "Your subject's crimes certainly merit 
death," he cried out, "but I beg Your Majesty to spare your subject's life. In­
deed I dare not drink this wine." Emperor Sung laughed, took the glass 
from Liu, and swallowed it hirnself. There was no poison. From then on 
Liu became his �ost trusted and loyal friend . 
At the time, China had splintered into many smaller kingdoms. When 
Ch'ien Shu, the king of one of these, was defeated, Sung's ministers ad­
vised the emperor to lock this rebel up. They presented documents prov­
ing that he was still conspiring to kill Sung. When Ch'ien Shu came to visit 
the emperor, however, instead of locking hirn up, Sung honored hirn. He 
also gave hirn a package, which he told the former king to open when he 
was halfway horne. Ch'ien Shu opened the bundle on his return journey 
and saw that it contained all the papers documenting his conspir acy. He re­
alized that Sung knew of his murderous plans, yet had spared hirn nonethe­
less. This generosity won hirn over, and he too became one of Sung's most 
loyal vassals. 
Interpretation 
A Chinese proverb compares friends to the jaws and teeth of a dangerous 
animal: If you are not careful, you will find them chewing you up. Em peror 
Sung knew the jaws he was passing between when he assumed the throne: 
His "friends" in the army would chew hirn up like meat, and if he some­
how survived, his "friends" in the government would have hirn for supper . There are many who 
think therefore that a 
wise prince ollght, 
when he has the 
chance, to foment 
astl/tely same enmity, 
so that hy suppressillg 
it he will augment his 
greatness. Princes, and 
especially new ones, 
have fOllnd more fäith 
and more usefulness in 
those men, wh om at the 
heginning oftheir 
power they regarded 
with slIspidon, than in 
those they at first 
con{ided in. Pandolfo

Siena, governed his 
state more by those 
whom he suspected

12 LAW 2 Emperor Sung would have no truck with "friends" -he bribed his fellow 
generals with splendid estates and kept them far away. This was a much 
better way to emasculate them than killing them, which would only have 
led other generals to seek vengea nce. And Sung would have nothing to do 
with "friendly" ministers. More often than not, they would end up drinking 
his fam ous cup of poisoned wine. 
Instead of relying on friends, Sung used his enemies, one after the 
other, transforming them into far more reliable subjects. Wh ile a friend ex­
pects more and more favors, and seethes with jealousy, these former ene­
mies expected nothing and got everything. A man suddenly spared the 
guillotine is a gratenIl man indeed, and will go to the ends of the earth for 
the man who has pardoned hirn. In time, these former enemies became 
Sung's most trusted friends. 
And Sung was finally able to break the pattern of coups, violence, and 
civil war-th e Sung Dynasty ruled China for more than three hundred 
years. 
In a speech Abraham Lincoln delivered at the height of the Civil War, 
he referred to the Southerners as fellow human beings who were in

enemies who must be destroyed. "Why, madam," Lincoln replied, 
"do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?" 
KEY S TO POWE R 
It is natural to want to employ your friends when you find yourself in times 
of need. The world is a harsh place, and your friends soften the har shness. 
Besides, you know them. Wh y depend on astranger when you have a 
friend at hand ? 
The problem is that you often do not know your friends as weIl as you 
imagin e. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument. 
They cover up their unpleasant quali ties so as to not offend each other. 
They laugh extra hard at each other's jokes. Since honesty rarely strength­
ens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels. Friends will 
say that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste in 
clothes-maybe they mean it, often they do not. 
When you decide to hire a friend, you gradually discover the qualit ies 
he or she has kept hidden. Strangely enough, it is your act of kindne ss that 
unbala nces everything. People want to feel they des erve their good for­
tune. The receipt of a favor can become oppressive : It means you have 
been chosen because you are a friend, not necessa rily because you are de­
serving. There is almost a touch of condescension in the act of hiring 
friends that secretly afflicts them. The injury will come out slowly : A little 
more honesty, flashes of resentment and envy here and there, and before 
you know it your friendship fades. The more favors and gifts you supply to 
revive the friendship, the less gratitude you receive. 
Ingratitu de has a long and deep histor y. It has demonstrated its powers 
for so many centurie s, that it is truly amazing that people continue to un­
derestimate them. Better to be wary. If you never expect gratitude from a 
friend, you will be pleasa ntly surprised when they do prove grateful . 
The problem with using or hiring friends is that it will inevitably limit 
your power. The friend is rarely the one who is most able to help you; and 
in the end, skill and competence are far more important than friendly feel­
ings. (Michael III had a man right under his no se who would have steered 
hirn right and kept hirn alive: That man was Bardas .) 
All working situations require a kind of dista nce between people. You 
are trying to work, not make friends; friendliness (real or false) only ob­
scures that fact. The key to power, then, is the ability to judge who is best 
able to further your interests in all situatio ns. Keep friends for friendship, 
but work with the skilIed and competent . 
Your enemies, on the other hand, are an untapped gold mine that you 
must learn to exploit. When Talleyrand , Napoleon's foreign minister, de­
cided in 1807 that his boss was leading France to ruin, and the time had 
come to turn against hirn, he understood the dangers of conspiring against 
the emperor; he needed a partner, a confedera te--what friend could he 
trust in such a pro ject? He chose Joseph Fouc he, head of the secret police, 
his most hated enemy, a man who had even tried to have hirn assassinated. 
He knew that their former hatred would create an opportunity for an emo­
tional reconciliation. He knew that Fouche would expect nothing from 
hirn, and in fact would work to prove that he was worthy of Talleyrand's 
choice; a person who has somet hing to prove will move mountains for you. 
Finally, he knew that his relationship with Fouche would be based on mu­
tual self-in terest, and would not be contaminated by personal feeling. The 
selection proved perfect; although the conspirators did not succeed in top­
pling Napoleon, the union of such powerful but unlikely partners gener­
ated much interest in the cause; opposition to the emperor slowly began to 
spread. And from then on, Talleyrand and Fouche had a fruitful working 
relati onship . Whenever you can, bury the hatc het with an enemy, and 
make a point of putting hirn in your service. 
As Lincoln said, you destroy an enemy when you make a friend of 
hirn. In 1971, during the Vietnam War, Henry Kissinger was the targe t of 
an unsuccessful kidnapping attempt, a conspiracy involving, among others, 
the renowned antiwar activist priests the Berrigan brothers, four more 
Catholic priests, and four nuns. In private, without informing the Secret 
Service or the Justice Department, Kissinger arranged a Saturday-morning 
meeting with three of the alleged kidna ppers. Explaining to his guests that 
he would have most American soldiers out of Vietnam by mid-1972, he 
completely charm ed them. They gave hirn some "Kidnap Kissinger" but­
tons and one of them remained a friend of his for years, visiting hirn on 
several occasions. This was not just a onetime ploy: Kissinger made a pol­
icy of working with those who disag reed with hirn. Colleagues commented 
that he seemed to get along better with his enemies than with his friends.

14 LAW 2 then, to use enemies as enemies rather than transforming them into friends 
or allies. 
Mao Tse-tung saw conflict as key in his approach to power. In 1937 the 
Japanese invaded China, interrupting the civil war between Mao's Com­
munists and their enemy, the Nationalists. 
Fearing that the Japanese would wipe them out, some Communist 
leaders advocated leaving the Nationalists to fight the Japanese, and using 
the time to recuperate. Mao disagreed: The Japanese could not possibly 
defeat and occupy a vast country like China for long. Once they left, the 
Communists would have grown rusty if they had been out of combat for 
several years, and would be ill prepared to reopen their struggle with the 
Nationalists. To fight a formidable foe like the Japanese, in fact, would be 
the perfect training for the Communists' ragtag army. Mao's plan was 
adopted, and it worked: By the time the Japanese finally retreated, the 
Communists had gained the fighting experience that helped them defeat 
the Nationalists. 
Years later, a Japanese visitor tried to apologize to Mao for his coun­
try's invasion of China. Mao interrupted, "Should I not thank you in­
stead?" Without a worthy opponent, he explained, a man or group cannot 
grow stronger. 
Mao's strategy of constant conflict has several key components. First, 
be certain that in the long run you will emerge victorious. Never pick a 
fight with someone you are not sure you can defeat, as Mao knew the 
Japanese would be defeated in time. Second, if you have no apparent ene­
mies, you must sometimes set up a convenient target, even tuming a friend 
into an enemy. Mao used this tactic time and again in politics. Third, use 
such enemies to define your cause more clearly to the public, even framing 
it as a struggle of good against evil. Mao actually encouraged China's dis­
agreements with the Soviet Union and the United States; without clear-cut 
enemies, he believed, his people would lose any sense of what Chinese 
Communism meant. A sharply defined enemy is a far stronger argument 
for your side than all the words you could possibly put together. 
Never let the presence of enemies upset or distress you-you are far 
better off with a declared opponent or two than not knowing where your 
real enemies lie. The man of power welcomes conflict, using enemies to 
enhance his reputation as a surefooted fighter who can be relied upon in 
times of uncertainty.

REVERSAL 
Although it is generally best not to mix work with friendship, there are 
times when a friend can be used to greater effect than an enemy. A man of 
power, for example, often has dirty work that has to be done, but for the 
sake of appearances it is generally preferable to have other people do it for 
him; friends often do this the best, since their affection for hirn makes them 
willing to take chances. Also, if YOUf plans go awry for some reason, you 
can use a friend as a convenient scapegoat. This "fall of the favorite" was a 
trick often used by kings and sovereigns: They would let their dosest friend 
at court take the fall for amistake, since the public would not believe that 
they would deliberately sacrifice a friend for such a purpose. Of course, 
after you play that card, you have lost your friend forever. It is best, then, to 
reserve the scapegoat role for someone who is dose to you but not too 
elose. 
Finally, the problem ab out working with friends is that it confuses the 
boundaries and distances that working requires. But if both partners in the 
arrangement understand the dangers involved, a friend often can be em­
ployed to great effect. You must never let YOUf guard down in such a ven­
ture, however; always be on the lookout for any signs of emotional 
disturbance such as envy and ingratitude. Nothing is stable in the realm of 
power, and even the dosest offriends can be transformed into the worst of 
enemies.

TRA NSGR ESSION OF THE LAW 
Over several weeks, Ninon de Lenclos, the most inf amous courtesan of 
seventeenth-century Fran ce, listened patiently as the Marquis de Sevigne 
explained his stru ggles in pursuing a heautiful hut difficult young count ess. 
Ninon was sixty-two at the time, and more than experienced in matters of 
love; the marquis was a lad of twenty-two, handsome, dashing, hut hope­
lessly inexperienced in romance. At first Ninon was amused to hear the 
marquis talk ahout his mistake s, hut finally she had had enough . Unahle to 
hear ineptitude in any realm, least of all in seducing a woman, she decided 
to take the young man under her wing. First, hE\ had to und erstand that this 
was war, and that the heautiful countess was a Citadel to which he had to 
lay siege as carefully as any general. Every step had to he planned and exe­
cuted with the utmost attention to detail and nuance. 
Instructing the marquis to start over, Ninon told him to approach the 
countess with a hit of distance, an air of nonchala nce. The next time the 
two were alone together, she said, he would confide in the countess as 
would a friend hut nota poten tial lover. This was to throw her offthe scent. 
The countess was no longer to take his interest in her for granted-p erhaps 
he was only interested in friendship. 
Ninon planned ahead. Once the countess was confused, it would he 
time to make her jealous. At the next encounter, at a major fete in Paris, the 
marquis would show up with a heautiful young woman at his side. This 
hea utiful young woman had equally hea utiful friends, so that wherever the 
countess would now see the marquis, he would he surround ed hy the most 
stunning young women in Paris. Not only would the countess he seething 
with jealousy, she would come to see the marquis as someone who was de­
sired hy othe rs. It was hard far Ninon to make the marquis understand, hut 
she patiently explained that a woman who is interested in a man wants to 
see that other women are interested in him, to�. Not only does that give 
him instant value, it makes it all the more satisfying to snatch him from 
their clutc hes. 
Once the countess was jealous hut intrigue d, it would he time to he­
guil e her. On Ninon's instructions, the marquis would fail to show up at af­
fairswhere the countess expected to see him. Then, suddenly, he would 
appear at salons he had never frequented hefore, hut that the countess at-
LAW 3 17 
18 LAW 3 tended often. She would be unable to predict his moves. All of this would 
push her into the state of emotional confusion that is aprere quisite for suc­
cessful seduct ion. 
These moves were executed, and took several weeks. Ninon moni­
tored the marquis's progr ess: Through her network of spies, she heard how 
the countess would laugh a litde harder at his witticisms, listen more 
closely to his stories . She heard that the countess was suddenly asking ques­
tions about hirn. Her friends told her that at social affairs the countess 
would often look up at the marquis, following his steps. Ninon feJt certain 
that the young woman was falling under his spell. It was a matter of weeks 
now, maybe a month or two, but if all went smoothly, the citadel would 
fall. 
A few days later the marquis was at the countess's horne. They were 
alone. Suddenly he was a different man: This time acting on his own im­
pulse, rather than following Ninon's instructions, he took the countess's 
hands and told her he was in love with her. The young woman seemed 
confused, areaction he did not expect. She became polite, then excused 
herself. For the rest of the evening she avoided his eyes, was not there to 
say good-night to hirn. The next few times he visited he was told she was 
not at horne. When she finally admitted hirn again, the two feIt awkward 
and uncomfortable with each other. The spell was broken. 
Interpretation 
Ninon de Lenclos knew everything about the art of love. The greatest writ­
ers, thinkers, and politicians of the time had been her lovers-men like La 
Rochefoucauld, Moliere, and Richelieu. Seduction was agame to her, to be 
practiced with skill. As she got older, and her reputation grew, the most im­
portant families in France would send their sons to her to be instructed in 
matters oflove. 
Ninon knew that men and women are very different, but when it 
comes to seduction they feel the same: Deep down inside, they often sense 
when they are being seduced, but they give in because they enjoy the feel­
ing of being led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to allow the other per­
son to detour you into a stra nge country. Everything in seduction, 
however, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce yOUf intentions or 
reveal them direcdy in words. Instead you must throw your targets off the 
scent. To surrender to YOUf guidance they must be appropriately confused. 
You have to scramble your signals -appear interested in another man or 
woman (the decoy), then hint at being interested in the target, then feign 
indifference, on and on. Such patterns not only confuse, they excite. 
Imagine this story from the countess's persp ective: After a few of the 
marquis's moves, she sensed the marquis was playing some sort of game, 
but the game delighted her. She did not know where he was leading her, 
but so much the better. His moves intrigued her, each of them keeping her 
waiting for the next one--she even enjoyed her jealousy and confusion, for 
sometimes any emotion is better than the boredom of securi ty. Perhaps the 
marquis had uIterior motives; most men do. But she was willing to wait and 
see, and probably if she had been made to wait long enough, what he was 
up to would not have mat tered. 
The moment the marquis utte red that fatal word "love," however, all 
was changed. This was no longer agame with moves, it was an artless show 
of passion. His intention was revealed: He was seducing her. This put 
everything he had done in a new light. All that before had been charming 
now seemed ugly and conniving; the countess feit embarrassed "and used. 
A door closed that would never open again. 
Do not be held a cheat, even though it is impossible to live today without being one. 
Let your greatest cunning lie in covering up what looks like cunning.

OBSER VA NCE OF THE LAW 
In 1850 the young Otto von Bismarck, then a thirt y-five-year-old deputy in 
the Prussian parliament, was at a turning point in his career . The issues of 
the day were the unification of the many states (including Prussia) into 
which Germany was then divided, and a war against Austria, the powerful 
neighbor to the south that hoped to keep the Germans weak and at odds, 
even threatening to intervene if they tried to unite. Prince William, next in 
line to be Prussia's king, was in favor of going to war, and the parliament 
rallied to the cause, prepared to back any mobilization of troops. The only 
ones to oppose war were the present king, Frederick William IV, and his 
ministers, who preferred to appease the powerful Austrians. 
Throughout his career, Bismarck had been a loyal, even passionate 
supporter of Prussian might and power. He dreamed of German unifica­
tion, of going to war against Austria and humiliating the country that for so 
long had kept Germany divided. A former soldier, he saw warf are as a glo­
rious business. 
This, after all, was the man who years later would say, "The great 
questions of the time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions, but 
by iron and blood." 
Passionate patriot and lover of military glory, Bismarck nevertheless 
gave a speech in parliament at the height of the war fever that astonished 
all who heard it. "Woe unto the stat esman," he said, "who makes war with­
out a reason that will still be valid when the war is over! After the war, you 
will all look differently at these questions. Will you then have the courage 
to turn to the peasant contemplating the ashes of his farm, to the man who 
has been crippled, to the father who has lost his children?" Not only did 
Bismarck go on to talk of the madness of this war, but, strangest of all, he 
praised Austria and defended her actions. This went against everything he 
had stood for. The consequences were immediate. Bismarck was against 
the war-what could this possibly mean? Other deputies were confused, 
and several of them changed their votes. Eventually the king and his minis­
ters won out, and war was averted. 
A few weeks after Bismarck's infamous speech, the king, grateful that 
LAW 3 19 
20 LAW 3 he had spoken for peace, made hirn a cabinet minister. A few years later he 
became the Prussian premier. In this role he eventuaIly led his country and 
a peace-loving king into a war against Austria, crushing the former empire 
and establishing a mighty German state, with Prussia at its head. 
Interpretation 
At the time of his speech in 1850, Bismarck made several calculati ons. 
First, he sensed that the Prussian military, which had not kept pace with 
other European armies, was unready for war-that Austria, in fact, might 
very weIl win, a disastrous result for the future . Second, if the war were lost 
and Bismarck had supported it, his career would be gravely jeopardized. 
The king and his conserv ative ministers wanted peace; Bisma rck wanted 
power. The answer was to throw people off the scent by supporting a cause 
he detested, saying things he would laugh at if said by another. A whole 
country was fooled. It was because of Bismarck's speech that the king made 
hirn aminister, a position from which he quickly rose to be prime minister, 
attaining the power to strengthen the Prussian military and accomplish 
what he had wanted all along: the humiliation of Austria and the unifica­
tion of Germany under Prus sia's leadership. 
Bismarck was certainly one of the cleverest state sman who ever lived, 
a master of strategy and deception. No one suspected what he was up to in 
this case. Had he ann ounced his real intent ions, arguing that it was better 
to wait now and fight later, he would not have won the argument, since 
most Prussians wanted war at that moment and mistakenly believed that 
their army was superior to the Austrians. Had he played up to the king, 
asking to be made a minister in exchange for supporting peace, he would 
not have succeeded either : The king would have distrusted his ambition 
and doubted his sincerity. 
By being completely insincere and sending misleading signal s, how­
ever, he deceived everyone, concealed his purpose, and attained every­
thing he wante d. Such is the power of hiding your intent ions. 
KEYS TO PO WER 
Most people are open books. They say what they feel, blurt out their opin­
ions at every opportunity, and constantly reveal their plans and intent ions. 
They do this for several reasons. First, it is easy and natural to always want 
to talk about one's feelings and plans for the future. It takes effort to control 
your tongue and monitor what you reveal. Second, many believe that by 
being honest and open they are winning people's hearts and showing their 
good natu re.T hey are greatly deluded. Honesty is actually a blunt instru­
ment, which bloodies more than it cuts . Your honesty is likely to offend 
people; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what 
they want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you feel or 
think. More important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so 
predictable and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or fear you, 
and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions. 
If you yearn for power, quickly lay honesty aside, and train yourself in 
the art of concealing your intentions. Master the art and you will always 
have the upper hand. Basic to an ability to conceal one's intentions is a 
simple truth about human nature: Our first instinct is to always trust ap­
pearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of what we see and 
hear-constantly imagining that appearances concealed something else 
would exhaust and terrify uso This fact makes it relatively easy to conceal 
one's intentions. Simply dangle an object you seem to desire, a goal you 
seem to aim for, in front of people's eyes and they will take the appearance 
for reality. Once their eyes foeus on the decoy, they will fail to notice what 
you are really up to. In seduction, set up conflictin �signals, such as desire 
and indifference, and you not only throw them off the scent, you inflame 
their desire to possess you. 
A tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to appear to 
support an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own sentiment s. 
(Bismarck used this to great effect in his speech in 1850.) Most people will 
believe you have experienced a change of heart, since it is so unusual to 
play so lightly with something as emotional as one's opinions and values. 
The same applies for any decoyed object of desire: Seem to want some­
thing in which you are actually not at all interested and your enemies will 
be throWll off the scent, making all kinds of errors in their calculatio ns. 
During the War of the Spanish Succession in 1711, the Duke of Marl­
borough, head of the English army, wanted to destroy a key French fort, 
because it proteeted a vital thoroughfare into Franee. Yet he knew that if he 
destroyed it, the French would realize what he wanted-to advance down 
that road. Instead, then, he merely captured the fort, and garrisoned it with 
some of his troops, making it appear as if he wanted it for some purpose of 
his OWll. The French attaeked the fort and the duke let them reeapture it. 
Once they had it back, though, they destroyed it, figuring that the duke had 
wanted it for some important reason. Now that the fort was gone, the road 
was unprotected, and Marlborough could easily march into France. 
Use this tactie in the following manner: Hide your intentions not by 
closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspi­
cious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals-just not yOUf 
real ones. You will kill three birds with one stone: You appear friendly, 
open, and trusting; you conceal YOUf intentions; and you send YOUf rivals 
on time-consuming wild-goose ehases. 
Another powerful tool in throwing people off the scent is false sineer­
ity. People easily mistake sincerity for honesty. Remember-their first in­
stinet is to trust appearances, and sinee they value honesty and want to 
believe in the honesty of those around them, they will rarely doubt you or 
see through YOUf aet. Seeming to believe what you say gives your words 
great weight. This is how Iago deceived and destroyed Othello: Given the 
depth of his emotions, the apparent sincerity of his coneems about Desde­
mona's supposed infidelity, how eould Othello distrust hirn? This is also 
how the great con artist Yellow Kid Weil pulled the wool over suckers' 
eyes: Seeming to believe so deeply in the deeoyed object he was dangling 
LAW 3 21 
22 LAW 3 in front of them (a phony stock, a touted racehors e), he made its reality 
hard to doubt. It is important, of course, not to go too far in this area. Sin­
cerity is a tricky tool: Appear overpassionate and you raise suspicions. Be 
measured and believable or your ruse will seem the put-on that it iso 
To make your false sincerity an effective weapon in concealing your 
intentions, espouse a belief in honesty and forthrigh tness as important so­
cial values. Do this as publicly as possible. Emphasize your position on this 
subject by occasionally divulging some heartfelt thought-though only one 
that is actually meaning less or irrelevant, of course. Napoleon's minister 
Talleyrand was a master at taking people into his confidence by revealing 
some apparent secret. This feigned confidence-a decoy -would then 
elicit areal confidence on the other person's part. r Rememb er: The best deceivers do everything they can to cloak their 
roguish qual ities. They cultivate an air of honesty in one area to disguise 
I their dishonesty in others. Honesty is merely another decoy in their arsenal 
) of weap ons.

PART II: USE SMOK E SCREENS TO 
DISGUISE YO UR ACTI ONS 
Deception is always the best strategy, but the best deceptions require a screen 
of smoke to distract people's attention from your real pur pose. The bland 
exterior-like the unreadable poker face-is often the perfect smoke screen, 
hiding your intentions behind the comfortable and familiar. If you lead the 
sucker down a familiar path, he won 't catch on when you lead him into a 
trap. 
OBSER VA NCE OF THE LAW I 
In 1910, a Mr. Sam Geezil of Chicago sold his warehouse business for close 
to $1 million. He settled down to semiretirement and the managing of his 
many properties, but deep inside he itched for the old days of deal-making. 
One day a young man namedJoseph Weil visited his office, wanting to buy 
an apartment he had up for sale. Geezil explained the terms : The price was 
$8,000, but he only required a down payment of $2,000. Weil said he 
would sleep on it, but he came back the following day and offered to pay 
the full $8,000 in cash, if Geezil could wait a couple of days, until a deal 
Weil was working on came through. Even in semiretirement, a clever busi­
nessman like Geezil was curious as to how Weil would be able to come up 
with so much cash (roughly $150,000 today) so quickly. Weil seemed reluc­
tant to say, and quickly changed the subj ect, but Geezil was persistent. Fi­
nally, after assurances of confidentiality, Weil told Geezil the following 
story. 
Weil's uncle was the secretary to a coterie of multimillionaire fi­
nanciers. These wealthy gentlemen had purchas ed a hunting lodge in 
Michigan ten years ago, at a cheap price. They had not used the lodge for a 
few years, so they had decided to seIl it and had asked Weil's uncle to get 
whatever he could for it. For reasons -go od reasons-of his own, the uncle 
had been nursing a grudge against the millionaires for years ; this was his 
chance to get back at them. He would seIl the property for $35,000 to a set­
up man (whom it was Weil's job to find) . The financiers were too wealthy to 
worry about this low price. The set-up man would then turn around and 
seIl the property again for its real price, around $155,000. The uncle, Weil, 
and the third man would split the profits from this second sale. It was all 
legal and for a good cause-the uncle's just retribut ion. 
Geezil had heard enough : He wanted to be the set-up buyer. Weil was 
reluctant to involve hirn, but Geezil would not back down : The idea of a 
large profit, plus a little adventure, had hirn champing at the bit. Weil ex­
plained that Geezil would have to put up the $35,000 in cash to bring the 
deal off. Geezil, a millionaire, said he could get the money with a snap of 
his fing ers. Weil finally relented and agreed to arrange a meeting between 
the uncle, Geezil, and the financiers, in the town of Galesburg, Illin ois. 
On the train ride to Galesburg, Geezil met the uncle-an impressive .1 1"111 r "I"<: OF ISHAE I..

as soon as he had made 
an end of offering the

said to the guard and to 
the officers, "Go in and 
slay them; let not a man

So when they put them 
to the sword, the guard 
and the officers cast 
them out and went into 
the inner room of the

brought out the pillar 
that was in the house of

And they demolished

24 LAW 3 man, with whom he avidly discussed business, Weil also brought along a 
companion, a somewhat paunchy man named George Gross. Weil ex­
plained to Geezil that he hirnself was a boxing trainer, that Gross was one 
of the promising prizefighters he trained, and that he had asked Gross to 
come along to make sure the fighter stayed in shape. For a promising 
fighter, Gross was unimpressive look ing-he had gray hair and a beer 
belly-but Geezil was so excited about the deal that he didn't really think 
ab out the man's flabby appeara nce. 
Once in Galesburg, Weil and his uncle went to fetch the financiers 
while Geezil waited in a hotel room with Gross, who promptly put on his 
boxing trunks. As Geezil half watch ed, Gross began to shadow box. Dis­
tracted as he was, Geezil ignored how badly the boxer whe ezed after a few 
minutes of exercise, although his style seemed real enough. An hour later, 
Weil and his uncle reappeared with the financ iers, an impressive, intimidat­
ing group of men, all wearing fancy suits. The meeting went well and the fi­
nanciers agreed to sell the lodge to Geezil, who had already had the 
$35,000 wired to a local bank. 
This minor business now settle d, the financiers sat back in their chairs 
and began to banter about high financ e, throwing out the name 'j. P. Mor­
gan" as if they knew the man. Finally one of them noticed the boxer in the 
corner of the room. Weil explained what he was doing there. The financier 
countered that he too had a boxer in his entourage, whom he named. Weil 
laughed brazenly and exclaimed that his man could easily knock out their 
man. Conversation escalated into argument. In the heat of passion, Weil 
challenged the men to a bet. The financiers eagerly agreed and left to get 
their man ready for a fight the next day. 
As soon as they had left, the uncle yelled at Weil, right in front of 
Geezil: They did not have enough money to bet with, and once the fi­
nanciers discovered this, the uncle would be fired. Weil apologized for get­
ting hirn in this mess, but he had a plan : He knew the other boxer well, and 
with a little bribe, they could fix the fight. But where would the money 
come from for the bet? the uncle replie d. Without it they were as good as 
dead. Finally Geezil had heard enough. Unwilling to jeop ardize his deal 
with any ill will, he offered his own $35,000 cash for part of the bet. Even if 
he lost that, he would wire for more money and still make a profit on the 
sale of the lodge. The uncle and nephew thanked hirn. With their own 
$15,000 and Geezil's 1$35,000 they would manage to have enough for the 
bet. That evening, as Geezil watched the two boxers rehearse the fix in 
the hotel room, his mind reeled at the killing he was going to make from both 
the boxing match and the sale of the lodge. 
The fight took place in a gym the next day. Weil handled the cash, 
which was placed for security in a locked box. Everything was pro­
ceeding as planned in the hotel room. The financiers were looking glum at 
how badly their fighter was doing, and Geezil was dreaming about the easy 
money he was about to make . Then, suddenly, a wild swing by the fi­
nanc ier's fighter hit Gross hard in the face, knocking hirn down. When he 
hit the canvas, blood spurted from his mouth. He coughed, then lay still. 
One of the financiers, a former doctor, checked his pulse; he was dead. The 
millionaires panicked: Everyone had to get out before the police arrived­
they could all be charged with murder. 
Terrified, Geezil hightailed it out of the gym and back to Chicago, leav­
ing behind his $35,000 which he was only too glad to forget, for it seemed 
a small price to pay to avoid being implicated in a crime. He never wanted 
to see Weil or any of the others again. 
After Geezil scurried out, Gross stood up, under his own steam. The 
blood that had spurted from his mouth came from a ball filled with chicken 
blood and hot water that he had hidden in his cheek. The whole affair had 
been masterminded by Weil, better known as "the Yellow Kid," one of the 
most creative con artists in history. Weil split the $35,000 with the fi­
nanciers and the boxers (all fellow con artists)-a nice little profit for a few 
days' work. SI\E.�K AC ROSS 'j'1 Jf:

The Yellow Kid had staked out Geezil as the perfect sucker long before he 
set up the con. He knew the boxing-match scam would be the perfect ruse 
to separate Geezil from his money quickly and definitively. But he also 
knew that if he had begun by trying to interest Geezil in the boxing match, 
he would have failed miserably. He had to conceal his intentions and 
switch attention, create a smoke screen-in this case the sale of the lodge. 
On the train ride and in the hotel room Geezil's mind had been com­
pletely occupied with the pending deal, the easy money, the chance to 
hobnob with wealthy men. He had failed to notice that Gross was out of 
shape and middle-aged at best. Such is the distracting power of a smoke 
screen. Engrossed in the business deal, Geezil's attention was easily di­
verted to the boxing match, but only at a point when it was already too late 
for hirn to notice the details that would have given Gross away. The match, 
after all, now depended on a bribe rather than on the boxer's physical condi­
tion. And Geezil was so distracted at the end by the illusion of the boxer's death 
that he completely forgot about his money. 
Learn from the Yellow Kid: The familiar, inconspicuous front is the 
perfect smoke screen. Approach your mark with an idea that seems ordi­
nary enough-a business deal, financial intrigue. The sucker's mind is dis­
tracted, his suspicions allayed. That is when you gently guide hirn onto the 
second path, the slippery slope down which he slides helplessly into your 
trap. 
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 11 
In the mid-1920s, the powerful warlords of Ethiopia were coming to the re­
alization that a young man of the nobility named Haile Selassie, also 
known as Ras Tafari, was outcompeting them all and nearing the point 
where he could prodaim hirnself their leader, unifying the country for the 
first time in decades. Most of his rivals could not understand how this 
wispy, , quiet, mild-mannered man had been able to take control. Yet in 
LAW 3 25 
26 LAW 3 1927, Selassie was able to summon the warlords, one at a time, to come to 
Addis Ababa to declare their loyalty and recognize bim as leader. 
Some hurried, some hesitated, but only one, Dejazmach Balcha of 
Sidamo, dared defy Selassie totally. A blustery man, Balcha was a great 
warrior, and he considered the new leader weak and unworthy. He point­
edly stayed away from the capital. Finally Selassie, in his gentle but stern 
way, commanded Balcha to come. The warlord decided to obey, but in 
doing so he would turn the tables on this pretender to the Ethiopian 
throne: He would come to Addis Ababa at his own speed, and with an 
army of 10,000 men, a force large enough to defend hirnself, perhaps even 
start a civil war. Stationing this formidable force in a valley three rniles 
from the capital, he waited, as a king would. Selassie would have to come 
to bim. 
Selassie did indeed send emissaries, asking Balcha to attend an after­
noon banquet in his honor. But Balcha, no fool, knew history-he knew 
that previous kings and lords of Ethiopia had used banquets as a trap. 
Once he was there and full of drink, Selassie would have hirn arrested or 
murdered. To signal his understanding of the situation, he agreed to come 
to the banquet, but only if he could bring his personal bodyguard-600 of 
bis best soldiers, all armed and ready to defend hirn and themselves. To 
Balcha's surprise, Selassie answered with the utmost politeness that he 
would be honored to play host to such warriors. 
On the way to the banquet, Balcha warned his soldiers not to get 
drunk and to be on their guard. When they arrived at the palace, Selassie 
was his charrning best. He deferred to Balcha, treated hirn as if he desper­
ately needed his approval and cooperation. But Balcha refused to be 
charmed, and he warned Selassie that if he did not return to his camp by 
nightfall, his army had orders to attack the capital. Selassie reacted as if 
hurt by his mistrust. Over the meal, when it came time for the traditional 
singing of songs in honor of Ethiopia' s leaders, he made a point of allowing 
only songs honoring the warlord of Sidamo. It seemed to Balcha that Se­
lassie was scared, intimidated by this great warrior who could not be out­
witted. Sensing the change, Balcha believed that he would be the one to 
call the shots in the days to come. 
At the end of the afternoon, Balcha and his soldiers began their march 
back to camp arnidst cheers and gun salutes. Looking back to the capital 
over his shoulder, he planned his strategy-how his own soldiers would 
march through the capital in triumph within weeks, and Selassie would be 
put in his place, his place being either prison or death. When Balcha came 
in sight of bis camp, however, he saw that something was terribly wrong. 
Where before there had been colorful tents stretching as far as the eye 
could see, now there was nothing, only smoke from doused fires. What 
devil's magie was this? 
A witness told Balcha what had happened. During the banquet, a large 
army, commanded by an ally of Selassie's, had stolen up on Balcha's en­
campment by a side route he had not seen. This army had not come to 
fight, however: Knowing that Balcha would}lave heard a noisy battle and 
/ 
hurried back with his 600-man bodyguard, Selassie had ,armed his own 
troops with baskets of gold and cash. They had sUITou nded Balcha' s army 
and proceeded to purchase every last one of their weapons. Those who re­
fused were easily intimidated. Within a few hours, Balcha's entire force had 
been disarmed and scattered in all directions. 
Realizing his danger, Balcha decided to march south with his 600 sol­
diers to regroup, but the same army that had disarmed his soldiers blocked 
his way. The other way out was to march on the capital, but Selas sie had set 
a large army to defend it. Like a chess player, he had predicted Balcha's 
moves, and had checkrnated hirn. For the first time in his life, Balcha sur­
rendered. To repent his sins of pride and ambition, he agreed to enter a 
monastery. 
Interpretation 
Throug hout Selass ie's long reign, no one could quite figure hirn out. 
Ethiopians like their leaders fierce, but Selassie, who wore the front of a 
gentle, peace-loving man, lasted longer than any of them. Never angry or 
impatient, he lured his victims with sweet smiles, lulling them with charm 
and obsequi ousness before he attac ked. In the case of Balcha, Selassie 
played on the man's warine ss, his suspicion that the banquet was a trap-­
which in fact it was, but not the one he expected. Selassie's way of allaying 
Balcha' s fears-letting him bring his bodyguard to the banquet, giving hirn 
top billing there, making him feel in control--created a thick smoke screen, 
concealing the real action three miles away. 
Rem ember: The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to deceive. 
Win their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that blinds their 
view in another, letting you creep up and level them with a devastating 
blow. A helpful or apparently honest ge sture, or one that implies the other 
person's superiority- these are perfect diversionary devices. 
Properly set up, the smoke screen is a weapon of great power. It en­
abled the gentle Selassie to totally destroy his enemy, without firing a single 
bullet. 
Do not underestimate the power of Tafari. He creeps 
like a mouse hut he has jaws like a lion.

KEYS TO POWER 
If you believe that deceivers are colorful folk who mislead with elaborate 
lies and tall ta les, you are greatly mistaken. The best deceivers utilize a 
bland and inconspicuous front that calls no attention to themsel ves. They 
know that extravagant words and ge stures immediately raise suspicion. In­
stead, they envelop their mark in the familiar, the banal, the harmless. In 
Yellow Kid Weil's dealings with Sam Geezil, the familiar was a business 
deal. In the Ethiopian case, it was Selass ie's misleading obsequiousness­
exactly what -Balcha would have expected from a weaker warlord. 
LAW 3 27 
28 LAW 3 Once you have lulled your suckers' atte ntion with the familiar, they 
will not notice the deception being perpetrated behind their backs. This 
derives from a simple truth : people can only focus on one thing at a time. It 
is really too difficult for them to imagine that the bland and harmless per­
son they are dealing with is simulta neously setting up something else. The 
grayer and more uniform the smoke in your smoke screen, the better it 
conceals your intent ions. In the decoy and red herring devices discussed in 
Part I, you actively distract people; in the smoke screen, you lull your vic­
tims, drawing them into your web. Because it is so hypnotic, this is often 
the best way of concea ling your intent ions. 
The simplest form of smoke screen is facial expression. Behind abland, 
unreadable exte rior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned, without detection. 
This is a weapon that the most powerful men in history have learned to per­
fect. It was said that no one could read Franklin D. Roosevelt's face. Baron 
James Rothschild made a lifelong practice of disguising his real thoughts be­
hind bland smiles and nondescript looks. Stendhal wrote of Talleyrand, 
"Never was a face less of a barometer. " Henry Kissinger would bore his op­
ponents around the negotiating table to tears with his monotonous voice, 
his blank look, his endless recitations of detai ls; then, as their eyes glazed 
over, he would suddenly hit them with a list of bold terms. Caught off­
guard, they would be easily intimida ted. As one poker manual explains it, 
"W hile playing his hand, the good player is seldom an actor. Instead he 
practices abland behavior that minimizes readable patterns, frustrates and 
confuses opponents, permits greater concent rati on." 
An adaptable concept, the smoke screen can be pract iced on a num­
ber of levels, all playing on the psychological principles of distraction and 
misdirection. One of the most effective smoke screens is the noble gesture. 
People want to believe apparently noble gestures are genuin e, for the belief 
is pleasant. They rarely notice how deceptive these gestures can be. 
The art dealer Joseph Duveen was once confront ed with a terrible prob­
lem. The millionaires who had paid so dearly for Duveen's paintings were 
running out of wall space, and with inheritance taxes getting ever higher, it 
seemed unlikely that they would keep buying. The solution was the Nati onal 
Gallery of Art in Wa shington, D.C., which Duveen helped create in 1937 by 
getting An drew Mellon to donate his collection to it. The National Gallery 
was the perfect front for Duveen. In one gesture, his clients avoided taxes, 
cleared wall space for new purchas es, and reduced the number of paintings 
on the market, maintaining the upward pressure on their prices. All this 
while the donors created the appearance of being public benef actors. 
An other effective smoke screen is the pattern, the establishment of a se­
ries of actions that seduce the victim into believing you will continue in the 
same way. The pattern plays on the psychology of antic ipation: Our behav­
ior conforms to patterns, or so we like to think. 
In 1878 the Am erican robber baronJay Gould created a company that 
began to threaten the monopoly of the telegraph company We stern Union. 
The directors of We stern Union decided to buy Gould's company up-
they had to spend a hefty sum, but they figured they had managed to rid 
themselves of an irritating competitor. A few months later, though, Gould 
was it at again, complaining he had been treated unfairly. He started up a 
second company to compete with Western Union and its new acquisition. 
The same thing happened again: Western Union bought hirn out to shut 
hirn up. Soon the pattern began for the third time, but now Gould went for 
the jugular: He suddenly staged a bloody takeover struggle and managed 
to gain complete control of Western Union. He had established a pattern 
that had tricked the company' s directors into thinking his goal was to be 
bought out at a handsome rate. Once they paid hirn off, they relaxed and 
failed to notice that he was actually playing for higher stake s. The pattern is 
powerful in that it deceives the other person into expecting the opposite of 
what you are really doing. 
Another psychological weak ness on which to construct a smoke screen 
is the tendency to mistake appearances for reality-the feeling that if some­
one seems to belong to your group, their belonging must be real. This habit 
makes the seamless blend a very effective front. The trick is simple: You sim­
ply blend in with those around you. The better you blend, the less suspi­
cious you become. During the Cold War of the 1950s and '60s, as is now 
notorious, a slew of British civil servants passed secrets to the Soviets. They 
went undetected for years because they were apparently decent chaps, had 
gone to all the right schools, and fit the old-boy network perfectly. Blend­
ing in is the perfect smoke screen for spying. The better you do it, the bet­
ter you can conceal your intentions. 
Rememb er: It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant colors, 
to put on the mask of the inconspicu ous. Do not despair at having to wear 
such abland mask-it is often your unreadability that draws people to you 
and makes you appear a person of power.

Authority: Have you ever heard of a skillful general, who intends to 
surprise a citadel, announcing his plan to his enemy? Conceal your 
purpose and hide your progress; do not disclose the extent of your 
designs until they cannot be opposed, until the combat is over. Win 
the victory before you declare the war. In a word, imitate those war­
like people whose designs are not known except by the ravaged coun­
try through which they have passed. (Ninon de Lenclos, 1623-1706)

No smoke screen , red herr ing, fals e sincerity, or any other diver sionar y de­

As P. T. Barnu m , the nineteenth- centur y king of humbugger y, grew 
older , he learn ed to embra c e his reputation as a grand deceiver. At one

and a few imported buffalo. He publi cized the hunt as genuine , but it came 
off as so complet ely fake that the crowd , instead of getting angry and ask­

tricks all the time; that was the secret of his success, and they loved him for 
it. Learn ing a lesson from this affa ir, Barn um stopped concealing all of his 
devi ces, even revealing his deception s in a tell-all autobiograph y. As 
Kierkegaard wrote , "The world want s to be deceived." 
Finall y, although it is wiser to divert attention from your purpo ses by 
presenting abland , familiar exterior , there are time s when the colorfu l,

mountebank s of seventeenth -and eighteenth- centur y Europe used humor

horses. Clo wns, tightrope walker s, and star entertainer s would accompan y 
him , pulling people in to his demon stration s of elixir s and quac k poti ons . 
The charlatan made enterta inment seem like the business of the day ; the 
business of the day was actuall y the sale of the elixir s and quac k potion s. 
Spe ctacle and entertainment , clearly, are excellent devi ces to conceal 
your intention s, but they cannot be used inde finitely. The publi c grow s 
tired and suspicious, and eventuall y catches on to the trick. And indeed the 
charlatan s had to move quickl y from town to town , before word spread

throughout their lifetime s . Their act never wea rs thin , and rarel y causes

Gnaeus Marcius, also known as Coriolanus, was a great military hero of 
ancient Rome. In the first half of the fifth century B.C. he won many impor­
tant batt les, saving the city from calamity time and time again. Because he 
spent most ofhis time on the battlefield, few Romans knew him persona lly, 
making him something of a legendary figure . 
In 454 B.C., Coriolanus decided it was time to exploit his reputation 
and enter politics. He stood for election to the high rank of consul . Candi­
dates for this position traditionally made a public address early in the race, 
and when Coriolanus came before the people, he began by displaying the 
dozens of scars he had accumulated over seventeen years of fighting for 
Rome. Few in the crowd really heard the lengthy speech that followed; 
those scars, proof of his valor and patriot ism, moved the people to tears . 
Coriolan us's election seemed certain . 
When the polling day arriv ed, however, Coriolanus made an entry 
into the forum escorted by the entire senate and by the city's patricians, the 
aristocracy. The common people who saw this were disturbed by such a 
blustering show of confidence on election day. 
And then Coriolanus spoke again, mostly addressing the wealthy citi­
zens who had accompanied him. His words were arrogant and insolent. 
Claiming certain victory in the vote, he boasted of his battlefield exploits, 
made sour jokes that appealed only to the patrici ans, voiced angry accusa­
tions against his opponents, and speculated on the riches he would bring to 
Rome. This time the people listene d: They had not realized that this leg­
endary soldier was also a common braggart. 
News of Coriolan us's second speech spread quickly through Rome, 
and the people turned out in great numb ers to make sure he was not 
elected. Defeate d, Coriolanus returned to the battl efield, bitter and vowing 
revenge on the common folk who had voted against him. Same weeks later 
a large shipment of grain arrived in Rome. The senate was ready to distrib­
ute this food to the people, for free, but just as they were prepa ring to vote 
on the question Coriolanus appeared on the scene and took the senate 
floor. The distributi on, he argu ed, would have a harmful effe ct on the city 
as a whole. Several senators appeared won over, and the vote on the distri­
bution fell into doubt. Coriolanus did not stop there : He went on to con­
demn the concept of democracy itself. He advo cated getting rid of the 
people's represe ntatives-the tribunes-and turning over the governing of 
the city to the patricians. 
Wh en word of Coriolan us's latest speech reache d the people, their 
anger knew no bounds. The trib unes were sent to the senate to demand 
that Coriolanus appear before them. He refused. Riots broke out all over 
the city. The senate, fearing the people's wrath, finally voted in favor of the 
grain distribut ion. The tribunes were appeased, but the people still de­
mande d that Coriolanus speak to them and apologi ze. If he repented, and 
agreed to keep his opinions to himself , he would be allowed to return to 
the batt lefield. 
Coriolanus did appear one last time before the people, who listened to 
hirn in rapt silence. He started slowly and softly, but as the speech went on, 
he became more and more blunt. Yet again he hurled insults ! His tone was 
arrogant, his expression disdai nful. The more he spoke, the angrier the 
people became. Finally they shouted hirn down and silenced hirn. 
The tribunes conferred, condemned Coriolanus to death, and ordered 
the magistrates to take hirn at once to the top of the Tarpeian rock and 
throw hirn over. The delighted crowd seconded the decision. The patri­
cians, however, managed to intervene, and the sentence was commuted to 
a lifelong banishment. When the people found ou t that Rome's great mili­
tary hero would never return to the city, they celebrated in the streets. In 
fact no one had ever seen such a celebration, not even after the defeat of a 
foreign enemy. 
Interpretation 
Before his entrance into politics, the name of Coriolanus evoked awe. 
His battl efield accomplishments showed hirn as a man of great brav­
ery. Since the citizens knew little about hirn, all kinds of legends became at­
tached to his name. The moment he appeared before the Roman citizens, 
however, and spoke his mind, all that grandeur and mystery vanished. He 
bragged and blustered like a common soldier. He insulted and slandered 
people, as if he felt threatened and insecure. Suddenly he was not at all 
what the people had imagi ned. The discrepancy between the legend and 
the reality proved immensely disappo inting to those who wanted to be­
lieve in their hero. The more Coriolanus said, the less powerful he ap­
peared-a person who cannot control his words shows that he cannot 
control hirnse lf, and is unworthy of respect. 
Had Coriolanus said less, the people would never have had cause to 
be offended by hirn, would never have known his true feelings. He would 
have mainta ined his powerful aura, would certainly have been elected con­
sul, and would have been able to accomplish his antidemocratic goals. But 
the human tongue is a beast that few can master. It strains constantly to 
break out of its cage, and if it is not tamed, it will run wild and cause you 
grief. Power cannot accrue to those who squander their treasure of words. 
Oysters open completely when the moon is JuZZ; and when the crab sees one

again so that it serves the crab Jor meat. Such is the Jate oJ him who opens

34 LAW 4 everyone would argue some more: How should the issues be phrased? 
What would appeal to Louis, what would annoy him? At what time of day 
should the representatives approach him, and in what part of the Versailles 
palace? What expression should they have on their faces? 
Finally, after all this was settled, the fatend moment would finally ar­
rive. The two men would approach Louis-always a delicate matter-and 
when they finally had his ear, they would talk about the issue at hand, 
spelling out the options in detail. 
Louis would listen in silence, a most enigmatic look on his face. Fi­
nally, when each had finished his presentation and had asked for the king's 
opinion, he would look at them both and say, "I shall see." Then he would 
walk away. 
The ministers and courtiers would never hear another word on this 
subject from the king-they would simply see the result, weeks later, when 
he would come to adecision and act. He would never bother to consult 
them on the matter again. 
Interpretation 
Louis XIV was a man of very few words. His most famous remark is 
"L'Uat, c'est moi" ("I am the state"); nothing could be more pithy yet more 
eloquent. His infamous "I shall see" was one of several extremely short 
phrases that he would apply to all manner of requests. 
Louis was not always this way; as a young man he was known for talk­
ing at length, delighting in his own eloquence. His later tacitumity was self­
imposed, an act, a mask he used to keep everybody below him off-balance. 
No one knew exactly where he stood, or could predict bis reactions. No 
one could try to deceive him by saying what they thought he wanted to 
hear, because no one knew what he wanted to hear. As they talked on and 
on to the silent Louis, they revealed more and more about themselves, in­
formation he would later use against them to great effect. 
In the end, Louis's silence kept those around him terrified and under 
his thumb. It was one of the foundations of his power. As Saint-Simon 
wrote, "No one knew as weIl as he how to seIl his words, his smile, even his 
glances. Everything in him was valuable because he created differences, 
and his majesty was enhanced by the sparseness ofhis words." 
It is even more damaging for a minister to say foolish things than to do them. 
Cardinal de Retz, 1613-1679 
KEYS TO POWER 
Power is in many ways agame of appearances, and when you say less than 
necessary, you inevitably appear greater and more powerful than you are. 
YOUf silence will make other people uncomfortable. Humans are machines 
of interpretation and explanation; they have to know what you are think­
ing. When you carefully control what you reveal, they cannot pierce yOUf 
intentions or your meaning. 
YOUf short answers and silences will put them on the defensive, and 
they will jump in, nervously filling the silence with all kinds of comments 
that will reveal valuable information about them and their weaknesses. 
They will leave a meeting with you feeling as if they had been robbed, and 
they will go horne and ponder YOUf every word. This extra attention to 
YOUf brief comments will only add to your power. 
Saying less than necessary is not for kings and statesmen only. In most 
areas of life, the less you say, the more profound and mysterious you ap­
pear. As a young man, the artist Andy Warhol had the revelation that it was 
generally impossible to get people to do what you wanted them to do by 
talking to them. They would turn against you, subvert YOUf wishes, disobey 
you out of sheer perversity. He once told a friend, "I leamed that you actu­
ally have more power when you shut up." 
In his later life Warhol employed this strategy with great success. His 
interviews were exercises in oracular speech: He would say something 
vague and ambiguous, and the interviewer would twist in circles trying to 
figure it out, imagining there was something prafound behind his often 
meaningless phrases. Warhol rarely talked ab out his work; he let others do 
the interpreting. He claimed to have leamed this technique from that mas­
ter of enigma Marcel Duchamp, another twentieth-century artist who real­
ized early on that the less he said about his work, the more people talked 
about it. And the more they talked, the more valuable his work became. 
By saying less than necessary you create the appearance of meaning 
and power. Also, the less you say, the less risk you run of saying something 
foolish, even dangerau s. In 1825 a new czar, Nicholas I, ascended the 
throne of Russia. Arebellion immediately broke out, led by liberals de­
manding that the country moderniz e-that its industries and civil struc­
tures catch up with the rest of Europe. Brutally crushing this rebellion (the 
Decembrist Uprising) , Nicholas I sentenced one of its leaders, Kondraty 
Ryleyev, to death. On the day of the execution Ryleyev stood on the gal­
lows, the noose around his neck. The trapdoor opened-but as Ryleyev 
dangled, the rape brake, dashing hirn to the ground. At the time, events 
like this were considered signs of providence or heavenly will, and a man 
saved from execution this way was usually pardoned. As Ryleyev got to his 
feet, bruised and dirtied but believing his neck had been saved, he called 
out to the crowd, "You see, in Russia they don't know how to do anything 
properly, not even how to make rape!" 
A messenger immediately went to the Winter Palace with news of the 
failed hanging. Vexed by this disappointing turnabout, Nicholas I never­
theless began to sign the pardon. But then: "Did Ryleyev say anything after 
this miracle?" the czar asked the messenger. "Sire," the messenger replied, 
"he said that in Russia they don't even know how to make rope." 
"In that case," said the Czar, "let us prove the contrary," and he tore 
up the pardon. The next day Ryleyev was hanged again. This time the 
rope did not break. 
Learn the lesson: Once the words are out, you cannot take them back. 
Keep them under control. Be particularly careful with sarcasm: The mo-

the price you pay.

Authority: Never start moving your own lips and teeth before

can thereby understand their real intentions .... If the sovereign

REVERS AL 
There are times when it is unwise to be silent. Silence can arouse suspicion 
and even insecurity, espec ially in your superi ors; a vague or ambig uous 
comment can open you up to interpretations you had not barga ined for. Si­
lence and saying less than necessary must be practiced with cauti on, then, 
and in the right situat ions. It is occasionally wiser to imitate the court jester, 
who plays the fool but knows he is smarter than the king. He talks and talks 
and entertains, and no one suspects that he is more than just a foo1. 
Also, words can sometimes act as a kind of smoke screen for any de­
ception you might pract ice. By bending your listener' s ear with talk, you 
can distract and mesmerize them; the more you talk, in fact, the less suspi­
cious of you they become. The verbose are not perceived as sly and ma­
nipulative but as helpless and unsophisticate d. This is the reverse of the 
silent policy employed by the powerful : By talking more, and making 
yourself appear weaker and less intelligent than your mark, you can prac­
tice deception with greater ease.

During China's War of the Three Kingdoms (A,D, 207-265), the great gen­
eral Chuko Liang, leading the forces of the Shu Kingdom, dispatched his 
vast army to a distant camp while he rested in a small town with a handful 
of soldiers, Suddenly sentineIs hurried in with the alarming news that an 
enemy force of over 150,000 troops under Sima Yi was approaching, With 
only a hundred men to defend hirn, Chuko Liang's situation was hopeless, 
The enemy would finally capture this renowned leader, 
Without lamenting his fate, or wasting time trying to figure out how he 
had been caught, Liang ordered his troops to take down their flags, throw 
open the eity gates, and hide, He hirnself then took a seat on the most visi­
ble part of the city's wall, wearing a Taoist robe. He lit some incense, 
strummed his lute, and began to chant. Minutes later he could see the vast 
enemy army approaching, an endless phalanx of soldiers. Pretending not 
to notice them, he continued to sing and play the lute. 
Soon the army stood at the town gates, At its head was Sima Yi, who 
instantly recognized the man on the wall. 
Even so, as his soldiers itched to enter the unguarded town through its 
open gates, Sima Yi hesitated, held them back, and studied Liang on the 
wall. Then, he ordered an immediate and speedy retreat. 
Interpretation 
Chuko Liang was commonly known as the "Sleeping Dragon." His ex­
ploits in the War of the Three Kingdoms were legendary. Once a man 
daiming to be a disaffected enemy lieutenant came to his camp, offering 
help and information. Liang instantly recognized the situation as a setup; 
this man was a false deserter, and should be beheaded. At the last minute, 
though, as the ax was about to fall, Liang stopped the execution and of­
fered to spare the man's life if he agreed to become a double agent. Grate­
ful and terrified, the man agreed, and began supplying false information to 
the enemy. Liang won battle after battle. 
On another occasion Liang stole a military seal and created false docu­
ments dispatching his enemy's troops to distant locations. Once the troops 
had dispersed, he was able to capture three eities, so that he controlled an 
entire corridor of the enemy's kingdom. He also once tricked the enemy 
into believing one of its best generals was a traitor, forcing the man to es­
cape and join forces with Liang. The Sleeping Dragon carefully cultivated 
his reputation of being the deverest man in China, one who always had a 
trick up his sleeve. As powerful- as any weapon, this reputation struck fear 
into his enemy. 
Sima Yi had fought against Chuko Liang dozens of times and knew 
hirn weIl. When he came on the empty city, with Liang praying on the 
wall, he was stunned. The Taoist robes, the chanting, the incense--this had 
to be agame of intimidat ion. The man was obviously taunting hirn, daring 
hirn to walk into a trap. The game was so obvious that for one moment it 
crossed Yi's mind that Liang actually was alone, and desperate . But so 
great was his fear of Liang that he dared not risk finding out. Such is the 
power of reputation. It can put a vast army on the defensive, even force 
them into retreat, without a single arrow being fired. 
FoT, as Cicero says, even those who argue against fame still want the books they 
write against it to bear their name in the title and hope to become famous for 
despising it. Everything else is subject to barter: we will let our Jriends have 
our goods and our lives if need be; but a case of sharing our fame and 
making someone else the gift of our reputation is hardly to be found. 
Mont aigne, 1533-1592 
OBSER VA NCE OF THE LAW II 
In 1841 the young P. T. Barnum, trying to establish his reputation as Amer­
ica's premier showman, decided to purchase the American Museum in 
Manhattan and turn it into a collection of curiosities that would secure his 
farne. The problem was that he had no money. The museum's asking price 
was $15,000, but Barnum was able to put together a proposal that appealed 
to the institution's owners even though it replaced cash up front with 
dozens of guarantees and references. The owners came to a verbal agree­
ment with Barnum, but at the last minute, the principal partner changed 
his mind, and the museum and its collection were sold to the directors of 
Peale's Museum. Barnum was infuriated, but the partner explained that 
business was business-the museum had been sold to Peale's because 
Peale's had areputation and Barnum had none. 
Barnum immediately decided that if he had no reputation to bank on, 
his only recourse was to ruin the reputation of Peale's. Accordingly he 
launched a letter-writing campaign in the newspapers, calling the owners a 
bunch of "broken-down bank directors" who had no idea how to run a mu­
seum or entertain people. He warned the public against buying Peale's 
stock, since the business's purchase of another museum would invariably 
spread its resources thin. The campaign was effective, the stock plum­
meted, and with no more confidence in Peale's track record and reputa­
tion, the owners of the American Museum reneged on their deal and sold 
the whole thing to Barnum. 
It took years for Peale's to recover, and they never forgot what Bar­
num had done. Mr. Peale hirnself decided to attack Barnum by building a 
reputation for "high-brow entertainment," promoting his museu m's pro­
grams as more scientific than those of his vulgar competitor. Mesmerism 
(hypnotism) was one of Peale's "scientific" attractions, and for a while it 
drew big crowds and was quite successful. To fight back, Barnum decided 
to attack Peale's reputation yet again. 
Barnum organized a riyal mesmeric performance in which he hirnself 
apparently put a little girl into a trance. Once she seemed to have fallen 
deeply under, he tried to hypnotize members of the audience--but no mat­
ter how hard he tried, none of the spectators fell under his speIl, and many 
of them began to laugh. A frustrated Barnum finally announced that to 
prove the little girl's trance was real, he would cut off one of her fingers many a sheep

40 LAW 5 without her noticing. But as he sharpened the knife, the little girl's eyes 
popped open and she ran away, to the audienee's delight. He repeated this 
and other parodies for several weeks. Soon no one eould take Peale's show 
seriously, and attendanee went way down. Within a few weeks, the show 
dosed. Over the next few years Barnum established areputation for audae­
ity and eonsummate showmanship that lasted his whole life. Peale's reputa­
tion, on the other hand, never reeovered. 
Interpretation 
Barnum used two different taeties to ruin Peale's reputation. The first was 
simple: He sowed doubts about the museum 's stability and solveney. 
Doubt is a powerful weapon: Onee you let it out of the bag with insidious 
rumors, YOUf opponents are in a horrible dilemma. On the one hand they 
ean deny the rumors, even prove that you have slandered them. But a 
layer of suspieion will remain: Why are they defending themselves so des­
perately? Maybe the rumor has some truth to it? If, on the other hand, they 
take the high road and ignore you, the doubts, unrefuted, will be even 
stronger. If done eorreetly, the sowing of rumors ean so infuriate and unset­
tle YOUf rivals that in defending themselve s they will make numerous mis­
takes. This is the perfeet weapon for those who have no reputation of their 
own to work from. 
Onee Barnum did have a reputation of his own, he used the seeond, 
gentler taetie, the fake hypnotism demonstration: He ridieuled his rivals' 
reputatio n. This too was extremely sueeessful. Onee you have a solid base 
of respeet, ridieuling YOUf opponent both puts hirn on the defensive and 
draws more attention to you, enhancing your own reputation. Outright 
slander and insult are too strong at this point; they are ugly, and may hurt 
you more than help you. But gentle barbs and moekery suggest that you 
have a strong enough sense of your own worth to enjoy a good laugh at 
your rival's expense. A humorous front ean make you out as a harmless en­
tertainer while poking holes in the reputation of YOUf rival. 
It is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad reputation. 
Friedrich Nietzsehe, 1844-1900 
KEYS TO PO WE R 
The people around us, even OUf dosest friends, will always to some extent 
remain mysterious and unfathomable. Their eharaeters have seeret reeesses 
that they never reveal. The unknowabl eness of other people eould prove 
disturbing if we thought about it long enough, sinee it would make it im­
possible for us really to judge other people. So we prefer to ignore this fact, 
and to judge people on their appearanees, on what is most visible to OUf 
eyes-clot hes, gestures, words, aetions. In the social realm, appearanees are 
the barometer of almost all of OUf judgments, and you must never be mis­
led into believing otherwise. One false slip, one awkward or sudden change 
in YOUf appearanee, ean prove disastrous. 
This is the reason for the supreme importan ce of making and main­
taining areputation that is of your own creation. 
That reputation will protect you in the dangerous game of appear­
ances, distracting the probing eyes of others from knowing what you are 
really like, and giving you a degree of control over how the world judges 
you-a powerful position to be in. Reputation has apower like magic: 
With one stroke of its wand, it can double your strength. It can also send 
people scurrying away from you. Whether the exact same deeds appear 
brilliant or dreadful can depend entirely on the reputation of the doer. 
In the aneient Chinese court of the Wei kingdom there was a man 
named Mi Tzu-hsia who had areputation for supreme eivility and graeious­
ness. He became the mler's favorite. It was a law in Wei that "whoever 
rides secretly in the mler's coach shall have his feet cut off," but when Mi 
Tzu-hsia's mother fell ill, he used the royal coach to visit her, pretending 
that the mler had given hirn permission. When the mler found out, he said, 
"How dutiful is Mi Tzu-hsia! For his mother's sake he even forgot that he 
was committing a crime making hirn liable to lose his feet!" 
Another time the two of them took a stroll in an orchard. Mi Tzu-hsia 
began eating a peach that he could not finish, and he gave the mler the 
other half to eat. The mler remarked, "You love me so much that you would 
even forget your own saliva taste and let me eat the rest of the peach!" 
Later, however, envious fellow courtiers, spreading word that Mi Tzu­
hsia was actually devious and arrogant, succeeded in damaging his reputa­
tion; the mler came to see his actions in a new light. "This fellow once rode 
in my coach under pretense of my order," he told the courtiers angrily, 
"and another time he gave me a half-eaten peach." For the same actions 
that had charmed the mler when he was the favorite, Mi Tzu-hsia now had 
to suffer the penalties. The fate of his feet depended solelyon the strength 
of his reputation. 
In the beginning, you must work to establish areputation for one out­
standing quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning. This quality 
sets you apart and gets other people to talk ab out you. You then make your 
reputation known to as many people as possible (subtly, though; take care 
to build slowly, and with a firm foundation), and watch as it spreads like 
wildfire. 
A solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your 
strengths without your having to spend much energy. It can also create an 
aura around you that will instill respect, even fear. In the fighting in the 
North Af rican desert during World War II, the German general Erwin 
Rommel had areputation for cunning and for deceptive maneuvering that 
struck terror into everyone who faced hirn. Even when his forces were de­
pleted, and when British tanks outnumbered his by five to one, entire eities 
would be evacuated at the news of his approach. 
As they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you, and if it inspires 
respect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive on the scene, 
or utter a single word. 
Your success seems destined by your past triumphs. Much of the suc-
LAW 5 41 
42 LAW 5 cess of Henry Kissinger' s shuttle diplomacy rested on bis reputation for 
ironing out differences; no one wanted to be seen as so unreasonable that 
Kissinger could not sway hirn. A peace treaty seemed a fait accompli as 
soon as Kissinger's name became involved in the negotia tions. 
Make your reputation simple and base it on one sterling quality. This 
single quality--e fficiency, say, or seductiveness- becomes a kind of calling 
card that announces your presence and places others under aspeIl. A repu­
tation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of deception. 
Casanova used bis reputation as a great seducer to pave the way for his fu­
ture conquests; women who had heard of his powers became immensely 
curious, and wanted to discover for themselve s what had made hirn so ro­
mantically successful. 
Perhaps you have already stained your reputation, so that you are pre­
vented from establishing a new one. In such cases it is wise to associate 
with someone whose image counteracts your own, using their good name 
to whitewash and elevate yours. It is hard, for example, to erase a reputa­
tion for dishonesty by yourself; but a paragon of honesty can help. When 
P. T. Barnum wanted to dean up areputation for promoting vulgar enter­
tainment, he brought the singer Jenny Lind over from Europe. She had a 
stellar, high-dass reputation, and the American tour Bamum sponsored for 
her greatly enhanced his own image. Similarly the great robber barons of 
nineteenth-c entury America were long unable to rid themselves of a repu­
tation for cruelty and mean-spirite dness. Only when they began collecting 
art, so that the names of Morgan and Frick became permanently associated 
with those of da Vinci and Rembrandt, were they able to soften their un­
pleasant image. 
Reputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded. Espe­
cially when you are first establishing it, you must protect it strictly, antici­
pating all attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or 
defensive at the slanderous comments of your enemies- that reveals inse­
curity, not confidence in your reputation. Take the high road instead, and 
never appear desperate in your self-defense. On the other hand, an attack 
on another man's reputation is a potent weapon, particularly when you 
have less power than he does. He has much more to lose in such a battle, 
and your own thus-far-small reputation gives hirn a small target when he 
tries to return your fire. Bamum used such campaigns to great effect in his 
early career. But this tactic must be practiced with skill; you must not seem 
to engage in petty vengeance. If you do not break your enemy's reputation 
deverly, you will inadvertently ruin your own. 
Thomas Edison, considered the inventor who hamessed electricity, 
believed that a workable system would have to be based on direct cur­
rent (DC). When the Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla appeared to have suc­
ceeded in creating a system based on alternating current (AC), Edison was 
furious. He determined to ruin Tesla's reputation, by making the public be­
lieve that the AC system was inherently unsafe, and Tesla irresponsible in 
promoting it. 
To this end he captured all kinds of household pets and electrocuted 
them to death with an AC current. When this wasn't enough, in 1890 he got 
New York State prison auth orities to organize the world's first execution by 
electrocuti on, using an AC current. Eut Edison's electrocution experiments 
had all been with small creat ures; the charge was too weak, and the man 
was only half killed. In perhaps the country's cruelest stat e-authoriz ed exe­
cution, the procedure had to be repeated. It was an awful specta cle. 
Although, in the long run, it is Edison's name that has survived, at the 
time his campaign damaged his own reputati on more than Tesla's. He 
backed off. The lesson is simple-never go too far in attacks like these, for 
that will draw more attention to your own vengefulness than to the person 
you are slandering. When your own reputation is solid, use subtIer tact ics, 
such as satire and ridi cule, to weaken YOUf opponent while making you out 
as a charming rogue. The mighty lion toys with the mouse that crosses his 
path-any other reaction would mar his fearsome reputat ion.

OBSER VA NCE OF THE LAW 
P. T. Barnum, America' s premier nineteenth-century showman, started his 
care er as an assistant to the owner of a circus, Aaron Turner. In 1836 the 
circus stopped in Annapolis, Maryland, for aseries of performances. On 
the morning of opening day, Bamum took a stroll through town, wearing a 
new black suit. People started to follow hirn. Someone in the gathering 
crowd shouted out that he was the Reverend Ephraim K. Avery, infam ous 
as a man acquitted of the charge of murder but still believed guilty by most 
America ns. The angry mob tore off Barnum's suit and was ready to lynch 
hirn . After desperate app eals, Barnum finally convinced them to follow 
hirn to the circus, where he could verify his ident ity. 
Once there, old Turner confirmed that this was all a practical joke-he 
hirnself had spread the rumor that Barnum was Avery. The crowd dis­
persed, but Barnum, who had nearly been killed, was not amused. He 
wanted to know what could have induced his boss to play such a trick. "My 
dear Mr. Barnum," Turner replied, "it was all for our good. Remember, all 
we need to ensure success is notori ety. " And indeed everyone in town was 
talking about the joke, and the circus was packed that night and every night 
it stayed in Anna polis. Barnum had learned a lesson he would never forget. 
Barnum's first big venture of his own was the American Museum-a 
collection of curiosit ies, located in New York. One day a beggar ap­
proached Barnum in the street. Instead of giving hirn money, Barnum de­
cided to employ hirn. Taking hirn back to the museum, he gave the man 
five bricks and told hirn to make a slow circuit of several blocks. At certain 
points he was to lay down a brick on the sidewalk, always keeping one 
brick in hand. On the return journey he was to replace each brick on the 
street with the one he held. Meanwhile he was to remain serious of counte­
nance and to answer no quest ions. Once back at the museum, he was to 
enter, walk around inside, then leave through the back door and make the 
same bricklaying circuit aga in.

46 LAW 6 thousand people into the museum. A few days later the police ordered hirn 
to cease and desist from his walks-the crowds were blocking traffic. The 
bricklaying stopped but thousands of New Yorkers had entered the mu­
seum, and many of those had become P. T. Barnum converts . 
Barnum would put a band of musicians on a balcony overlooking the 
street, benea th a huge banner proclaiming FREE MUSIC FOR THE MILLIONS. 
What generosity, New Yorkers thought, and they flocked to hear the free 
concerts . But Barnum took pains to hire the worst musicians he could find, 
and soon after the band struck up, people would hurry to buy tickets to the 
museum, where they would be out of earshot of the band's noise, and of 
the booing of the crowd. 
One of the first oddities Barnum toured around the country was Joice 
Heth, a woman he claimed was 161 years old, and whom he advertised as a 
slave who had once been George Washing ton's nurse. After several 
months the crowds began to dwin dle, so Barnum sent an anonymous letter 
to the papers, claiming that Heth was a clever fraud. joice Heth," he 
wrote, "is not a human being but an automaton, made up of whalebone, 
india-rub ber, and numb erless sprin gs." Those who had not bothered to see 
her before were immediately curious, and those who had already seen her 
paid to see her again, to find out whether the rumor that she was a robot 
was true. 
In 1842, Barnum purchas ed the carcass of what was purported to be a 
mermaid. This crea ture resembled a monkey with the body of a fish, but 
the head and body were perfectly joined -it was truly a wonder. After 
some research Barnum discovered that the creature had been expertly put 
together in Japan, where the hoax had caused quite a stir. 
He nevert heless planted articles in newspapers around the country 
claiming the capture of a mermaid in the Fiji Islands. He also sent the pa­
pers woodcut prints of paintings showing mermaids. By the time he showed 
the specimen in his museum, anational debate had been sparked over the 
existence of these mythical creature s. A few months before Barnum's cam­
paign, no one had cared or even known about mermaidsj now everyone 
was talking about them as if they were real. Crowds flocked in record num­
bers to see the Fiji Mermaid, and to hear debates on the subject. 
A few years later, Barnum toured Europe with General Tom Thumb, a 
five-year-old dwarf from Connecticut whom Barnum claimed was an 
eleven-year-old English boy, and whom he had trained to do many re­
markable acts. During this tour Barnum's name attracted such attenti on 
that Queen Victoria, that paragon of sobriety, requested a private audience 
with hirn and his talented dwarf at Buckingham Palac e. The English press 
may have ridiculed Bamum, but Victoria was royally entertained by hirn, 
and respected hirn ever after. 
Interpretation 
Barnum understood the fundamental truth about attracting attention: 
Once people's eyes are on you, you have a special legitimacy. For Barnum, 
creating interest meant creating a crowd ; as he later wrote, "Every crowd 
has a silver lining. " And crowds tend to act in con junction. If one person 
stops to see your beggarman laying bricks in the street, more will do the 
sarne. They will gather like dust bunn ies. Then, given a gentle push, they 
will enter your museum or watch your show. To create a crowd you have to 
do something diff erent and odd. Any kind of curiosity will serve the pur­
pose, for crowds are magnetically attracted by the unusual and inexplica­
ble. And once you have their attention, never let it go. If it veers toward 
other people, it does so at your expense. Barn um would ruthlessly suck at­
tention from his competitors, knowing what a valuable commodity it iso 
At the beginning of your rise to the top, then, spend all your energy on 
attracting attention. Most importa nt: The quality of the attention is irrele­
vant. No matter how badly his shows were reviewed, or how slanderously 
personal were the attacks on his hoaxes, Barnum would never complain. If 
a newspa per critic reviled hirn particularly badly, in fact, he made sure to 
invite the man to an opening and to give hirn the best seat in the house. He 
would even write anonymous attacks on his own work, just to keep his 
name in the papers . From Barnum's vantage, attention-wh ether negative 
or positive-was the main ingredient of his success. The worst fate in the 
world for a man who yearns farn e, glory, and, of course, power is to be 
ignor ed. 
If the courtier happens to engage in arms in some public spectacle 
such as jousting ... he will ensure that the horse he has is beautifully 
caparisoned, that he himself is suitably attired, with appropriate 
mottoes and ingenious devices to attract the eyes 0/ the onlookers 
in his direction as surely as the lodestone attracts iron. 
Raidassar e Castiglione, 1478-1529 
KEYS TO PO WER 
Burning more brightly than those around you is a skill that no one is born 
with. You have to team to attract attention, "as surely as the lodestone at­
tracts iron ." At the start of your career, you must attach your narne and rep­
utati on to a quality, an image, that sets you apart from other people. This 
image can be somet hing like a chara cteristic style of dress, or a perso nality 
quirk that amu ses people and gets talked about. Once the image is estab­
lished, you have an appeara nce, a place in the sky for your star. 
It is a common mistake to imagine that this peculiar appearance of 
yours should not be controversial, that to be attack ed is somehow bad. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. To avoid being a flash in the pan, 
and having your notoriety eclipsed by another, you must not discriminate 
between different types of atten tion; in the end, every kind will work in 
your favor. Barnum, we have seen, welcomed personal attacks and feIt 
no need to defend hirnself. He deliberately courted the image of being a 
humbug. reports Ihal C;ossaerl

THE COURT ARTIST ,

1993 
LAW 6 47 
48 LAW 6 The court of Louis XIV contained many talented writers, artists, great 
beauties, and men and women of impeccable virtue, but no one was more 
talked about than the singular Duc de Lauzun. The duke was short, almost 
dwarfish, and he was prone to the most insolent kinds of beha vior-he 
slept with the kin g's mistre ss, and openly insulted not only other courtiers 
but the king hirnself. Louis, however, was so beguiled by the duke 's eccen­
tricities that he could not bear his absences from the court. It was sim ple: 
The strange ness of the duke's character attracted attenti on. Once people 
were enthralled by hirn, they wanted hirn around at any cost. 
Society craves larger-than-life figures, people who stand above the 
general medio crity. Never be afraid, then, of the qualiti es that set you apart 
and draw attenti on to you. Court controversy, even scandal . It is better to 
be attacked, even slandered, than ignored. All professions are ruled by this 
law, and all professionals must have a bit of the showman about them. 
The great scientist Thomas Edison knew that to raise money he had to 
remain in the public eye at any cost. Almost as important as the inventions 
themselves was how he presented them to the public and courted attention. 
Edison would design visually dazzling experiments to display his dis­
coveries with elect ricity. He would talk of future inventions that seemed 
fantastic at the time- robots, and machines that could photograph 
thought-and that he had no intention of wasting his energy on, but that 
made the public talk about hirn. He did everything he could to make sure 
that he received more attention than his great riyal Nikola Tesla, who may 
actually have been more brilliant than he was but whose name was far less 
known. In 1915, it was rumored that Edison and Tesla would be joint recip­
ients of that year's Nobel Prize in phys ics. The prize was eventually given to 
a pair of English physicists ; only later was it discovered that the prize com­
mittee had actually approached Edison, but he had tumed them down, re­
fusing to share the prize with Tesla. By that time his fame was more seeure 
than Tesla's, and he thought it better to refuse the honor than to allow his 
riyal the attention that would have come even from sharing the prize. 
If you find yourself in a lowly position that offers little opportunity for 
you to draw attention, an effective trick is to attack the most visible, most 
famous, most powerful person you can find. When Pietro Aretino, a young 
Roman servant boy of the early sixteenth century, wanted to get attenti on 
as a writer of verses, he decided to publish aseries of satirical poems ridi­
culing the pope and his affection for a pet elephant. The attack put Aretino 
in the public eye immedia tely. A slanderous attack on a person in a posi­
tion of power would have a similar effect. Remember, however, to use such 
tactics sparingly after you have the public's attent ion, when the act can 
wear thin. 
Once in the limelight you must constantly renew it by adapting and 
varying your method of courting attention. If you don't, the public will 
grow tired, will take you for granted, and will move on to a newer star. The 
game requires constant vigilance and creativity. Pablo Picasso never al­
lowed hirnself to fade into the backg round; if his name became too at-
tached to a particular style, he would deliberately upset the public with a 
new series of paintings that went against all expectatio ns. Better to create 
something ugly and disturbing, he believed, than to let viewers grow too fa­
miliar with his work. Understand : People feel superior to the person whose 
actions they can predict. If you show them who is in control by playing 
againsttheir expe ctatio ns, you both gain their respect and tighten your hold 
on their fleeting attenti on.

50 LAW 6 PART II: CR EATE AN AIR OF MYSTER Y 
In a world growing increasingly banal and familiar, what seems enig­
matic instantly draws attention. Never make it too clear what you are 
doing or about to do. Do not show all your cards. An air of mystery height­
ens your presence; it also creates anticipation-every one will be watching 
you to see what happens next. Use mystery to beguile, seduce, even frighten. 
OBSER VA NCE OF THE LAW 
Beginning in 1905, rumors started to spread throughout Paris of a young 
Oriental girl who danced in a private horne, wrapp ed in veils that she grad­
ually discarded. A local journalist who had seen her dancing reported that 
"a woman from the Far East had come to Europe laden with perfume and 
jewels, to introduce some of the richness of the Oriental colour and life into 
the satiated society of European cities." Soon everyone knew the dancer's 
name : Mata Hari. 
Early that year, in the winter, small and select audiences would gather 
in a salon filled with Indian statu es and other relics while an orchestra 
played music inspired by Hindu andJava nese melodies. Mter keeping the 
audie nce waiting and wondering, Mata Hari would suddenly appear, in a 
startling costume : a white cotton brassiere coyered with Indian-type jewels; 
jeweled bands at the waist supporting a sarong that revealed as much as it 
concealed; bracelets up the arms. Then Mata Hari would dance, in a style 
no one in Fran ce had seen before, her whole body swaying as if she were in 
a tranc e. She told her excited and curious audience that her dances told 
stories from Indian mythology and Java nese folktales. Soon the cream of 
Paris, and ambassadors from far-off lands, were competing for invitations 
to the salon, where it was rumored that Mata Hari was actually performing 
sacred dances in the nude. 
The public wanted to know more about her. She told journalists that 
she was actually Dutch in origin, but had grown up on the island of Java. 
She would also talk about time spent in India, how she had leamed sacred 
Hindu dances there, and how Indian women "can shoot straight, ride 
horseback, and are capable of doing logarithms and talk philosophy." By 
the summer of 1905, although few Parisians had actually seen Mata Hari 
dance, her name was on everyone's lips. 
As Mata Hari gave more inter views, the story of her origins kept 
chang ing: She had grown up in India, her grandmother was the daughter 
of a Java nese princess, she had lived on the island of Sumatra where she 
had spent her time "horseback riding, gun in hand, and risking her life." 
No one knew anything certain about her, but journalists did not mind these 
changes in her biography. They compared her to an Indian goddess, a 
creature from the pages of Baudelair e--whatever their imagination wanted 
to see in this mysterious woman from the East. 
In August of 1905, Mata Hari performed for the first time in public. 
rCrowds thronging to see her on opening night caused a riot. She had now 
become a cult figure, spawning many imita tions. One reviewer wrote, 
"Mata Hari personifies all the poetry of India, its mysticism, its voluptuous­
ness, its hypnotizing charm." Another noted, "If India possesses such unex­
pected treasure s, then all Frenchmen will emigrate to the shores of the 
Gange s." 
Soon the fame of Mata Hari and her sacred Indian da nces spread be­
yond Paris. She was invited to Berlin, Vienna, Milan. Over the next few 
years she performed throughout Europ e, mixed with the high est social cir­
eIes, and eamed an income that gave her an independence rarely enjoyed 
by a woman of the period. Then, near the end of Wo rld War I, she was ar­
rested in France, tried, convicted, and finally executed as a German spy. 
Only during the trial did the truth come out: Mata Hari was not from Java 
or India, had not grown up in the Orient, did not have a drop of Eastem 
blood in her bod y. Her real name was Margaretha Zelle, and she came 
from the stolid northem province of Friesland, Holland. 
Interpretation 
When Marga retha Zelle arrived in Paris, in 1904, she had half a franc in 
her pocket. She was one of the thousands of beautiful young girls who 
flocked to Paris every year, taking work as artists' models, nightclub 
danc ers, or vaudevil le performers at the Folies Berge re. Mter a few years 
they would inevitably be replaced by younger girls, and would often end 
up on the streets, tuming to prostitution, or else retuming to the town they 
came from, older and chaste ned. 
Zelle had higher ambitions. She had no dance experience and had 
never performed in the theater, but as a young girl she had trave led with 
her family and had witnessed local dances in Java and Sumatra. Zelle 
eIearly understood that what was important in her act was not the dance it­
self, or even her face or figure, but her ability to create an air of mystery 
about herself. The mystery she created lay not just in her dancing, or her 
costum es, or the stories she would tell, or her endless lies about her origin s; 
it lay in an atmosphere enveloping everything she did. There was nothing 
you could say for sure about her-she was always changing, always sur­
prising her audience with new costumes, new dances, new stories. This air 
of mystery left the public always wanting to know more, always wondering 
about her next move. Mata Hari was no more beautiful than many of the 
other young girls who came to Paris, and she was not a particularly good 
dancer. What separated her from the mass, what attracted and held the 
public' s attention and made her famous and wealthy, was her mystery. 
Peop le are enthralled by mystery; because it invites constant interpreta­
tion, they never tire of it. The mysterious cannot be grasp ed. And what 
cannot be seized and consumed creates power. 
LAW 6 51 
52 LAW 6 KEYS TO POWER 
In the past, the world was filled with the terrifying and unknowable­
diseases, disasters, capricious despots, the mystery of death itself. What we 
could not understand we reimagined as myths and spirits. Over the cen­
turies, though, we have manage d, through science and reason, to illumi­
nate the dark ness; what was mysterious and forbidding has grown familiar 
and comfortable. Yet this light has a price: in a world that is ever more 
banal, that has had its mystery and myth squeezed out of it, we secretly 
crave enigmas, people or things that cannot be instantly interpreted, 
seized, and consume d. 
That is the power of the mysterious : It invites layers of interpreta tion, 
excites our imagination, seduces us into believing that it conceals some­
thing marvelous. The world has become so familiar and its inhabitants so 
predictable that what wraps itself in mystery will almost always draw the 
limelight to it and make us watch it. 
Do not imagine that to create an air of mystery you have to be grand 
and awe-inspiring. Mystery that is woven into your day-to-day demeanor, 
and is subtle, has that much more power to fascinate and attract attention. 
Remember: Most people are upfront, can be read like an open book, take 
little care to control their words or image, and are hopelessly predicta ble. 
By simply holding back, keeping silent, occasionally uttering ambiguous 
phrases, deliberately appearing inconsistent, and acting odd in the subtlest 
of ways, you will emanate an aura of mystery. The people around you will 
then magnify that aura by constantly trying to interpret you. 
Both artists and con artists understand the vital link between being 
mysterious and attracting interest. Count Victor Lustig, the aristocrat of 
swindlers, played the game to perfection. He was always doing things that 
were different, or seemed to make no sense. He would show up at the best 
hotels in a limo driven by a Japanese chauffeur; no one had ever seen a 
Japanese chauffeur before, so this seemed exotic and strange. Lustig would 
dress in the most expensive clothing, but always with something-a medal, 
a flower, an armband-out of place, at least in conventional terms. This 
was seen not as tasteless but as odd and intriguing. In hotels he would be 
seen receiving telegrams at all hours, one after the other, brought to hirn by 
his Japanese chauffeur-te legrams he would tear up with utter noncha­
lance. (In fact they were fakes, completely blank.) He would sit alone in the 
dining room, reading a large and impressive-Iooking book, smiling at peo­
pIe yet remaining aloof. Within a few days, of course, the entire hotel 
would be abuzz with interest in this strange man. 
All this attention allowed Lustig to lure suckers in with ease. They 
would beg for his confidence and his compa ny. Everyone wanted to be 
seen with this mysterious aristocrat. And in the presence of this distracting 
enigma, they wouldn't even notice that they were being robbed blind. 
An air of mystery can make the mediocre appear intelligent and pro­
found. It made Mata Hari, a woman of average appearance and intelli­
gence, seem like a goddess, and her dancing divinely inspired. An air of 
mystery about an artist makes his or her artwork immediately more intrigu­
ing, a trick Marcel Duchamp played to great effect. It is all very easy to 
do-say little about your work, tease and titillate with alluring, even contra­
dictory comments, then stand back and let others try to make sense of it all. 
Mysterious people put others in a kind of inferior position-that of try­
ing to figure them out. To degrees that they can control, they also elicit the 
fear surrounding anything uncertain or unknown. All great leaders know 
that an aura of mystery draws attention to them and creates an intimidating 
presence. Mao Tse-tung, for example, cleverly cultivated an enigmatic 
image; he had no worries about seeming inconsistent or contradicting him­
self-the very contradictoriness of his actions and words meant that he al­
ways had the upper hand. No one, not even his own wife, ever feIt they 
understood hirn, and he therefore seemed larger than life. This also meant 
that the public paid constant attention to hirn, ever anxious to witness his 
nextmove. 
If your social position prevents you from completely wrapping your 
actions in mystery, you must at least learn to make yourself less obvious. 
Every now and then, act in a way that does not mesh with other people's 
perception of you. This way you keep those around you on the defensive, 
eliciting the kind of attention that makes you powerful . Done right, the cre­
ation of enigma can also draw the kind of attention that strikes terror into 
your enemy. 
During the Second Punic War (219-202 B.C.), the great Carthaginian 
general Hannibal was wreaking havoc in his march on Rome. Hannibal 
was known for his cleverness and duplicity. 
Under his leadership Carthage 's army, though smaller than those of 
the Romans, had constantly outmaneuvered them. On one occasion, 
though, Hanniba l's scouts made a horrible blunder, leading his troops into 
a marshy terrain with the sea at their back. The Roman army blocked the 
mountain passes that led inland, and its general, Fabius, was ecstatic-at 
last he had Hannibal trapped. Posting his best sentries on the passes, he 
worked on a plan to destroy Hanniba l's forces. But in the middle of the 
night, the sentries looked down to see a mysterious sight: A huge pro ces­
sion of lights was heading up the mountain. Thousands and thousands of 
lights. If this was Hannibal's army, it had suddenly grown a hundredf old. 
The sentries argued heatedly about what this could mean: Reinforce­
ments from the sea? Troops that had been hidden in the area? Ghosts ? No 
explana tion made sense. 
As they watched, fires broke out all over the mountain, and a horrible 
noise drifted up to them from below, like the blowing of a million horns. 
Demons, they thought. The sentries, the bravest and most sensible in the 
Roman army, fled their posts in a panic. 
By the next day, Hannibal had escaped from the marshla nd. What was 
his trick? Had he really cOI�ured up demons? Actually what he had done 
was order bundles of twigs to be fastened to the horns of the thousands of 
oxen that traveled with his troops as beasts of burden. The twigs were then 
LAW 6 53 
54 , LAW 6 lit, giving the impression of the torches of a vast army heading up the 
mountain. When the flarnes burned down to the oxen's skin, they stam­
peded in all directions, bellowing like mad and setting fires all over the 
mountain side. The key to this device's success was not the torches, the 
fires, or the noises in themselves, however, but the fact that Hannibal had 
created a puzzle that captivate d the sentries' attention and gradually terri­
fied them. From the mountaintop there was no way to explain this bizarre 
sight. If the sentries could have explain ed it they would have stayed at their 
posts. 
If you find yourself trapped, cornered, and on the defensive in some 
situation, try a simple experiment: Do somet hing that cannot be easily ex­
plained or interpreted. Choose a simple action, but carry it out in a way 
that unsettles your opponent, a way with many possible interpreta tions, 
making your intentions obscure. Don't just be unpredictable (although this 
tactic too can be successful-see Law 17); like Hannibal, create a scene that 
cannot be read. There will seem to be no method to your madness, no 
rhyme or reason, no single explanation. If you do this right, you will in­
spire fear and trembling and the sentries will abandon their posts. Call it 
the "feigned madness of Harnlet" tactic, for Harnlet uses it to great effect in 
Shakespeare's play, frightening his stepfather Claudius through the mys­
tery of his behavior. The mysterious makes your forces seem larger, your 
power more terrifying.

Authority: If you do not declare yourself immediately, you arouse 
expectation .... Mix a litde mystery with everything, and the very 
mystery stirs up veneration. And when you explain, be not too ex­
plicit. . . . In this manner you imitate the Divine way when you 
cause men to wonder and watch. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658) 
REVERSAL 
In the beginning of your rise to the top, you must attraet attention at all 
cost, but as you rise higher you must constantly adapt. Never wear the pub­
lic out with the same tactic. An air of mystery works wonders for those who 
need to develop an aura of power and get themselves noticed, but it must 
seem measured and under control. Mata Hari went too far with her fabri­
cations; although the accusation that she was a spy was false, at the time it 
was a reasonable presumption because all her lies made her seem suspi­
cious and nefarious. Do not let your air of mystery be slowly transformed 
into areputation for deceit. The mystery you create must seem agame, 
playful and unthreatening. Recognize when it goes too far, and puH back. 
There are times when the need for attention must be deferred, and 
when scandal and notoriety are the last things you want to create. The at­
tention you attraet must never offend or challenge the reputation of those 
above you-not, at any rate, if they are secure. You will seem not only pal­
try but desperate by compari son. There is an art to knowing when to draw 
notice and when to withdraw. 
Lola Montez was one of the great practit ioners of the art of attracting 
attention. She managed to rise from a middle-class lrish background to 
being the lover of Franz Liszt and then the mistress and political adviser of 
King Ludwig of Bavaria. In her later years, though, she lost her sense of 
proport ion. 
In London in 1850 there was to be a performa nce of Shakespeare's 
Macbeth featuring the greatest actor of the time, Charles John Kean. Every­
one of consequence in English society was to be there; it was rumored that 
even Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were to make a public appearance. 
The custom of the period demanded that everyone be seated before the 
queen arrived. So the audience got there a little early, and when the queen 
entered her royal box, they observed the convention of standing up and 
applauding her. The royal couple waited, then bowed. Everyone sat down 
and the lights were dimmed. Then, suddenly, all eyes turned to a box op­
posite Queen Victoria' s: A woman appeared from the shadows, taking her 
seat later than the queen. It was Lola Montez. She wore a diamond tiara on

royal couple deliberately avoided looking at Lola's box. They foHowed 
Victoria's example, and for the rest of the evening Lola Montez was ig­

with her. All her magnetic powers were rever sed. People would flee her 
sight. Her future in England was fini shed. 
Never appear overly greedy for attention, then, for it signals insecurity, 
and insecurity drives power away. Understand that there are times when it 
is not in your interest to be the center of attention. When in the presence of 
a king or queen, for instance, or the equivalent thereof, bow and retreat to 
the shadows; never compete.

TRANSGRESSION AND OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW 
In 1883 a young Serbian scientist named Nikola Tesla was working for the 
European division of the Continental Edison Company. He was a brilliant 
inventor, and Charles Batchelor, a plant manager and a personal friend of 
Thomas Edison, persuaded him he should seek his fortune in America, giv­
ing hirn a letter of introduction to Edison hirnself. So began a life of woe 
and tribulation that lasted until Tesla's death. 
When Tesla met Edison in New York, the famous inventor hired him 
on the spot. Tesla worked eighteen-hour days, finding ways to improve the 
primitive Edison dynamo s. Finally he offered to redesign them completely. 
To Edison this seemed a monumental task that could last years without 
paying off, but he told Tesla, "There's fifty thousand dollars in it for you-if 
you can do it." Tesla labored day and night on the project and after only a 
year he produced a greatly improved version of the dynamo, complete 
with automatie controls. He went to Edison to break the good news and re­
ceive his $50,000. Edison was pleased with the improvement, for which he 
and his company would take credit, but when it came to the issue of the 
money he told the young Serb, "Tesla, you don't understand our American 
humor!," and offered a small raise instead. 
Tesla's obsession was to create an altemating-current system (AC) of 
electricity. Edison believed in the direct-current system (DC), and not only 
refused to support Tesla's research but later did all he could to sabotage 
him. Tesla tumed to the great Pittsburgh magnate George Westinghouse, 
who had started his own electricity company. Westinghouse completely 
funded Tesla's research and offered hirn a generous royalty agreement on 
future profits. The AC system Tesla developed is still the standard today­
but after patents were filed in his name, other scientists came forward to 
take credit for the invention, claiming that they had laid the groundwork 
for hirn. His name was lost in the shuffle, and the public came to associate 
the invention with Westinghouse hirnself. 
A year later, Westinghouse was caught in a takeover bid from 
J. Pierpont Morgan, who made hirn rescind the generous royalty contract 
he had signed with Tesla. Westinghouse explained to the scientist that his 
company would not survive if it had to pay hirn his full royalties; he per­
suaded Tesla to accept a buyout of his patents for $216,000-a large sum, 
no doubt, but far less than the $12 million they were worth at the time. The 
financiers had divested Tesla of the riches, the paten ts, and essentially the 
credit for the greatest invention of his career. 
The name of Guglielmo Marconi is forever linked with the invention 
of radio. But few know that in producing his invention-he broadcast a sig­
nal across the English Channel in 1899-Marconi made use of a patent 
Tesla had filed in 1897, and that his work depended on Tesla's research. 
Once again Tesla received no money and no credit. Tesla invented an in­
duction motor as well as the AC power system, and he is the real "father of 
radio." Yet none of these discoveries bear his name. As an old man, he 
lived in poverty. THE TORTOISE. THE

One day the tortoise

where he was, so the

him, but could not

asked him to come

produced a lang rope

shouted "Hey!" 
Then the tortoise ran

58 LAW 7 In 1917, during his later impoverished years, Tesla was told he was to 
receive the Edison Medal of the American Institute of Electrical Eng ineers. 
He tumed the medal down. "You propose, " he said, "to honor me with a 
medal which I could pin upon my coat and strut for a vain hOUf before the 
members of your Institu te. You would decorate my body and continue to 
let starve, for failure to supply recognition, my mind and its creative prod­
ucts, which have supplied the foundation upon which the major portion of 
your Institute exists ." 
Interpretation 
Many harb or the illusion that science, dealing with facts as it does, is be­
yond the petty rivalries that trouble the rest of the world. Nikola Tesla was 
one of those. He believed science had nothing to do with politics, and 
claimed not to care for farne and riches, As he grew older, though, this ru­
ined his scientific work. Not associated with any particular discovery, he 
could attract no investors to his many ideas. While he pondered great in­
ventions for the future, others stole the patents he had already developed 
and got the glory for themselves. 
He wanted to do everything on his own, but merely exhausted and im­
poverished hirnself in the process. 
Edison was Tesla's polar opposite . He wasn't actually much of a scien­
tific thinker or inventor; he once said that he had no need to be a mathe­
matician because he could always hire one. That was Edison's main 
method. He was really a businessman and publicist, spotting the trends and 
the oppor tuniti es that were out there, then hiring the best in the field to do 
the work for him. If he had to he would steal from his competitors . Yet his 
name is much better known than Tesla's, and is associated with more in­
ventions. 
The lesson is twof old: First, the credit for an invention or creation is as 
important, if not more important, than the invention itself. You must seeUfe 
the credit for YOUfseif and keep others from stealing it away, or from piggy­
backing on YOUf hard work. To accomplish this you must always be vigilant 
and ruthless, keeping YOUf creation quiet until you can be SUfe there are no 
vultures circling overhead. Second, leam to take advantage of other peo­
ple's work to further YOUf own cause. Time is precious and life is short. If 
you try to do it all on YOUf own, you run yourself ragge d, waste energy, and 
bum yourself out. It is far better to conserve your forces, pounce on the 
work others have done, and find a way to make it YOUf own. 
Everybody steals in commerce and industry. 
I've stolen a lot myself. 
But I know how to steal. 
Thomas Edison, 18 47 -1931 
KEYS TO POWER 
The world of power has the dynamics of the jungle: There are those who 
live by hunting and killing, and there are also vast numbers of creatures 
(hyenas, vultures) who live off the hunting of others. These latter, less 
imaginative types are often incapable of doing the work that is essential for 
the creation of power. They understand early on, though, that if they wait 
long enough, they can always find another animal to do the work for them. 
Do not be naive: At this very moment, while you are slaving away on some 
project, there are vultures cirding above trying to figure out a way to sur­
vive and even thrive off your creativity. It is useless to complain about this, 
or to wear yourself ragged with bittemess, as Tesla did. Better to protect 
yourself and join the game. Once you have established a power base, be­
come a vulture yourse lf, and save yourself a lot of time and energy. 
Of the two poles of this game, one can be illustrated by the example of 
the explorer Vasco Nliiiez de Balboa. Balboa had an obsession-the dis­
covery of EI Dorado, a legendary city of vast riches. 
Early in the sixteenth century, after countless hardships and brushes 
with death, he found evidence of a great and wealthy empire to the south 
of Mexico, in present-day Peru. By conquering this empire, the Incan, and 
seizing its gold, he would make hirnself the next Cortes. The problem was 
that even as he made this discovery, word of it spread among hundreds of 
other conquistad ors. He did not understand that half the game was keeping 
it quiet, and carefully watching those around hirn. A few years after he dis­
covered the location of the Incan empire, a soldier in his own army, Fran­
cisco Pizarro, helped to get hirn beheaded for treason . Pizarro went on to 
take what Balboa had spent so many years trying to find. 
The other pole is that of the artist Peter Paul Rubens, who, late in his 
career, found hirnself deluged with requests for paintings . He created a sys­
tem: In his large studio he employed dozens of outstanding painters, one 
specializing in robes, another in backgr ounds, and so on. He created a vast 
production line in which a large number of canvases would be worked on 
at the same time. When an important dient visited the studio, Rubens 
would shoo his hired painters out for the day. While the dient watched 
from a balcony, Rubens would work at an incredible pace, with unbeliev­
able energy. The dient would leave in awe of this prodigious man, who 
could paint so many masterpi eces in so short a time. 
This is the essence of the Law: Leam to get others to do the work for 
you while you take the credit, and you appear to be of godlike strength and 
power. If you think it important to do all the work yourself, you will never 
get far, and you will suffer the fate of the Balboas and Teslas of the world. 
Find people with the skills and creativity you lack. Either hire them, while 
putting your own name on top of theirs, or find a way to take their work 
and make it your own. Their creativity thus becomes yours, and you seem 
a genius to the world. 
There is another application of this law that does not require the para­
sitic use of your contemporaries' labor: Use the past, a vast storehouse of 1111· 111.1 ''') 111\

60 LAW 7 knowledge and wisdom. Isaac Newton called this "standing on the shoul­
ders of giants." He meant that in making his discoveries he had built on the 
achievements of others. A great part of his aura of genius, he knew, was at­
tributable to his shrewd ability to make the most of the insights of ancient, 
medieval, and Renaissance scientists. Shakespeare borrowed plots, charac­
terizations, and even dialogue from Plutarch, among other writers, for he 
knew that nobody surpassed Plutarch in the writing of subtle psychology 
and witty quotes. How many later writers have in their turn borrowed 
from-plagiarize d--Shakespeare? 
We all know how few of today's politicians write their own speeches. 
Their own words would not win them a single vote ; their eloquence and 
wit, whatever there is of it, they owe to a speech writer. Other people 
do the work, they take the credit. The upside of this is that it is a kind 
of power that is available to everyone. Leam to use the knowledge of the 
past and you will look like a genius, even when you are really just adever 
borrower. 
Writers who have delved into human nature, ancient masters of strat­
egy, historians of human stupidity and folly, kings and queens who have 
leamed the hard way how to handle the burdens of power-their knowl­
edge is gathering dust, waiting for you to come and stand on their shoul­
ders. Their wit can be your wit, their skill can be your skill, and they will 
never come around to tell people how unoriginal you really are. You can 
slog through life, making endless mistakes, wasting time and energy trying 
to do things from your own experience. Or you can use the armies of the 
past. As Bismarck once said, "Fools say that they leam by experienc e. I 
prefer to profit by others' experience." 
Image: The Vult ure. Of all the creatures in 
the jungle, he has it the easiest. The 
hard work of others becomes his work; 
their failure to survive becomes his 
nourishment. Keep an eye on 
the Vulture-while you are 
hard at work, he is cir-
ding above. Do not 
fight him, join 
hirn. 
Authority : There is much to be known, life is short, and life is not life 
without knowledge. It is therefore an excellent device to acquire 
knowledge from everybody. Thus, by the sweat of another's brow, you 
win the reputation of being an orade. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601- 1658) 
REVERSAL 
There are times when taking the credit for work that others have done is 
not the wise course: If your power is not firmly enough established, you 
will seem to be pushing people out of the limelight. To be a brilliant ex­
ploiter of talent your position must be unshakable, or you will be accused 
of deception. 
Be sure you know when letting other people share the credit serves 
your purpose. It is especially important to not be greedy when you have a 
master above you. President Richard Nixon's historie visit to the People's 
RepubHc of China was originally his idea, but it might never have come off 
but for the deft diplomacy of Henry Kissinger. Nor would it have been as 
successful without Kissinger's skills. Still, when the time came to take 
credit, Kissinger adroitly let Nixon take the Hon's share. Knowing that the 
truth would come out later, he was careful not to jeopardize his standing in 
the short term by hogging the limelight. Kissinger played the game ex­
pertly: He took credit for the work of those below hirn while graciously 
giving credit for his own labors to those above. That is the way to play 
the game.

OBSER VA NCE OF THE LAW 
At the Congress ofVienna in 1814, the major powers ofEurope gathered to 
carve up the remains of Napoleon's fallen Empire. The city was fuH of gai­
ety and the balls were the most splendid in memory. Hovering over the 
proceedings , however, was the shadow of Napoleon hirnself. Instead of 
being executed or exiled far away, he had been sent to the island of Elba, 
not far from the co ast of Italy. 
Even imprisoned on an island, a man as bold and creative as 
Napoleon Bonaparte made everyone nervous. The Austrians plotted to kill 
hirn on Elba, but decided it was too risky. Alexander I, Russia's tempera­
mental czar, heightened the anxiety by throwing a fit during the congress 
when apart of Poland was denied him: "Beware, I shall loose the mon­
ster!" he threatened. Everyone knew he meant Napoleon. Of all the states­
men gathered in Vienna, only Talleyrand, Napoleon's former foreign 
minister, seemed calm and unconcerned. It was as if he knew something 
the others did not. 
Meanwhile, on the island of Elba, Napoleon's life was a mockery of his 
previous glory. As Elba's "king," he had been allowed to form a court­
there was a cook, a wardrobe mistress, an official pianist, and a handful of 
courtiers. All this was designed to humiliate Napoleon, and it seemed to 
work. 
That winter, however, there occurred aseries of events so strange and 
dramatic they might have been scripted in a play. Elba was surrounded by 
British ships, their cannons covering all possible exit points. Yet somehow, 
in broad daylight on 26 February 1815, a ship with nine hundred men on 
board picked up Napoleon and put to sea. The English gave chase but the 
ship got away. This almost impossible escape astonished the public 
throughout Europe, and terrified the statesmen at the Congress of Vienna. 
Although it would have been safer to leave Europe, Napoleon not only 
chose to return to France, he raised the odds by marching on Paris with a 
tiny army, in hopes of recapturing the throne. His strategy worked- people 
of all classes threw themselves at his feet. An army under Marshal Ney sped 
from Paris to arrest hirn, but when the soldiers saw their beloved former 
leader, they changed sides. Napoleon was declared emperor again. Volun­
teers swelled the ranks of his new army. Delirium swept the country. In Paris, 
crowds went wild. The king who had replaced Napoleon fled the country. 
For the next hundred days, Napoleon ruled France. Soon, however, the 
giddiness subsided. France was bankrupt, its resources nearly exhausted, 
and there was little Napoleon could do about this. At the Battle ofWaterloo, 
in June of that year, he was finally defeated for good. This time his enemies 
had learned their lesson: They exiled hirn to the barren island of Saint He­
lena, off the west coast of Mrica. There he had no more hope of escape. 
Interpretation 
Only years later did the facts of Napoleon's dramatic escape from Elba 
come to light. Before he decided to attempt this bold move, visitors to his 
court had told hirn that he was more popular in France than ever, and that 
LAW 8 63 
64 LAW 8 the country would embrace hirn again. One of these visitors was Austria's 
General Koller, who convinced Napoleon that if he escaped, the European 
powers, England included, would welcome him back into power. Napoleon 
was tipped off that the English would let hirn go, and indeed his escape oc­
curred in the middle of the afternoon, in full view of English spyglasses. 
What Napoleon did not know was that there was a man behind it all, 
pulling the strings, and that this man was his former minister, Talleyran d. 
And Talleyrand was doing all this not to bring back the glory days but to 
crush Napoleon once and for all. Considering the emperor's ambition un­
settling to Europe's stability, he had turned against hirn long ago. When 
Napoleon was exiled to Elba, Talleyrand had protested. Napoleon should 
be sent farther away, he argued, or Europe would never have peace. But 
no one listened. 
Instead of pushing his opinion, Talleyrand bided his time. Working 
quietly, he eventually won over Castlereagh and Mettemich, the foreign 
ministers of England and Austria. 
Together these men baited Napoleon into escaping. Even Koller's visit, 
to whisper the promise of glory in the exile's ear, was part of the plan. Like 
a master cardplayer, Talleyrand figured everything out in advance. He 
knew Napoleon would fall into the trap he had set. He also foresaw that 
Napoleon would lead the country into a war, which, given France's weak­
ened condition, could only last a few months . One diplomat in Vienna, 
who understood that Talleyrand was behind it all, said, "He has set the 
house ablaze in order to save it from the plague ." 
When I have laid bait for deer,

Dito von Bismarck, 1815-1898 
KEYS TO POWER 
How many times has this scenario played itself out in history : An aggres­
sive leader initiates aseries of bold moves that begin by bringing hirn 
much power. Slowly, however, his power reaches a peak, and soon every­
thing turns against hirn. His numerous enemies band toget her; trying to 
maintain his power, he exhausts hirnself going in this direction and that, 
and inevitably he collapses. The reason for this pattern is that the aggres­
sive person is rarely in full control. He cannot see more than a couple of 
moves ahead, cannot see the consequences of this bold move or that one. 
Because he is constantly being forced to react to the moves of his ever­
growing host of enemies, and to the unforeseen consequences of his own 
rash actions, his aggressive energy is turned against hirn. 
In the realm of power, you must ask yoursel f, what is the point of chas­
ing here and there, trying to solve problems and defeat my enemies, if I 
never feel in contro!? Why am I always having to react to events instead of 
directing them? The answer is simple: Your idea of power is wrong. You 
have mistaken aggressive action for effective action. And most often the 
most effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let others be frustrated 
by the traps you lay for them, playing for long-term power rather than 
quick victory. 
Rememb er: The essence of power is the ability to keep the initiative, 
to get others to react to your moves, to keep YOUf opponent and those 
around you on the defensive. When you make other people come to you, 
you suddenly become the one controlling the situation. And the one who 
has control has power. Two things must happen to place you in this posi­
tion: You yourself must learn to master YOUf emotions, and never to be in­
fluenced by anger; meanwhil e, however, you must play on people's natural 
tendency to react angrily when pushed and baited. In the long run, the 
ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any 
tool of aggression. 
Study how Talleyrand, the master of the art, performed this delicate 
trick. First, he overcame the urge to try to convince his fellow statesmen 
that they needed to banish Napoleon far away. It is only natural to want to 
persuade people by pleading YOUf case, imposing YOUf will with words. But 
this often turns against you. Few of Talleyrand's contemporaries believed 
Napoleon was still a threat, so that if he had spent a lot of energy trying to 
convince them, he would only have made himself look foolish. Instead, he 
held his tongue and his emotions in check. Most important of all, he laid 
Napoleon a sweet and irresistible trap. He knew the man's weakness, his 
impetuosity, his need for glory and the love of the masses, and he played 
all this to perfection. When Napoleon went for the bait, there was no dan­
ger that he might succeed and turn the tables on Talleyrand, who better 
than anyone knew France's depleted state. And even had Napoleon been 
able to overcome these difficulties, the likelihood of bis success would have 
been greater were he able to choose his time and place of action. By setting 
the proper trap, Talleyrand took the time and place into his own hands. 
All of us have only so much energy, and there is a moment when OUf 
energies are at their peak. When you make the other person come to you, 
he wears himself out, wasting his energy on the trip. In the year 1905, Rus­
sia and Japan were at war. The J apanese had only recently begun to mod­
emize their warships, so that the Russians had a stronger navy, but by 
spreading false information the Japanese marshal Togo Heihachiro baited 
the Russians into leaving their docks in the Baltic Sea, making them believe 
they could wipe out the J apanese fleet in one swift attack. The Russian fleet 
could not reach Japan by the quickest route-through the Strait of Gibral­
tar and then the Suez Canal into the Indian Ocean- because these were 
controlled by the British, and Japan was an ally of Great Britain. They had 
to go around the Cape of Good Hope, at the southern tip of Africa, adding 
over more than six thousand miles to the voyage. Once the fleet passed the 
Cape, the Japanese spread another false story: They were sailing to launch 
a counterattack . So the Russians made the entire journey to Japan on com­
bat alert. By the time they arrived, their seamen were tense, exhausted, and 
overworke d, while the Japanese had been waiting at their ease. Despite the 
LAW 8 65 
66 LAW 8 odds and their lack of experience in modem naval warfare, the Japanese 
crushed the Russians. 
One added benefit of making the opponent come to you, as the Japa­
nese discovered with the Russians, is that it forces hirn to operate in your 
territory. Being on hostile ground will make hirn nervous and often he will 
rush his actions and make mistakes. For negotiations or meetings, it is al­
ways wise to lure others into your territory, or the territory of your choice. 
You have your bearings, while they see nothing familiar and are subtly 
placed on the defensive. 
Manipulation is a dangerous game. Once someone suspects he is 
being manipulated, it becomes harder and harder to control hirn. But 
when you make your opponent come to you, you create the illusion that he 
is controlling the situation. He does not feel the strings that pull hirn, just as 
Napoleon imagined that he hirnself was the master of his daring escape and 
return to power. 
Everything depends on the sweetness of your bait. If your trap is at­
tractive enough, the turbulence of your enemies' emotions and desires will 
blind them to reality. The greedier they become, the more they can be led 
around. 
The great nineteenth-century robber baron Daniel Drew was a master 
at playing the stock market. When he wanted a particular stock to be 
bought or sold, driving prices up or down, he rarely resorted to the direct 
approach. One of his tricks was to hurry through an exclusive club near 
Wall Street, obviously on his way to the stock exchange, and to pull out his 
customary red bandanna to wipe his perspiring brow. A slip of paper 
would fall from this bandanna that he would pretend not to notice. The 
club's members were always trying to foresee Drew's moves, and they 
would pounce on the paper, which invariably seemed to contain an inside 
tip on a stock. Word would spread, and members would buy or seIl the 
stock in droves, playing perfectly into Drew's hands. 
If you can get other people to dig their own graves, why sweat your­
self? Pickpockets work this to perfection. The key to picking a pocket is 
knowing which pocket contains the wallet. Experienced pickpockets often 
ply their trade in train stations and other places where there is a clearly

variably feel for their wallet to make sure it is still there. For the watching 
pickpockets, this is like shooting fish in a barrel. Pickpockets have even

When you are making people come to you, it is sometimes better to let 
them know you are forcing their hand. You give up deception for overt ma­
nipulation. The psychological ramificati ons are profound: The person who 
makes others come to hirn appears powernd, and demands respect. 
Filippo Brunelleschi, the great Renaissance artist and architect, was a 
great practitioner of the art of making others come to hirn as a sign of his 
power. On one occasion he had been engaged to repair the dome of the 
Santa Maria deI Fiore cathedral in Florence. The commission was impor-
taut and prestigious. But when the city officials hired a second man, 
Lorenzo Ghiberti, to work with Brunelleschi, the great artist brooded in se­
cret. He knew that Ghiberti had gotten the job through his connections, 
and that he would do none of the work and get half the credit. At a critical 
moment of the construction, then, Brunelleschi suddenly developed a mys­
terious illness. He had to stop work, but pointed out to city officials that 
they had hired Ghiberti, who should have been able to continue the work 
on his OWll. Soon it became dear that Ghiberti was useless and the officials 
came begging to Brunelleschi. He ignored them, insisting that Ghiberti 
should finish the project, until finally they realized the problem: They fired 
Ghiberti. 
By some mirade, Brunelleschi recovered within days. He did not have 
to throw a tautrum or make a fool of hirnself; he simply practiced the art of 
"making others come to you." 
If on one occasion you make it a point of dignity that others must 
come to you and you succeed, they will continue to do so even after you 
stop trying. 
Image: The Honeyed 
Bear Trap. The bear hunter 
does not chase his prey; a bear 
that knows it is hunted is nearly 
impossible to catch and is fero­
cious if cornered. Instead, the 
hunter lays traps baited with 
honey. He does not exhaust 
himself and risk his life in 
pursuit He baits, then waits. 
Authority: Good warriors make others 
come to them, and do not go to others. This 
is the principle of emptiness and fullness 
of others and self. When you induce oppo­
nents to come to you, then their force is 
always empty; as long as you do not 
go to them, your force is always full. Attack­
ing emptiness with fullness is like throwing 
stones on eggs. (Zhang Yu, eleventh­
century commen tator on The Art of War) 
LAW 8 67 
68 LAW 8 REVERSAL 
Although it is generally the wiser policy to make others exhaust themselves 
chasing you, there are opposite cases where striking suddenly and aggres­
sively at the enemy SO demoralizes hirn that his energies sink. Instead of 
making others come to you, you go to them, force the issue, take the lead. 
Fast attack can be an awesome weapon, for it forces the other person to 
react without the time to think or plan. With no time to think, people make 
errors of judgment, and are thrown on the defensive. This tactic is the ob­
verse of waiting and baiting, but it serves the same function: You make 
your enemy respond on your terms. 
Men like Cesare Borgia and Napoleon used the element of speed to in­
timidate and control. A rapid and unforeseen move is terrifying and de­
moralizing. You must choose YOUf tactics depending on the situation. If 
you have time on YOUf side, and know that you and your enemies are at 
least at equal strength, then deplete their strength by making them come to 
you. If time is against YOU-yOUf enemies are weaker, and waiting will only 
give them the chance to recover-give them no such chance. Strike quickly 
and they have nowhere to go. As the boxer Joe Louis put it, "He can run, 
but he can't hide ."

70 LAW 9 TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW 
In 131 B.C., the Roman consul Publius Crassus Dives Mucianus, laying 
siege to the Greek town of Pergamus, found hirnself in need of a battering 
ram to force through the town 's walls. He had seen a couple of hefty ship's 
masts in a shipyard in Athens a few days before, and he ordered that the 
larger of these be sent to hirn immedia tely. The military engi neer in Ath ens 
who received the order feit certain that the consul really wanted the 
smaller of the masts . He argued endlessly with the soldiers who delive red 
the request: The smaller mast, he told them, was much better suited to the 
task. And indeed it would be easier to transport. 
The soldiers warned the engi neer that their master was not a man to 
argue with, but he insisted that the smaller mast would be the only one that 
would work with a machine that he was constructing to go with it. He drew 
diagram after diag ram, and went so far as to say that he was the expert and 
they had no clue what they were talking about. The soldiers knew their 
leader and at last convinced the engineer that it would be better to swallow 
his expertise and obey . 
After they left, though, the engineer thought about it some more. What 
was the point, he asked hirns elf, in obeying an order that would lead to fail­
ure? And so he sent the smaller mast, confident that the consul would see 
how much more effective it was and reward hirn just ly. 
When the smaller mast arrived, Mucianus aske d his soldiers for an ex­
planat ion. They described to hirn how the engineer had argued endlessly 
for the smaller mast, but had finally promised to send the larger one. Mu­
cianus went into a rage . He could not concentrate on the siege, or consider 
the importance of breaching the walls before the town received reinf orce­
ments. All he could think about was the impudent engineer, whom he or­
dered to be brought to hirn immediately. 
Arriving a few days later, the engi neer gladly explained to the consul, 
one more time, the reasons for the smaller mast. He went on and on, using 
the same arguments he had made with the soldiers. He said it was wise to 
listen to experts in these matters, and if the attack was only tried with the 
battering ram he had sent, the consul would not regret it. Mucianus let hirn 
finish, then had him stripped naked before the soldiers and flogged and 
scourged with rods until he died. 
Interpretation 
The engineer, whose name has not been recorded by history, had spent his 
life designing masts and pillars, and was respected as the finest engineer in 
a city that had excelled in the science. He knew that he was right. A smaller 
ram would allow more speed and carry more force. Larger is not neces sar­
ily better. Of course the consul would see his logic, and would eventually 
understand that science is neutral and reason superior. How could the con­
sul possibly persist in his ignorance if the engineer showed him detailed di­
agrams and explained the theories behind his advi ce? 
The military engineer was the quinte ssence of the Arguer, a type 
found everywhere among uso The Arguer does not understand that words 
are never neutral, and that by arguing with a superior he impugns the intel­
ligenee of one more powerful than he. He also has no awareness of the per­
son he is dealing with. Sinee each man believes that he is right, and words 
will rarely eonvinee hirn otherw ise, the arguer's reasoning falls on deaf 
ears. When eornered, he only argues more, digging his own grave. Onee 
he has made the other person feel inseeure and inferior in his beliefs, the 
eloquenee of Socrates could not save the situation. 
It is not simply a question of avoiding an argument with those who 
stand above you. We all believe we are masters in the realm of opinions 
and reasoning. You must be careful, then: Learn to demonstrate the cor­
rectness of your ideas indirectly. 
OBSER VA NC E OF THE LAW 
In 1502, in Florenee, Italy, an enormous block of marble stood in the 
works department of the church of Santa Maria deI Fiore. It had once been 
a magnificent piece of raw stone, but an unskillful sculptor had mistakenly 
bored a hole through it where there should have been a figure's legs, gen­
erally mutilating it. Piero Soderini, Florence's mayor, had contemplated 
trying to save the block by eommissioning Leonardo da Vinci to work on 
it, or some other master, but had given up, since everyone agreed that the 
stone had been ruined. So, despite the money that had been wasted on it, it 
gathered dust in the dark halls of the church. 
This was where things stood until some Florentine friends of the great 
Michelangelo decided to write to the artist, then living in Rome. He alone, 
they said, could do something with the marble, which was still magnificent 
raw material . Michelangelo traveled to Florence, examined the stone, and 
eame to the conclusion that he could in fact carve a fine figure from it, by 
adapting the pose to the way the rock had been mutilate d. Soderini argued 
that this was a waste of time- nobody could salvage such a disaster-but 
he finally agreed to let the artist work on it. Michelangelo decided he 
would depict a young David, sling in hand. 
Weeks later, as Michelangelo was putting the final touch es on the 
statue, Soderini entered the studio. Fancying hirnself a bit of a connoisseur, 
he studied the huge work, and told Michelangelo that while he thought it 
was magnificent, the nose, he judged, was too big. Michelangelo realized 
that Soderini was standing in a place right under the giant figure and did 
not have the proper perspeetive. Without a word, he gestured for Soderini 
to follow hirn up the scaffolding. Reaching the nose, he picked up his 
ehisel, as well as a bit of marble dust that lay on the planks. With Soderini 
just a few feet below hirn on the scaffolding, Michelangelo started to tap 
lightly with the ehisel, letting the bits of dust he had gathered in his hand to 
fall little by little. He actually did nothing to change the nose, but gave 
every appearance of working on it. Mter a few minutes of this charade he 
stood aside: "Look at it now." "I like it better," replied Soderini, "you've 
made it come alive." dogs. lIe ofJ,'red Ihis

When Apries had been 
deposed in the way I 
have described, Amasis 
came to the throne. He 
belonged to the district 
of Sais and was a 
native of the town 
cal/ed Siuph. At first 
the Egyptians were 
inclined to be contemp­
tuous, and did not 
think much of him 
because ofhis humble 
and undistinguished 
origin; but later on he 
cleverly brought them 
to heel, without having 
recourse to harsh 
measures. 
Amongst his innumer­
able treasures, he had a 
gold footbath, whieh he 
and his guests used on 
occasion to wash their 
feet in. This he broke 
up, and with the mate­
rial had a statue made 
to one of the gods, 
which he then set up in 
what he thought the 
most suitable spot in 
the city. The Egyptians 
constantly eoming 
upon the statue, treated 
it with profound re ver­
enee, and as soon as 
Amasis heard of the 
effeet it had upon them, 
he cal/ed a meeting and 
revealed the fact that 
the deeply revered 
statue was unce a foot­
bath, which they 
washed their feet and 
pissed and vomited in. 
He went on to say that 
his own case was much 
the same, in that on ce 
he had been only an 
ordinary person and 
was now their king; so 
that just as they had 
come to revere the 
transformed footbath, 
so they had better pay 
72 LAW 9 Interpretation 
Michelangelo knew that by changing the shape of the nose he might ruin 
the entire sculptu re. Yet Soderini was a patron who prided hirnself on his 
aesthetic judgment. To offend such a man by arguing would not only gain 
Michelangelo nothing, it would put future commissions in jeop ardy. 
Michelangelo was too clever to argue. His solution was to change 
Soderini 's perspe ctive (literally bringing hirn closer to the no se) without 
making hirn reaHze that this was the cause of bis misp erception. 
Fortunately for posterity, Michelangelo found a way to keep the per­
f�ction of the statue intact while at the same time making Soderini believe 
he had improved it. Such is the double power of winning through actions 
rather than argum ent: No one is off ended, and your point is proven. 
KEYS TO POWER 
In the realm of power you must leam to judge your moves by their long­
term effects on other people. The problem in trying to prove a point or 
gain a victory through argument is that in the end you can never be certain 
how it aff ects the people you're arguing with: They may appear to agree 
with you politely, but inside they may resent you. Or perhaps something 
you said inadvertently even off ended them-words have that insidious 
ability to be interpreted according to the other person's mood and insec uri­
ties. Even the best argument has no solid foundation, for we have all come 
to distrust the slippery nature of words. And days after agreeing with some­
one, we often revert to our old opinion out of sheer habit. 
Understand this: Wo rds are a dime a dozen. Everyone knows that in 
the heat of an argument, we will all say anything to support our cause. We 
will quote the Bible, refer to unverifiable statistics. Who can be persuaded 
by bags of air like that? Action and demonstration are much more power­
ful and meaningful. They are there, before our eyes, for us to se�"Yes, 
now the statue's no se does look just right. " There are no offensive words, 
no poss ibility of misinterpretat ion. No one can argue with ademonstrated 
proof. As Baltasar Graciän remarks, "The truth is generally seen, rarely 
heard." 
Sir Christopher Wren was Englan d's version of the Rena issance man. 
He had mastered the sciences of mathematics, astronomy, physics, and 
physiology. Yet during bis extremely long career as Englan d's most cele­
brated archite ct he was often told by his patrons to make impractical 
changes in his designs . Never once did he argue or offend. He had other 
ways of proving his point. 
In 1688 Wren desig ned a magnificent town hall for the city of West­
minster. The mayor, however, was not satisfied; in fact he was nervous. He 
told Wren he was afraid the second floor was not seeure, and that it could 
all come crashing down on his office on the first floor. He demanded that 
Wren add two stone columns for extra support. Wren, the consummate en­
gineer, knew that these columns would serve no purpose, and that the 
mayor's fears were baseless. But build them he did, and the mayor was 
grateful. It was only years later that workmen on a high scaffold saw that 
the columns stopped just short of the ceiling. 
They were dumm ies. But both men got what they wanted: The mayor 
could relax, and Wren knew posterity would understand that his original 
design worked and the columns were unnecessa ry. 
The power of demonstrating your idea is that your opponents do not 
get defensive, and are therefore more open to persuasion. Making them lit­
erally and physically feel your meaning is infinitely more powerful than ar­
gument. 
A heckler once interru pted Nikita Khrushchev in the middle of a 
speech in which he was denouncing the crimes of Stalin. "Y ou were a col­
league of Stalin's," the heckler yelled, "why didn't you stop hirn then?" 
Khrushschev apparently could not see the heckler and barked out, "Who 
said that?" No hand went up. No one moved a muscle. After a few seconds 
of tense silen ce, Khrushchev finally said in a quiet voice, "Now you know 
why I didn't stop hirn." Instead of just arguing that anyone facing Stalin 
was afraid, knowing that the slightest sign of rebellion would mean certain 
death, he had made them feel what it was like to face Stalin-had made 
them feel the paranoia, the fear of speaking up, the terror of confronting 
the leader, in this case Khrushchev. The demonstration was visceral and no 
more argument was necessary. 
The most powerful persuasion goes beyond action into symbol. The 
power of a symbol-a flag, a mythic story, a monument to some emotional 
event-is that everyone understands you without anything being said. In 
1975, when Henry Kissinger was engaged in some frustrating negotiations 
with the Israelis over the return of part of the Sinai desert that they had 
seized in the 1967 war, he suddenly broke off a tense meeting and decided 
to do some sight-seeing. He paid a visit to the ruins of the ancient fortress 
of Masada, known to all Israelis as the place where seven hundred J ewish 
warriors committed mass suicide in A.D. 73 rather than give in to the 
Roman troops besieging them. The Israelis instantly underst ood the mes­
sage of Kissing er's visit: He was indirectly accusing them of courting mass 
suicide. Although the visit did not by itself change their minds, it made 
them think far more seriously than any direct warning would have. Sym­
bols like this one carry great emotional significan ce. 
When aiming for power, or trying to conserve it, always look for the 
indirect route. And also choose your battles carefully. If it does not matter 
in the long run whether the other person agrees with you-or if time and 
their own experience will make them understand what you mean-then it 
is best not even to bother with a demonstrat ion. Save your energy and 
walkaway. honor and respeet to 
him, tao. In this way 
the Egyptians were 
persuaded to aceept 
him as their master.

REVE RSAL 
Verbal argument has one vital use in the realm of power: To distract and 
cover your tracks when you are practicing deception or are caught in a He. 
In such cases it is to your advantage to argue with all the conviction you 
can muster. Draw the other person into an argument to distract them from 
your deceptive move. When caught in a He, the more emotional and cer­
tain you appear, the less Hkely it seems that you are lying. 
This technique has saved the hide of many a con artist. Once Count 
Victor Lustig, swindler par excellence, had sold dozens of suckers around 
the country a phony box with which he claimed to be able to copy money. 
Discovering their mistake, the suckers generally chose not to go the police, 
rather than risk the embarrassment of publicity. But one Sheri ff Richards, 
of Remsen County, Oklahoma, was not the kind of man to accept being 
conned out of $10,000, and one moming he tracked Lustig down to a hotel 
in Chicago. 
Lustig heard a knock on the door. When he opened it he was looking 
down the barrel of a gun . "What seems to be the problem ?" he calmly 
asked. "You son of a bitch," yelled the sheriff, "1'm going to kill you. You 
conned me with that damn box of yours!" Lustig feigned confusion. "You 
mean it's not working?" he asked. "You know it's not working, " replied the 
sheriff. "But that's impossible," said Lustig. "There 's no way it couldn't be 
working. Did you operate it proper ly?" "I did exactly what you told me to 
do," said the sheriff. "No, you must have done something wrong, " said 
Lustig. The argument went in circles. The barrel ofthe gun was gently low­
ered. 
Lustig next went to phase two in the argument tactic: He poured out a 
whole bunch of technical gobbledygook about the box's operation, com­
pletely beguiling the sheriff, who now appeared less sure of himself and ar­
gued less forcefully. "Look," said Lustig, "1'11 give you your money back 
right now. 1'11 also give you written instructions on how to work the ma­
chine and 1'11 come out to Oklahoma to make sure it's working properly. 
There's no way you can lose on that." The sheriff reluctantly agreed. To 
satisfy him tota1ly, Lustig took out a hundred one-hundred-dollar bills and 
gave them to him, telling him to relax and have a fun weekend in Chicago. 
Calmer and a little confused, the sheriff finally left. Over the next few days 
Lustig checked the paper every moming. He finally found what he was 
looking for: A short article reporting Sheriff Richar ds's arrest, trial, and 
conviction for passing counte rfeit notes. Lustig had won the argument; the 
sheriff never bothered hirn again.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW 
Born in Limerick, Ireland, in 1818, Marie Gilbert came to Paris in the 
1840s to make her fortune as a dancer and performer. Taking the name 
Lola Montez (her mother was of distant Spanish descent), she claimed to 
be a flamenco dancer from Spain. By 1845 her career was languishing, and 
to survive she became a courtesan-quickly one of the more successful in 
Paris. 
Only one man could salvage Lola's dancing career: Alexandre Du­
jarier, owner of the newspaper with the largest circulation in France, and 
also the newspaper's drama critic. She decided to woo and conquer hirn. 
Investigating his habits, she discovered that he went riding every morning. 
An excellent horsewoman herself, she rode out one moming and "acciden­
talIy" ran into hirn. Soon they were riding together every day. A few weeks 
later Lola moved into his apartment. 
For a while the two were happy together. With Dujarier's help, Lola 
began to revive her dancing career. Despite the risk to his social standing, 
Dujarier told friends he would marry her in the spring. (Lola had never 
told hirn that she had eloped at age nineteen with an Englishman, and was 
stilliegally married.) Although Dujarier was deeply in love, rns life started 
to slide downhill. 
His fortunes in business changed and influential friends began to avoid 
hirn. One night Dujarier was invited to a party, attended by some of the 
wealthiest young men in Paris. Lola wanted to go too but he would not 
allow it. They had their first quarrel, and Dujarier attended the party by 
hirnself. There, hopelessly drunk, he insulted an influential drama critic, 
Jean-Baptiste Rosemond de Beauvalion, perhaps because of something the 
critic had said about Lola. The following morning Beauvalion challenged 
hirn to a duel. Beauvalion was one of the best pistol shots in France. Du­
jarier tried to apologize, but the duel took place, and he was shot and 
killed. Thus ended the life of one of the most promising young men of 
Paris society. Devastated, Lola left Paris. 
In 1846 Lola Montez found herself in Munich, where she decided to 
woo and conquer King Ludwig of Bavaria. The best way to Ludwig, she 
discovered, was through his aide-de-camp, Count Otto von Rechberg, a 
man with a fondness for pretty girls. One day when the count was break­
fasting at an outdoor cafe, Lola rode by on her horse, was "accidentally" 
thrown from the saddle, and landed at Rechberg's feet. The count rushed 
to help her and was enchanted. He promised to introduce her to Ludwig. 
Rechberg arranged an audience with the king for Lola, but when she 
arrived in the anteroom, she could hear the king saying he was too busy to 
meet a favor-seeking stranger. Lola pushed aside the sentries and entered 
his roorn anyway. In the process, the front of her dress somehow got tom 
(perhaps by her, perhaps by one of the sentries), and to the astonishment of 
all, most especially the king, her bare breasts were brazenly exposed. Lola 
was granted her audience with Ludwig. Fifty-five hours later she made her 
debut on the Bavarian stage; the reviews were terrible, but that did not stop 
Ludwig from arranging more performan ces. Tm: ,1 T .\\1) TiIL

78 LAW 10 Ludwig was, in his own words, "bewitc hed" by Lola. He started 
to appear in public with her on his arm, and then he bought and furnished 
an apartment for her on one of Munich's most fashionable boulevards. Al­
though he had been known as amiser, and was not given to flights of 
fancy, he started to shower Lola with gifts and to write poetry for her. Now 
his favored mistress, she catapulted to farne and fortune ovemight. 
Lola began to lose her sense of proportion. One day when she was out 
riding, an elderly man rode ahead of her, a bit too slowly for her liking. 
Unable to pass him, she began to slash hirn with her riding crop. On an­
other occasion she took her dog, unleashed, out for a stroll. The dog at­
tacked a passerby, but instead of helping the man get the dog away, she 
whipped hirn with the leash. Incidents like this infuriated the stolid citizens 
of Bavaria, but Ludwig stood by Lola and even had her naturalized as a 
Bavarian cit izen. The king's entourage tried to wake hirn to the dangers of 
the affair, but those who criticized Lola were surnmarily fired. 
While Bavarians who had loved their king now outwardly disre­
spected hirn, Lola was made a countess, had a new palace built for herself, 
and began to dabble in politics, advising Ludwig on policy. She was the 
most powernd force in the kingdom. Her influence in the king's cabinet 
continued to grow, and she treated the other ministers with disdain. As a 
result, riots broke out throughout the realm. A once peaceful land was vir­
tually in the grip of civil war, and students everywhere were chanting, 
''Raus mit Lola!" 
By February of 1848, Ludwig was finally unable to withstand the pres­
sure. With great sadness he ordered Lola to leave Bavaria immediately. 
She left, but not until she was paid off. For the next five weeks the Bavari­
ans' wrath was tumed against their formerly beloved king. In March of that 
year he was forced to abdicate. 
Lola Montez moved to England. More than anything she needed re­
spectability, and despite being marrie d (she still had not arrange d a divorce 
from the Englishman she had wed years before), she set her sights on 
George Trafford Heald, a promising young army officer who was the son of 
an influential barrister. Although he was ten years younger than Lola, and 
could have chosen a wife among the prettiest and wealthiest young girls of 
English society, Heald fell under her speIl. They were married in 1849. 
Soon arrested on the charge of bigamy, she skipped bail, and she and 
Heald made their way to Spain. They quarreled horribly and on one occa­
sion Lola slashed him with a knife. Finally, she drove him away. Retuming 
to England, he found he had lost his position in the army. Ostracized from 
English society, he moved to Portugal, where he lived in poverty. After a 
few months his short life ended in a boating accident. 
A few years later the man who published Lola Montez' s autobiogra­
phy went bankrupt 
In 1853 Lola moved to Califomia, where she met and married a man 
named Pat Hull. Their relationship was as stormy as all the others, and she 
left Hull for another man. He took to drink and fell into a deep depression 
that lasted until he died, four years later, still a relatively young man. 
At the age of forty-one, Lola gave away her clothes and finery and 
turned to God. She toured America, lecturing on religious topics, dressed 
in white and wearing a halolike white headgear. She died two years later, in 
1861. 
Interpretation 
Lola Montez attracted men with her wiles, but her power over them went 
beyond the sexual . It was through the force of her character that she kept 
her lovers enthrall ed. Men were sucked into the maelstrom she churned up 
around her. They feIt confused, upset, but the strength of the emotions she 
stirred also made them feel more alive. 
As is often the case with infection, the problems would only arise over 
time. Lola's inherent instability would begin to get under her lovers' skin. 
They would find themselves drawn into her problems, but their emotional 
attac hment to her would make them want to help her. This was the crucial 
point of the diseas e--for Lola Montez could not be helped. Her problems 
were too deep. Once the lover identified with them, he was lost. He would 
find hirnself embroiled in quarre Is. The infection would spread to his fam­
ily and friends, or, in the case of Ludwig, to an entire nation. The only so­
lution would be to cut her off, or suffer an eventual colla pse. 
The inf ecting-character type is not restricted to women; it has nothing 
to do with gender. It sterns from an inward instability that radiates outward, 
drawing dis aster upon itself. There is almost adesire to destroy and unset­
tle. You could spend a lifetime studying the pathology of infecting charac­
ters, but don't waste your tim e--just learn the lesson. When you suspect 
you are in the presence of an infector, don't argue, don't try to help, don't 
pass the person on to your friends, or you will become enmes hed. Flee the 
infector's presence or suffer the consequences. 
Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look. He thinks too much ... .

change their patterns, but more often than not it is their patterns that end 
up getting inside and changing uso The reason is simple--humans are ex­

80 LAW 10 ing power because their characters and emotions are so inten se. They often 
present themselves as victims, making it difficult, at first, to see their mis­
eries as self- inflicted. Before you realize the real nature of their problems 
you have been infected by them. 
Understand this: In the game of power, the people you associa te with 
are critic al. The risk of associa ting with infectors is that you will waste valu­
able time and energy trying to free yourself. Through a kind of guilt by as­
sociation, you will also suffer in the eyes of others. Never underestimate the 
dangers of infe ction. 
There are many kinds of infector to be aware of, but one of the most 
insidious is the suff erer from chronic dissatisf action. Cassius, the Roman 
conspirator agai nstJulius Caesar, had the discontent that comes from deep 
envy. He simply could not endure the presence of anyone of greater talent. 
Probably because Caesar sensed the man's intermina ble soumess, he 
passed hirn up for the position of first praetorship, and gave the position to 
Brutus instead. Cassius brooded and broorl.ed, his hatred for Caesar be­
coming pathological. Brutus himself, a devoted republican, disliked Cae­
sar's dictat orship ; had he had the patience to wait, he would have become 
the first man in Rome after Caesar's death, and could have undone the evil 
that the leader had wrought. But Cassius infected hirn with his own rancor, 
bending his ear daily with tales of Caesar's evil. He finally won Brutus over 
to the conspiracy. It was the beginning of a great tragedy. How many mis­
fortunes could have been avoided had Brutus learned to fear the power of 
infection. 
There is only one solution to infection: quarantine. But by the time 
you recognize the problem it is often too late. A Lola Montez overw helms 
you with her forceful person ality. Cassius intri gues you with his confiding 
nature and the depth of his feelings. How can you protect yourself against 
such insidious virus es? The answer lies in judging people on the effects 
they have on the world and not on the reasons they give for their prob-

tor; learn to see the discontent in their eye. Most important of all, do not 
take pity. Do not enmesh yourself in trying to help. The infector will re­
main uncha nged, but you will be unhin ged. 
The other side of infection is equally valid, and perhaps more readily 
underst ood: There are people who attr act happin ess to themselves by their 
good cheer, natural buoyancy, and intelli gence. They are a source of plea­
sure, and you must associate with them to share in the prosper ity they draw 
upon themselves. 
This applies to more than good cheer and success: All positive quali­
ties can infect uso Talleyrand had many strange and intimidating traits, but 
most agreed that he surpassed all Frenchmen in graciousness, aristocratic 
charm, and wit. Indeed he came from one of the oldest noble families in 
the country, and despite his belief in democracy and the French Republic, 
he retained his courtly manners. His contemporary Napoleon was in many 
ways the opposit e--a peasant from Corsica, tacitum and ungracious, even 
violent. 
There was no one Na poleon admired more than Talleyrand. He en­
vied his minister's way with people, his wit and his ability to c.l,arm 
women, and as best he could, he kept Talleyrand around him, hoping to 
soak up the culture he lacked. There is no doubt that Napoleon changed as 
his rule cvntinued. Many of the rough edges were smoothed by his con­
staut association with Talleyrand . 
Use the positive side of this emotional osmosis to advantage. If, for ex­
ample, you are miserly by nature, you will never go beyond a certain limit; 
only generous souls attain greatness. Associate with the generous, then, 
and they will infect you, opening up everything that is tight and restricted 
in you. If you are gloomy, gravitate to the cheerful. If you are prone to iso­
lation, force yourself to befriend the gregarious. Never associate with those 
who share your defects-they will reinforce everything that holds you 
back. Only create associations with positive affinities. Make this a rule of 
life and you will benefit more than from all the therapy in the world. 
REVERSAL Authority: Recognize the fortu­
nate so that you may choose 
their company, and the unf ortu­
nate so that you may avoid 
them. Misfortune is usually the 
crime of folly, and among those 
who suf fer from it there is no 
malady more contagious: Never 
open your door to the least of 
misfortunes, for, if you do, many 
others will follow in its train .... 
Do not die of another's misery. 
(Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) 
This law admits of no reversal. Its application is universal. There is nothing 
to be gained by associating with those who inf ect you with their misery; 
there is only power and good fortune to be obtained by associating with 
the fortunate . Ignore this law at your peril.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW 
Sometime in the Middle Ages, a mercena ry soldier (a condottiere), whose 
name has not been recorded, saved the town of Siena from a foreign ag­
gressor. How could the good citizens of Siena reward hirn? No amount of 
money or honor could possibly compare in value to the preservation of a 
city's liberty. The citizens thought of making the mercenary the lord of the 
city, but even that, they decided, wasn't recompense enough. At last one of 
them stood before the assembly called to debate this matter and said, "Let 
us kill hirn and then worship hirn as our patron saint." And so they did. 
The Count of Carmagnola was ene of the bravest and most successful 
of all the condottieri. In 1442, late in his life, he was in the employ of the city 
of Venice, which was in the midst of a long war with Florence. The count 
was suddenly recalled to Venice. A favorite of the people, he was received 
there with all kinds of honor and splendor. That evening he was to dine 
with the doge hirnself, in the doge's palace. On the way into the palace, 
however, he noticed that the guard was leading hirn in a different direction 
from usual. Crossing the famous Bridge of Sighs, he suddenly realized 
where they were taking him-to the dunge on. He was convicted on a 
trumped-up charge and the next day in the Piazza San Marco, before a 
horrified crowd who could not understand how his fate had changed so 
drastically, he was beheaded. 
Interpretation 
Many of the great condottieri of Renaissance Italy suffered the same fate as 
the patron saint of Siena and the Count of Carmagno la: They won battle 
after battle for their employers only to find themselves banished, impris­
oned, or executed. The problem was not ingratit ude; it was that there were 
so many other condottieri as able and valiant as they were. They were re­
placeable. Nothing was lost by killing them. Meanwhi le, the older among 
them had grown powerful themselve s, and wanted more and more money 
for their services. How much better, then, to do away with them and hire a 
younge r, cheaper mercenary. That was the fate of the Count of Carma­
gnola, who had started to act impudently and independe ntly. He had taken 
his power for granted without making sure that he was truly indispensable. 
Such is the fate (to a less violent degree, one hopes) of those who do 
not make others dependent on them. Sooner or later someone comes along 
who can do the job as weIl as they can-someone younger, fresher, less ex­
pensive, less threatening. 
Be the only one who can do what you do, and make the fate of those who 
hire you so entwin ed with yours that they cannot possibly get rid of you. 
Otherwise you will someday be forced to cross your own Bridge of Sighs.

84 LAW 11 around hirn, he decided that the side to ally hirnself with was not the par­
liament's liberals or conservatives, not any particular minister, and cer­
tainly not the people. It was with the king, Frederick William IV. This was 
an odd choice to say the least, for Frederick was at a low point of his power. 
A weak, indecisive man, he consis tently gave in to the liberals in parlia­
ment; in fact he was spineless, and stood for much that Bismarck disliked, 
personally and politically. Yet Bismarck courted Frederick night and day. 
When other deputies attacked the king for his many inept moves, only Bis­
marck stood by hirn. 
Finally, it all paid off: In 1851 Bismarck was made a minister in the 
king's ca))inet. Now he went to work. Time and again he forced the king's 
hand, getting rum to build up the military, to stand up to the liberals, to do 
exactly as Bismarck wished. He worked on Frederick's insecurity about his 
manliness, challenging rum to be firm and to mle with pride. And he 
slowly restored the king's powers until the monarchy was once again the 
most powernd force in Prussia. 
When Frederick died, in 1861, his brother William assumed the 
throne. William disliked Bismarck intensely and had no intention of keep­
ing hirn around. But he also inherited the same situation his brother had: 
enernies galore, who wanted to rubble his power away. He actually consid­
ered abdicating, feeling he lacked the strength to deal with this dangerous 
and precarious position. But Bismarck insinuated hirnself once again. He 
stood by the new king, gave hirn strength, and urged hirn into firm and de­
cisive action. The king grew dependent on Bismarck's strong-arm tactics to 
keep his enemies at bay, and despite his antipathy toward the man, he soon 
made rum his prime minister. The two quarreled often over policy­
Bismarck was much more conservative-but the king understood his own 
dependency. Whenever the prime minister threatened to resign, the king 
gave in to rum, time after time. It was in fact Bismarck who set state policy. 
Years later, Bismarck's actions as Prussia's prime minister led the vari­
ous German state� to be united into one country. Now Bismarck finagled 
the king into letting hirnself be crowned emperor of Germany. Yet it was 
really Bismarck who had reached the heights of power. As right-hand man 
to the emperor, and as imperial chancellor and knighted prince, he pulled 
all the levers. 
Interpretation 
Most young and ambitious politicians looking out on the politicallandscape 
of 1840s Germany would have tried to build a power base among those 
with the most power. Bismarck saw different. Joirung forces with the pow­
ernd can be foolish: They will swallow you up, just as the doge of Venice 
swallowed up the Count of Carmagnola. No one will come to depend on 
you if they are already strong. If you are ambitious, it is much wiser to seek 
out weak mlers or masters with whom you can create a relationsrup of de­
pendency. You become their strength, their intelligence, their spine. What 
power you hold! If they got rid of you the whole edifice would collapse. 
Necessity mIes the world. People rarely act unless compelled to. If you 
create no need for yourse lf, then you will be done away with at first oppor­
tunity. If, on the other hand, you understand the Laws of Power and make 
others depend on you for their welfare, if you can counteract their weak­
ness with your own "iron and blood," in Bismarck's phrase, then you will 
sUlvive your masters as Bismarck did. You will have all the benefits of 
power without the thoms that come from being a master. 
Thus a wise prince will think 0/ ways to keep his citizens 0/ every sart 
and under every circumstance dependent on the state and on him; 
and then they will always be trustworthy. 
Niccolo Machia velli, 1469-1527 
KEYS TO POWER 
The ultimate power is the power to get people to do as you wish. When you 
can do this without having to force people or hurt them, when they will­
ingly grant you what you desire, then your power is untouchab le. The best 
way to achieve this position is to create a relationship of dependence. The 
master requires your services; he is weak, or unable to function without 
you; you have enmeshed yourself in his work so deeply that doing away 
with you would bring hirn great difficulty, or at least would mean valuable 
time lost in training another to replace you. Once such a relationship is es­
tablished you have the upper hand, the leverage to make the master do as 
you wish. It is the classic case of the man behind the throne, the servant of 
the king who actually controls the king. Bismarck did not have to bully ei­

that unless he got what he wanted he would walk away, leaving the king to

Do not be one of the many who mistakenly believe that the ultimate 
form of power is independence. Power involves a relationship between 
people; you will always need others as allies, pawns, or even as weak mas­
ters who serve as your front. The completely independent man would live 
in a cabin in the woods-he would have the freedom to come and go as he 
pleased, but he would have no power. The best you can hope for is that 
others will grow so dependent on you that you enjoy a kind of reverse in­
depende nce: Their need for you frees you. 
Louis XI (1423-1483), the great Spider King of France, had a weak­
ness for astrology. He kept a court astrologer whom he admired, until one 
day the man predicted that a lady of the court would die within eight days. 
When the prophecy came true, Louis was terrified, thinking that either the 
man had murdered the woman to prove his accuracy or that he was so 
versed in his science that his powers threatened Louis hirnself. In either 
case he had to be killed. 
One evening Louis summoned the astrologer to his room, high in the 
castle. Before the man arrived, the king told his servants that when he gave Tm: EL\I-TBI ': E \\1>

and hurl him to the ground, hundreds of feet below. 
The astrologer so on arrive d, but before giving the signal, Louis de-­
cided to ask him one last question: "Y ou claim to understand astrology and 
to know the fate of others, so tell me what your fate will be and how long 
you have to live." 
"I shall die just three days before Your Majesty," the astrologer replied. 
The king's signal was never given. The man's life was spared. The Spider 
King not only protected bis astrologer for as long as he was alive, he lav­
ished him with gifts and had him tended by the finest court doctor s. 
The astrologer survived Louis by several years, disproving his power 
of prophecy but proving his mastery of power. 
This is the model: Make others dependent on you. To get rid of you 
might spell disaster, even death, and your master dares not tempt fate by 
finding out. There are many ways to obtain such ap osition. Foremost 
among them is to possess a talent and crea tive skill that simply cannot be 
repla ced. 
During the Renaissance, the major obstacle to a painter's success was 
finding the right patron. Michelangelo did this better than anyone else: His 
patron was Pope Julius H. But he and the pope quarreled over the building 
of the pope's marble tomb , and Michelangelo left Rome in disgust. To the 
amazement of those in the pope's circle, not only did the pope not fire him, 
he sought him out and in his own haughty way begged the artist to stay. 
Michelange lo, he knew, could find another patron, but he could never find 
another Michelan gelo. 
You do not have to have the talent of a Michelan gelo; you do have to 
have a skill that sets you apart from the crowd. You should create a situa­
tion in which you can always latch on to another master or patron but your 
master cannot easily find another servant with your particular talent. And 
if, in reality, you are not actually indispensable, you must find a way to 
make it look as if you are. Having the appearance of specialized knowledge 
and skill gives you leeway in your ability to deceive those above you into 
thinking they cannot do without you. Real dependence on your master' s 
part, however, leaves him more vulnerable to you than the faked variety, 
and it is always within your power to make your skill indisp ensa ble. 
This is what is meant by the intertwining of fate s: Like creeping ivy, 
you have wrapp ed yourself around the source of power, so that it would 
cause great trauma to cut you away. And you do not neces sarily have to en­
twine yourself around the master ; another person will do, as long as he or 
she too is indispensable in the chain. 
One day Harry Cohn, president of Columbia Picture s, was visited in 
his office by a gloomy group of his executiv es. It was 1951, when the witch­
hunt against Communists in Holl ywood, carried on by the U.S. Cong ress's 
House Un-American Activit ies Commit tee, was at its height. The execu­
tives had bad news: One of their employ ees, the screenwriter John Howard 
Lawson, had been sing led out as a Communist. They had to get rid of him 
right away or suffer the wrath of the committe e. 
Harry Cohn was no bleeding-heart liberal; in fact, he had always been 
a die-hard Republican. 
His favorite politician was Benito Mussolini, whom he had once vis­
ited, and whose framed photo hung on his wall. If there was someone he 
hated Cohn would call him a "Communist bastard ." But to the executives' 
amazement Cohn told them he would not fire Lawson. He did not keep the 
screenwriter on because he was a good writer-th ere were many good 
writers in Hollywo od. He kept hirn because of achain of dependence: 
Lawson was Humphrey Bogart's writer and Bogart was Columbia's star. If 
Cohn messed with Lawson he would ruin an immensely profitable rela­
tionship . That was worth more than the terrible publicity brought to hirn 
by his defiance of the committe e. 
Henry Kissinger managed to survive the many bloodlettings that went 
on in the Nixon White House not because he was the best diplomat Nixon 
could find-th ere were other fine negotiators-and not because the two 
men got along so well: They did not. Nor did they share their beliefs and 
politics. Kissinger survived because he entrenched hirnself in so many 
areas of the political structure that to do away with hirn would lead to 
chaos. Michelange lo's power was intensive, depending on one skilI, his abil­
ity as an artist; Kissinger's was extensive. He got hirnself involved in so 
many aspects and departments of the administration that his involvement 
became a card in his hand. It also made hirn many allies. If you can 
arrange such a position for yourself , getting rid of you becomes 
dangerous-all sorts of interdependencies will unravel . Still, the intensive 
form of power provides more freedom than the extensive, because those 
who have it depend on no particular master, or particular position of 
power, for their security. 
To make others dependent on you, one route to take is the secret­
intelligence tactic. By knowing other people's secrets, by holding informa­
tion that they wouldn't want broadcast, you seal your fate with theirs. You 
are untouc hable. Ministers of secret police have held this position through­
out the ages: They can make or break a king, or, as in the case of J. Edgar 
Hoover, a president. But the role is so full of insecurities and paranoia that 
the power it provides almost cancels itself out. You cannot rest at ease, and 
what good is power if it brings you no peace? 
One last waming: Do not imagine that your master's dependence on 
you will make him love you. In fact, he may resent and fear you. But, as 
Machia velli said, it is better to be feared than loved. Fear you can control; 
love, never. Depending on an emotion as subtle and changea ble as love or 
friendship will only make you insecure. Better to have others depend on 
you out of fear of the consequences of losing you than out of love of your 
company.

REVERSAL Authority : Make people depend on 
you. More is to be gained from 
such dependence than courtesy. He 
who has slaked his thirst, immedi­
ately turns his back on the well, 
no longer needing it. When depen­
dence disappears, so does civility 
and decency, and then respect. 
The first lesson which experience 
should te ach you is to keep hope 
alive but never satisfied, keeping 
even a royal patron ever in need of 
you. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) 
The weakness of making others depend on you is that you are in some 
measure dependent on them. But trying to move beyond that point means 
getting rid of those above you-it means standing alone, depending on no 
one. Such is the monopolistic drive of aJ. P. Morgan or aJohn D. Rocke­
feller-to drive out all competition, to be in complete control. If you can 
corner the market, so much the better. 
No such independence comes without a price. You are forced to isolate 
yourself. Monopolies often turn inward and destroy themselves from the in­
ternal pressure. They also stir up powernd resentment, making their ene­
mies bond together to fight them. The drive for complete control is often 
ruinous and fruitless. Interdependence remains the law, independence a 
rare and often fatal exception. Better to place yourself in a position of mu­
tual dependence, then, and to follow this critical law rather than look for its 
reversal. You will not have the unbearable pressure ofbeing on top, and the 
master above you will in essence be your slave, for he will depend on you.

90 LAW 12 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 
Sometime in 1926, a tall, dapperly dressed man paid a visit to Al Capone, 
the most feared gangster of his time. Speaking with an elegant Continental 
accent, the man introduced hirnself as Count Victor Lustig. He promised 
that if Capone gave hirn $50,000 he could double it. Capone had more 
than enough funds to cover the "investment, " but he wasn't in the habit of 
entrusting large sums to total strange rs. He looked the count over: Some­
thing about the man was different-his classy style, his manner-and so 
Capone decided to play along. He counted out the bills persona lly and 
handed them to Lustig. "Okay, Count, " said Capone. "Double it in sixty 
days like you said." Lustig left with the money, put it in a safe-deposit box 
in Chicago, then headed to New York, where he had several other money­
making schemes in progress. 
The $50,000 remained in the bank box untouc hed. Lustig made no ef­
fort to double it. Two months later he retumed to Chicago, took the money 
from the box, and paid Capone another visit. He looked at the gangste r's 
stony-f aced bodyguards, smiled apologetically, and said, "Please accept my 
profound regrets, Mr. Capone. l'm sorry to report that the plan failed ... 1 
failed." 
Capone slowly stood up. He glowered at Lustig, debating which part 
of the river to throw hirn in. But the count reached into his coat pocket, 
withdrew the $50,000, and placed it on the desk. "Here, sir, is your money, 
to the penny. Again, my sincere apolog ies. This is most embarrassing. 
Things didn't work out the way 1 thought they would. 1 would have loved 
to have doubled your money for you and for myself-Lord knows 1 need 
it-but the plan just didn't materializ e." 
Capone sagged back into his chair, confused. "I know you're a con 
man, Count, " said Capone. "I knew it the moment you walked in here. 1 
expected either one hundred thousand dollars or nothing. But this . .. get­
ting my money back ... well." "Again my apolog ies, Mr. Capone," said 
Lustig, as he picked up his hat and began to leave. "My God! You're hon­
est!" yelled Capone. "If you're on the spot, here's five to help you along." 
He counted out five one-thousand-dollar bills out of the $50,000. The 
count seemed stunned, bowed deeply, mumbled his thanks, and left, tak­
ing the money. 
The $5,000 was what Lustig had been after all along. 
Interpretation 
Count Victor Lustig, a man who spoke several languages and prided him­
self on his refinement and culture, was one of the great con artists of mod­
em times. He was known for his audacity, his fearlessness, and, most 
important, his knowledge of human psychology. He could size up a man in 
minute s, discovering his wea knesses, and he had radar for sucke rs. Lustig 
knew that most men build up defenses against crooks and other trouble­
makers . The con artist's job is to bring those def enses down. 
One sure way to do this is through an act of apparent sincerity and 
honesty. Who will distrust a person literally caught in the act of being hon-
est? Lustig used selective honesty many times, but with Capone he went a 
step further. No normal con man would have dared such a con; he would 
have chosen his suckers for their meekness, for that look about them that 
says they will take their medicine without complaint. Con Capone and you 
would spend the rest of your life (whatever remained of it) afraid. But 
Lustig underst ood that a man like Capone spends his life rrlistrusting oth­
ers. No one around hirn is honest or generous, and being so much in the 
company of wolves is exhausting, even depressing. A man like Capone 
yearns to be the recipient of an honest or generous gesture, to feel that not 
everyone has an angle or is out to rob hirn. 
Lustig's act of selective honesty disarmed Capone because it was so 
unexpected. A con artist loves conflicting emotions like these, since the 
person caught up in them is so easily distracted and deceived. 
Do not shy away from practicing this law on the Capones of the world. 
With a well-timed gesture of honesty or generosity, you will have the most 
brutal and cynical beast in the kingdom eating out of your hand. 
Everything turns gray when I don 't have at least one mark on the horizon. 
Life then seems empty and depressing. I cannot understand honest men. 
They lead desperate lives, full of boredom.

KEYS TO POWER 
The essence of deception is distraction. Distracting the people you want to 
deceive gives you the time and space to do something they won't notice, 
An act of kind ness, generosity, or honesty is often the most powerful form 
of distraction because it disarms other people's suspicions, It turns them 
into children, eagerly lapping up any kind of affectiona te gesture. 
In ancient China this was called "giving before you take"-the giving 
makes it hard for the other person to notice the taking. It is a device with 
infinite practical uses. Brazenly taking something from someone is danger­
ous, even for the powerful. The victim will plot revenge , It is also danger­
ous simply to ask for what you need, no matter how politely: Unless the 
other person sees some gain for themselves, they may come to resent your 
neediness. Learn to give before you take. It softens the ground, takes the 
bite out of a future request, or simply creates a distraction. And the giving 
can take many forms: an actual gift, a generous act, a kind favor, an "hon­
est" admission-what ever it takes, 
Selective honesty is best employed on your first encounter with some­
one. We are all creatures of habit, and our first impressions last a long time. 
If someone believes you are honest at the start of your relationship it takes 
a lot to convince them otherw ise. This gives you room to maneuver . 
Jay Gould, like Al Capone, was a man who distrusted everyone. 
By the time he was thirty-three he was already a multimillionaire, 
mostly through deception and strong-arming. In the late 1860s, Gould in­
vested heavily in the Erle Railroad, then discovered that the market had 
LAW 12 91 
92 LAW 12 been flooded with a vast amount of phony stock certificates for the com­
pany. He stood to lose a fortune and to suff er a lot of embarr assment. 
In the midst ofthis crlsis, a man named LordJohn Gordon-Gordon of­
fered to help. Gordo n-Gordon, a Scottish lord, had apparendy made a 
small fortune investing in railroads. 
By hirlng some handwriting experts · Gordon-Gordon was able to 
prove to Gould that the culprlts for the phony stock certificates were actu­
ally several top executives with the Erle Railroad itself. Gould was grateful. 
Gordon-Gordon then proposed that he and Gould join forces to buy up a 
controlling int erest in Erle. Gould agre ed. For a while the venture ap­
peared to prosper. The two men were now good friends, and every time 
Gordon-Gordon came to Gould asking for money to buy more stock, 
Gould gave it to him. In 1873, however, Gord on-Gordon suddenly 
dump ed all of his stock, making a fortune but drastically lowering the value 
of Gould's own holdings. Then he disappea red from sight. 
Upon investigation, Gould found out that Gord on-Gordon's real name 
was John Crowning sfield, and that he was the bastard son of a merchant 
seaman and a London barmaid. There had been many clues before then 
that Gordon-Gordon was a con man, but his initial act of honesty and sup­
port had so blinded Gould that it took the loss of milli ons for hirn to see 
through the scheme. 
A single act of honesty is often not enough. What is required is a repu­
tation for honesty, built on a serles of acts--but these can be quite inconse­
quential. Once this reputation is esta blished, as with first impr essions, it is 
hard to shake. 
In ancient China, Duke Wu of CMng decided it was time to take over 
the increasingly powerful kingdom of Hu. Telling no one of his plan, he 
mar ried his daughter to Hu' s roler. He then called a council and asked his 
ministers, "I am considering a military campaign. Which country should 
we invade ?" As he had expected, one of his ministers replied, "Hu should 
be invade d." The duke seemed angry, and said, "Hu is a sister state now. 
Why do you suggest invadi ng her?" He had the minister execute d for his 
impolitic remark. The ruler of Hu heard about this, and consid erlng other 
tokens of W u's honesty and the marriage with his daughter, he took no pre­
cautions to defend hirnself from Cheng. A few weeks later, Cheng forces 
swept through Hu and took the country, never to relinquish it. 
Honesty is one of the best ways to disarm the wary, but it is not the 
only one. Any kind of noble, apparendy selfless act will serve. Perhaps the 
best such act, though, is one of generosity. Few people can resist a gUt, even 
from the most hardened enemy, which is why it is often the perfect way to 
disarm people. A gift brings out the child in us, instandy lowerlng our de­
fenses. Although we often view other people's actions in the most cynical 
light, we rarely see the Machiavellian element of a gift, which quite often 
hides ulterlor motive s. A gift is the perfect object in which to hide a decep­
tive move. 
Over three thousand years ago the ancient Greeks traveled across the 
sea to recapture the beautiful Helen, stolen away from them by Paris, and 
to destroy Paris's city, Troy. The siege lasted ten years, many heroes died, 
yet neither side had come elose to victory. One day, the prophet Calchas 
assembled the Greeks. 
"Stop battering away at these walls!" he told them. "You must find 
some other way, some ruse. We cannot take 
Troy by force alone. We I mag e: T h e must find some cunning 
stratag ern." The cun- Trojan Horse. ning Greek leader 
Odysseus then came up Y 0 u r g u i lei s with the idea of building 
a giant wooden horse, hidden inside hiding soldiers inside it, 
then offering it to the a magnif icent Trojans as a gift. 
Neoptolemus, son of gift that proves Achilles, was disgusted 
with this idea; it was irresistible to unma nly. Better for 
thousands to die on the YOUf opponent. battlefield than to gain 
victory so deceitfully. The walls open. But the soldiers, faced 
with a choice between Once inside, another ten years of 
manlin ess, honor, and wreak havoc . death, on the one hand 
and a quick victory on the other, chose the 
horse, which was promptly built. The trick was successful and Troy fell. 
One gift did more for the Greek cause than ten years of fighting. 
Selective kindness should also be part of your arsenal of deception. For 
years the ancient Romans had besieged the city of the Faliscans, always un­
successfully. One day, however, when the Roman general Camillus was 
encamped outside the city, he suddenly saw a man leading some children 
toward hirn. The man was a Faliscan teacher, and the children, it turned 
out, were the sons and daughters of the noblest and wealthie st citizens of 
the town. On the pretense of taking these chil dren out for a walk, he had 
led them straight to the Romans, offering them as hostages in hopes of in­
gratiating hirnself with Camillus, the city's enemy. 
Camillus did not take the children hostage. He stripped the teacher, 
tied his hands behind his back, gave each child a rod, and let them whip 
him all the way back to the city. The gesture had an immediate effect on 
the Faliscans. Had Camillus used the children as hostages, some in the city 
would have voted to surrender. And even if the Faliscans had gone on 
fighting, their resistance would have been halfhearte d. Camill us's refusal to 
take advantage of the situation broke down the Faliscans' resistance, and 
they surrendered. The general had calculated correctly. And in any case he 
had had nothing to lose: He knew that the ho stage ploy would not have 
ended the war, at least not right away. By tuming the situation around, he 
earned his enemy's trust and respect, disarming them. Selective kindness 
will often break down even the most stubborn foe: Aiming right for the 
heart, it corrodes the will to fight back. 
Rememb er: By playing on people's emotions, calculated acts of kind­
ness can turn a Capone into a gullible child. As with any emotional ap­
proach, the tactic must be practiced with caution: If people see through it, 
their disappointed feelings of gratitude and warmth will become the most 
violent hatred and distrust. Unless you can make the gesture seem sincere 
and heartfelt, do not play with fire.

Count Lustig, pulling the biggest con of his career, was about to sell 
the Eiffel Tower to an unsuspecting industrialist who believed the govern­
ment was auctioning it off for scrap metal. The industrialist was prepared 
to hand over a huge sum of money to Lustig, who had successfully imper­
sonated a government official. At the last minute, however, the mark was 
suspicious. Something about Lustig bothered hirn. At the meeting in which 
he was to hand over the money, Lustig sensed his sudden distrust. 
Leaning over to the industrialist, Lustig explained, in a low whisper, 
how low his salary was, how difficult his finances were, on and on. After a 
few minutes of this, the industrialist realized that Lustig was asking for a 
bribe. For the first time he relaxed. Now he knew he could trust Lustig: 
Since all government officials were dishonest, Lustig had to be real. The 
man forked over the money. By acting dishonest, Lustig seemed the real 
McCoy. In this case selective honesty would have had the opposite effect. 
As the French diplomat Talleyrand grew older, his reputation as a mas­
ter liar and deceiver spread. At the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815), he 
would spin fabulous stories and make impossible remarks to people who 
knew he had to be lying. His dishonesty had no purpose except to cloak 
the moments when he really was deceiving them. One day, for example, 
among friends, Talleyrand said with apparent sincerity, "In business one 
ought to show one's hand." No one who heard him could believe their 
ears: A man who never once in his life had shown his cards was telling 
other people to show theirs. Tactics like this made it impossible to distin­
guish Talleyrand's real deceptions from his fake ones. By embracing his 
reputation for dishonesty, he preserved his ability to deceive. 
Nothing in the realm of power is set in stone. Overt decepti veness will 
sometimes cover YOUf tracks, even making you admired for the honesty of 
your dishonesty.

SIXTH CENTURY B.C. 
96 LAW 13 TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW 
In the early fourteenth century, a young man named Castruccio Castracani 
rose from the rank of common soldier to become lord of the great city of 
Lucca, Italy. One of the most powerful families in the city, the Poggios, 
had been instrumental in his climb (which succeeded through treachery 
and bloodshed), but after he came to power, they came to feel he had for­
gotten them. His ambition outweighed any gratitude he feh. In 1325, while 
Castruccio was away fighting Lucca's main rival, Florence, the Poggios 
conspired with other noble families in the city to rid themselves of this 
troublesome and ambitious prince. 
Mounting an insurrection, the plotters attacked and murdered the gov­
emor whom Castruccio had left behind to rule the city. Riots broke out, 
and the Castruccio supporters and the Poggio supporters were poised to do 
battle. At the height of the tension, however, Stefano di Poggio, the oldest 
member of the family, interv ened, and made both sides lay down their 
arms. 
A peaceful man, Stefano had not taken part in the conspiracy. He had 
told his family it would end in a useless bloodbath. Now he insisted he 
should intercede on the family's behalf and persuade Castruccio to listen to 
their complaints and satisfy their demands. Stefano was the oldest and wis­
est member of the clan, and his family agreed to put their trust in his diplo­
macy rather than in their weapons. 
When news of the rebellion reached Castruccio, he hurried back to 
Lucca. By the time he arrived, however, the fighting had ceased, through 
Stefano's agency, and he was surprised by the city's calm and peace. Ste­
fano di Poggio had imagined that Castruccio would be grateful to him for 
his part in quelling the rebellion, so he paid the prince a visit. He explained 
how he had brought peace, then begged for Castr uccio's mercy. He said 
that the rebels in his family were young and impetuous, hungry for power 
yet inexperienced; he recalled his farnily's past generosity to Castruccio. 
For an these reasons, he said, the great prince should pardon the Poggios 
and listen to their complaints. This, he said, was the only just thing to do, 
since the family had willingly laid down their arms and had always sup­
ported him. 
Castruccio listened patiently. He seemed not the slightest bit angry or 
resentful. Instead, he told Stefano to rest assured that justice would prevail, 
and he asked him to bring his entire family to the palace to talk over their 
grievances and come to an agreement. As they took leave of one another, 
Castruccio said he thanked God for the chance he had been given to show 
his clemency and kindness. That evening the entire Poggio family came to 
the palace. Castruccio immediately had them imprisoned and a few days 
later all were executed, including Stefano. 
Interpretation 
Stefano di Poggio is the embodiment of all those who believe that the jus­
tice and nobility of their cause will prevail. Certainly appeals to justice and 
gratitude have occasionally succeeded in the past, but more often than not 
they have had dire consequence s, especially in dealings with the Castruc­
cios of the world. Stefano knew that the prince had risen to power through 
treachery and ruthlessness. This was a man, after all, who had put a elose 
and devoted friend to death. When Castruccio was told that it had been a 
terrible wrong to kill such an old friend, he replied that he had executed 
not an old friend but a new enemy. 
A man like Castruccio knows only force and self-interest. When the re­
bellion began, to end it and place oneself at his mercy was the most dan­
gerous possible move. Even once Stefano di Poggio had made that fatal 
mistake, however, he still had options: He could have offered money to 
Castruccio, could have made promises for the future, could have pointed 
out what the Poggios could still contribute to Castruccio's power-their in­
fluence with the most influential families of Rome, for example, and the 
great marriage they could have brokered. 
Instead Stefano brought up the past, and debts that carried no obliga­
tion. Not only is a man not obliged to be grateful, gratitude is often a terri­
ble burden that he gladly discards. And in this case Castruccio rid himself 
ofhis obligations to the Poggios by eliminating the Poggios. 
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 
In 433 B.C., just before the Peloponnesian War, the island of Corcyra (later 
called Corfu) and the Greek city-state of Corinth stood on the brink of con­
flict. Both parties sent ambassadors to Athens to try to win over the Atheni­
ans to their side. The stakes were high, since whoever had Athens on his 
side was sure to win. And whoever won the war would certainly give the 
defeated side no mercy. 
Corcyra spoke first. Its ambassador began by admitting that the island 
had never helped Athens before, and in fact had allied itself with Athens's 
enemies. There were no ties of friendship or gratitude between Corcyra 
and Athens. Yes, the ambassador admitted, he had come to Athens now 
out of fear and concern for Corcyra' s safety. The only thing he could offer 
was an alliance of mutual interests. Corcyra had a navy only surpassed in 
size and strength by Athens's own; an alliance between the two states 
would create a formidable force, one that could intimidate the riyal state of 
Sparta. That, unfortunately, was all Corcyra had to offer. 
The represen tative from Corinth then gave a brilliant, passionate 
speech, in sharp contrast to the dry, colorless approach of the Corcyran. 
He talked of everything Corinth had done for Athens in the past. He asked 
how it would look to Athens's other allies if the city put an agreement with 
a former enemy over one with a present friend, one that had served 
Athens's interest loyally: Perhaps those allies would break their agreements 
with Athens if they saw that their loyalty was not valued. He referred to 
Hellenic law, and the need to repay Corinth for all its good deeds. He fi­
nally went on to list the many services Corinth had performed for Athens, 
and the importance of showing gratitude to one's friends. 
After the speech, the Athenians debated the issue in an assembly. On Most men are so thor· 
oughly subjective that 
nothing real/y interests 
them but themselves. 
They always think of 
their own case as soon 
as ever any remark is 
made, and their whole

and absorbed by the 
merest chance refer­
ence to anything which 
affects them persona /ly, 
be it never so remote.

98 LAW 13 the second round, they voted overwhelmingly to ally with Corcyra and 
drop Corinth. 
Interpretation 
History has remembered the Athenians nobly, but they were the preemi­
nent realists of classical Greece. With them, all the rhetoric, all the emo­
tional appeals in the world, could not match a good pragmatic argument, 
especially one that added to their power. 
What the Corinthian ambassador did not realize was that his refer­
ences to Corinth's past generosity to Athens only irritated the Athenians, 
subtly asking them to feel guilty and putting them under obligation. The 
Athenians couldn't care less about past favors and friendly feelings. At the 
same time, they knew that if their other allies thought them ungrateful for 
abandoning Corinth, these city-states would still be unlikely to break their 
ties to Athens, the preeminent power in Greece. Athens ruled its empire by 
force, and would simply compel any rebellious ally to return to the fold. 
When people choose between talk about the past and talk about the 
future, a pragmatic person will always opt for the future and forget the past. 
As the Corcyrans realized, it is always best to speak pragmatically to a 
pragmatic person. And in the end, most people are in fact pragmatic-they 
will rarely act against their own self-interest. 
It has always been a ruZe that the weak should be subject to the strong; 
and besides, we consider that we are worthy of our power. Up tilZ the 
present moment you, too, used to think that we were; but now, after 
calculating your own interest, you are beginning to talk in terms of right 
and wrong. Considerations of this kind have never yet turned people aside 
from the opportunities of aggrandizement offered by superior strength.

quoted in The Pelo ponnesia n War, Thucydides, c. 465-39 5 B.r;. 
KEYS TO POWER 
In your quest for power, you will constantly find yourself in the position of 
asking for help from those more powerful than you. There is an art to ask­
ing for help, an art that depends on your ability to understand the person 
you are dealing with, and to not confuse your needs with theirs. 
Most people never succeed at this, because they are completely 
trapped in their own wants and desires. They start from the assumption 
that the people they are appealing to have a selfless interest in helping 
them. They talk as if their needs mattered to these people--who probably 
couldn't care less. Sometimes they refer to larger issues: a great cause, or 
grand emotions such as love and gratitude. They go for the big picture 
when simple, everyday realities would have much more appeal. What they 
do not realize is that even the most powerful person is locked inside needs 
of his own, and that if you make no appeal to his self-interest, he merely 
sees you as desperate or, at best, a waste of time. 
In the sixteenth century, Portuguese missionaries tried for years to con­
vert the people of Japan to Cathol icism, while at the same time Portugal 
had a monopoly on trade between Japan and Europe. Although the mis­
sionaries did have some success, they never got far among the ruling elite; 
by the beginning of the seventeenth century, in fact, their proselytizing had 
completely antagonized the Japanese emperor Ieyasu. When the Dutch 
began to arrive in Japan in great numbers, Ieyasu was much relieved. He 
needed Europeans for their know-how in guns and navig ation, and here at 
last were Europeans who cared nothing for spreading religion -the Dutch 
wanted only to trade. Ieyasu swiftly moved to evict the Portugu ese. From 
then on, he would only deal with the practical-minded Dutch. 
Japan and Holland were vastly different cultures, but each shared a 
timeless and universal concern: self-interest. Every person you deal with is 
like another culture, an alien land with a past that has nothing to do with 
yours. Yet you can bypass the differences between you and hirn by appeal­
ing to his self-interest. Do not be subtle: You have valua ble knowledge to 
share, you will fill his coffers with gold, you will make hirn live longer and 
happier. This is a language that all of us speak and understand. 
A key step in the process is to und erstand the other person's psychol­
ogy. Is he vain? Is he concerned about his reputation or his social standing? 
Does he have enemies you could help hirn vanquish ? Is he simply moti­
vated by money and power? 
When the MongoIs invaded China in the twelfth century, they threat­
ened to obliterate a culture that had thrived for over two thousand years. 
Their leader, Genghis Khan, saw nothing in China but a country that 
lacked pasturing for his horses, and he decided to destroy the place, level­
ing all its cities, for "it would be better to exterminate the Chinese and let 
the grass grow." It was not a soldier, a general , or a king who saved the 
Chinese from devastation, but a man named Yelu Ch'u-Ts'ai. A foreigner 
hirnself, Ch'u-Ts'ai had come to appreciate the superiority of Chinese cul­
ture. He managed to make hirnself a trusted adviser to Genghis Khan, and 
persuaded hirn that he would reap rich es out of the place if, instead of de­
stroying it, he simply taxed everyone who lived there. Khan saw the wis­
dom in this and did as Ch'u-Ts'ai advised. 
When Khan took the city of Kaifeng, after a long siege, and decided to 
massacre its inhabitants (as he had in other cities that had resisted hirn), 
Ch'u-Ts'ai told hirn that the finest craftsmen and engineers in China had 
fled to Kaifeng, and it would be better to put them to use. Kaifeng was 
spared. Never before had Genghis Khan shown such mercy, but then it 
really wasn't mercy that saved Kaifeng. Ch'u-Ts'ai knew Khan weIl. He was 
a barbaric peasant who cared nothing for culture, or indeed for anything 
other than warf are and practical results. Ch'u-Ts'ai chose to appeal to the 
only emotion that would work on such a man: greed. 
Self-interest is the lever that will move people. Once you make them 
see how you can in some way meet their needs or advance their cause, 
their resistance to your requests for help will magically fall away. At each 
step on the way to acquiring power, you must train yourself to think your 
LAW 13 99 
100 LAW 13 way inside the other person's mind, to see their needs and interests, to get 
rid of the screen of your own feelings that obscure the truth. Master this art 
and there will be no limits to what you can accomplish.

REVERSAL 
Some people will see an appeal to their self-interest as ugly and ig noble. 
They actually prefer to be able to exercise charity, mercy, and justice, 
which are their ways of feeling superior to you: When you beg them for 
help, you emphasize their power and position. They are strang enough to 
need nothing from you except the chance to feel superior. This is the wine 
that intoxicates them. They are dying to fund your project, to introduce 
you to powerful people-provided, of course, that all this is done in public, 
and for a good cause (usually the more public, the better). Not everyone, 
then, can be approached through cynical self-interest. Same people will be 
put off by it, because they don't want to seem to be motivated by such 
things. They need opportunities to display their good he art. 
Da not be shy. Give them that opporttinity. It's not as if you are con­
ning them by asking for help-it is really their pleasure to give, and to be 
seen giving. You must distinguish the differences among powerful people 
and figure out what makes them tick. When they ooze greed, da not appeal 
to their charity. When they want to look charitable and noble, da not ap­
peal to their greed.

102 LAW 14 OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW 
Joseph Duveen was undoubtedly the greatest art dealer of his time-from 
1904 to 1940 he almost single-handedly monopolized America's million­
aire art-collecting market. But one prize plum eluded hirn: the industrialist 
Andrew Mellon. Before he died, Duveen was determined to make Mellon 
a dient. 
Duveen's friends said this was an impossible dream. Mellon was a stiff, 
tacitum man. The stories he had heard about the congenial, talkative Du­
veen rubbed hirn the wrong way-he had made it dear he had no desire to 
meet the man. Yet Duveen told his doubting friends, "Not only will Mellon 
buy from me but he will buy only from me." For several years he tracked 
his prey, leaming the man's habits, tastes, phobias. To do this, he secretly 
put several of Mellon's staff on his own payroll, worming valuable informa­
tion out of them. By the time he moved into action, he knew Mellon about 
as well as Mellon's wife did. 
In 1921 Mellon was visiting London, and staying in a palatial suite on 
the third floor of Claridge's Hotel. Duveen booked hirnself into the suite 
just below Mellon's, on the second floor. He had arranged for his valet to 
befriend Mellon's valet, and on the fateful day he had chosen to make his 
move, Mellon's valet told Duveen's valet, who told Duveen, that he had 
just helped Mellon on with his overcoat, and that the industrialist was mak­
ing his way down the corridor to ring for the lift. 
Duveen's valet hurriedly helped Duveen with his own overcoat. Sec­
onds later, Duveen entered the lift, and 10 and behold, there was Mellon. 
"How do you do, Mr. Mellon?" said Duveen, introducing hirnself. "I am on 
my way to the National Gallery to look at some pictures." How uncanny­
that was precisely where Mellon was headed. And so Duveen was able to 
accompany his prey to the one location that would ensure his success. He 
knew Mellon's taste inside and out, and while the two men wandered 
through the museum, he dazzled the magnate with his knowledge . Once 
again quite uncannily, they seemed to have remarkably similar tastes. 
Mellon was pleasantly surprised: This was not the Duveen he had ex­
pected. The man was charming and agreeable, and dearly had exquisite 
taste. When they retumed to New York, Mellon visited Duveen's exdusive 
gallery and fell in love with the collection. Everything, surprisingly enough, 
seemed to be precisely the kind of work he wanted to collect. For the rest 
of his life he was Duveen's best and most generous dient. 
Interpretation 
A man as ambitious and competitive as Joseph Duveen left nothing to 
chance. What's the point of winging it, of just hoping you may be able to 
charm this or that dient? It's like shooting ducks blindfolded. Arm yourself 
with a little knowledge and your aim improves. 
Mellon was the most spectacular of Duveen's catches, but he spied on 
many a millionaire . By secretly putting members of his clients' household 
staffs on his own payroll, he would gain constant access to valuable infor-
mation about their masters' comings and goings, changes in taste, and 
other such tidbits of information that would put hirn a step ahead. A riyal 
of Duveen's who wanted to make Henry Frick a dient noticed that when­
ever he visited this wealthy New Yorker, Duveen was there before hirn, as 
if he had a sixth sense. To other dealers Duveen seemed to be everywhere, 
and to know everything before they did. His powers discouraged and dis­
heartened them, until many simply gave up going after the wealthy dients 
who could make a dealer rich. 
Such is the power of artful spying: It makes you seem all-powerful, 
clairvoyant. Your knowledge of your mark can also make you seem charm­
ing, so well can you anticipate his desires. No one sees the source of your 
power, and what they cannot see they cannot fight. 
Rulers see through spies, as cows through smell, Brahmins through 
scriptures and the rest 01 the people through their normal eyes. 
Kautilya, Indian philosopher, third antury B.C. 
KEYS TO POWER 
In the realm of power, your goal is a degree of control over future events. 
Part of the problem you face, then, is that people won't tell you all their 
thoughts, emotions, and plans. Controlling what they say, they often keep 
the most critical parts of their character hidden-their weaknesses, ulterior 
motives, obsessions. The result is that you cannot predict their moves, and 
are constantly in the dark. The trick is to find a way to probe them, to find 
out their secrets and hidden intentions, without letting them know what 
you are up to. 
This is not as difficult as you might think. A friendly front will let you 
secretly gather information on friends and enemies alike . Let others con­
sult the horoscope, or read tarot cards: You have more concrete me ans of 
seeing into the future. 
The most common way of spying is to use other people, as Duveen 
did. The method is simple, powerful, but risky: You will certainly gather in­
formation, but you have little control over the people who are doing the 
work. Perhaps they will ineptly reveal your spying, or even secretly turn 
against you. It is far better to be the spy yourself, to pose as a friend while 
secretly gathering information. 
The French politician Talleyrand was one of the greatest practitioners 
of this art. He had an uncanny ability to worm secrets out of people in po­
lite conversation. A contemporary of his, Baron de Vitrolles, wrote, "Wit 
and grace marked his conversation. He possessed the art of concealing his 
thoughts or his malice beneath a transparent veil of insinuations, words 
that imply something more than they express. Only when necessary did he 
inject his own personality." The key here is Talleyrand's ability to suppress 
himself in the conversation, to make others talk endlessly about themselves 
and inadvertently reveal their intentions and plans. 
LAW 14 103 
If you have reason to 
suspect that a person is

though you believed 
every word he said. 
This will give him 
courage to go on; he

assertions , and in the 
end betray himself 
Again, ifyou perceive 
that a person is trying 
to conceal something 
from you, but with only 
partial success, look as 
though you did not 
believe him. The oppo­
sition on your part will 
provoke him into lead-
ing out his reserve of 
tYUth and bringing the 
whole force of it to 
hear upon your 
incredulity. 
ARTHUR 
SnlOPFNIIAUER, 
171l8-1 860 
104 LAW 14 Throughout Talleyrand's life, people said he was a superb conversa­
tionalist-yet he actually said very litde. He never talked about his own 
ideas; he got others to reveal theirs. He would organize friendly games of 
charades for foreign diplomats, social gatherings where, however, he 
would carefully weigh their words, cajole confidences out of them, and 
gather information invaluable to his work as France's foreign minister. At 
the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) he did his spying in other ways: He 
would blurt out what seemed to be a secret (actually something he had 
made up), then watch his listeners' reactions. He might tell a gathering of 
diplomats, for instance, that a reliable source had revealed to him that the 
czar of Russia was planning to arrest his top general for treason. By watch­
ing the diplomats' reactions to this made-up story, he would know which 
ones were most excited by the weakening of the Russian army-perhaps 
their goverments had designs on Russia? As Baron von Stetten said, 
"Monsieur Talleyrand fires a pistol into the air to see who will jump out the 
window." 
During social gatherings and innocuous encounters, pay attention. 
This is when people's guards are down. By suppressing your own personal­
ity, you can make them reveal things. The brilliance of the maneuver is 
that they will mistake your interest in them for friendship, so that you not 
only leam, you make allies. 
Nevertheless, you should practice this tactic with caution and care. If 
people begin to suspect you are worming secrets out of them under the 
cover of conversation, they will stricdy avoid you. Emphasize friendly 
chatter, not valuable information. Your search for gems of information can­
not be too obvious, or your probing questions will reveal more about your­
self and your intentions than about the information you hope to find. 
A trick to try in spying comes from La Rochefoucauld, who wrote, 
"Sincerity is found in very few men, and is often the cleverest of ruses-­
one is sincere in order to draw out the confidence and secrets of the other." 
By pretending to bare your heart to another person, in other words, you 
make them more likely to reveal their own secrets. Give them a fals� con­
fession and they will give you areal one. Another trick was identified by 
the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who suggested vehemendy contra­
dicting people you're in conversa tion with as a way of irritating them, stir­
ring them up so that they lose some of the control over their words. In their 
emotional re action they will reveal all kinds of truths about themselves, 
truths you can later use against them. 
Another method of indirect spying is to test people, to lay litde traps 
that make them reveal things about themselves. Chosroes 11, a notoriously 
clever seventh-c entury king of the Persians, had many ways of seeing 
through his subjects without raising suspicion. If he noticed, for instance, 
that two of his courtiers had become particularly friendly, he would call 
one of them aside and say he had information that the other was a traitor, 
and would soon be killed. The king would tell the courtier he trusted him 
more than anyone, and that he must keep this information secret. Then he 
would watch the two men carefully. If he saw that the second courtier had 
not changed in his behavior toward the king, he would conclude that the 
first courtier had kept the secret, and he would quickly promote the man, 
later taking hirn aside to confess, "I meant to kill your friend because of 
certain information that had reached me, but, when 1 investigated the mat­
ter, 1 found it was untrue." If, on the other hand, the second courtier started 
to avoid the king, acting aloof and tense, Chosroes would know that the se­
cret had been revealed. He would ban the second courtier from his court, 
letting hirn know that the whole business had only been a test, but that 
even though the man had done nothing wrong, he could no longer trust 
hirn. The first courtier, however, had revealed a secret, and hirn Chosroes 
would ban from his entire kingdom. 
It may seem an odd form of spying that reveals not empirical informa­
tion but a person's character. Often, however, it is the best way of solving 
problems before they arise. 
By tempting people into certain acts, you leam about their loyalty, 
their honesty, and so on. And this kind of knowledge is often the most 
valuable of all: Armed with it, you can predict their actions in the future.

lations. It must be obtained from men who know the enemy sit­
uation-f rom spies. (Sun-tzu, The Art 0/ War, fourth century B.C.) 
LAW 14 105 
106 LAW 14 REVERSAL 
Information is critical to power, but just as you spy on other people, you 
must be prepared for them to spy on you. One of the most potent weapons 
in the battle for information, then, is giving out false information. As Win­
ston Churchill said, "Truth is so precious that she should always be at­
tended by a bodyguard of lies." You must surround YOUTself with such a 
bodyguard, so that YOUT truth cannot be penetrated. By planting the infor­
mation of YOUT choice, you control the game. 
In 1944 the Nazis' rocket-bomb attacks on London suddenly escalated. 
Over two thousand V-I flying bombs fell on the city, killing more than five 
thousand people and wounding many more. Somehow, however, the Ger­
mans consistently missed their targets. Bombs that were intended for 
Tower Bridge, or Piccadilly, would fall weIl short of the city, landing in the 
less populated suburbs. This was because, in fixing their targets, the Ger­
mans relied on secret agents they had plan ted in England. They did not 
know that these agents had been discovered, and that in their place, 
English-controlled agents were feeding them subtly deceptive information. 
The bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every time 
they fell. By the end of the campaign they were landing on cows in the 
country. By feeding people wrong information, then, you gain a potent ad­
vantage. While spying gives you a third eye, disinformation puts out one of 
your enemy's eyes. A cyclops, he always misses his target.

108 LAW 15 TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW 
No rivalry between leaders is more celebrated in Chinese history than the 
struggle between Hsiang Yu and Liu Pang. These two generals began their 
careers as friends, fighting on the same side. Hsiang Yu came from the no­
bility; large and powerful, given to bouts of violence and temper, a bit dull­
witted, he was yet a mighty warrior who always fought at the head of his 
troops. Liu Pang came from peasant stock. He had never been much of a 
soldier, and preferred women and wine to fighting; in fact, he was some­
thing of a scoundrel. But he was wily, and he had the ability to recognize 
the best strategists, keep them as his advisers, and listen to their advice. He 
had risen in the army through these strengths. 
In 208 B.C., the king of Ch'u sent two massive armies to conquer the 
powerful kingdom of Ch'in. One army went north, under the generalship 
of Sung Yi, with Hsiang Yu second in comma nd; the other, led by Liu 
Pang, headed straight toward Ch'in. The target was the kingdom's splendid 
capital, Hsien-yang. And Hsiang Yu, ever violent and impatient, could not 
stand the idea that Liu Pang would get to Hsien-yang first, and perhaps 
would assurne command of the entire army. 
At one point on the northem front, Hsiang' s commander, Sung Yi, 
hesitated in sending his troops into battle. Furious, Hsiang entered Sung 
Yi's tent, proclaimed hirn a traitor, cut off his head, and assumed sole com­
mand of the army. Without waiting for orders, he left the northem front 
and marched directly on Hsien-yang. He feit certain he was the better sol­
dier and general than Liu, but, to his utter astonishment, his riyal, leading a 
smaller, swifter army, manage d to reach Hsien-yang first. Hsiang had an 
adviser, Fan Tseng, who wamed him, "This village headman [Liu Pang] 
used to be greedy only for riches and women, but since entering the capital 
he has not been led astray by wealth, wine, or sex. That shows he is aiming 
high." 
Fan Tseng urged Hsiang to kill his riyal before it was too late. He told 
the general to invite the wily pe asant to a banquet at their camp outside 
Hsien-yang, and, in the midst of a celebratory sword dance, to have his 
head cut off. The invitation was sent; Liu fell for the trap, and came to the 
banquet. But Hsiang hesitated in ordering the sword dance, and by the 
time he gave the signal, Liu had sensed a trap, and managed to escape. 
"Bah!" cried Fan Tseng in disgust, seeing that Hsiang had botched the plot. 
"One cannot plan with a simplet on. Liu Pang will steal your empire yet 
and make us all his prisoners." 
Realizing his mistake, Hsiang hurriedly marched on Hsien-yang, this 
time determined to hack off his rival's head. Liu was never one to fight 
when the odds were against hirn, and he abandoned the city. Hsiang cap­
tured Hsien-yang, murdered the young prince of Ch'in, and bumed the 
city to the ground. Liu was now Hsiang's bitter enemy, and he pursued 
hirn for many months, finally comering hirn in a walled city. Lacking food, 
his army in disarray, Liu sued for peace. 
Again Fan Tseng wamed Hsiang, "Crush hirn now! If you let hirn go 
again, you will be sorry later." But Hsiang decided to be merciful . He 
wanted to bring Liu back to Ch'u alive, and to force his former friend to ac­
knowledge hirn as master. But Fan proved right: Liu managed to use the 
negotiati ons for his surrender as a distraction, and he escaped with a small 
army. Hsiang, amazed that he had yet again let his riyal slip away, once 
more set out after Liu, this time with such ferocity that he seemed to have 
lost his mind. At one point, having captured Liu's father in battle, Hsiang 
stood the old man up during the fighting and yelled to Liu across the line of 
troops, "Surrender now, or 1 shall boi! your father alive !" Liu calmly an­
swered, "But we are sworn brothers. So my father is your father also. If you 
insist on boiling your own father, send me a bowl of the soup!" Hsiang 
backed down, and the struggle continued. 
A few weeks later, in the thick of the hunt, Hsiang scattered his forces 
unwisely, and in a surprise attack Liu was able to surround his main garri­
son. For the first time the tables were turned. Now it was Hsiang who sued 
for peace. Liu's top adviser urged hirn to destroy Hsiang, crush his army, 
show no mercy. "To let hirn go would be like rearing a tiger-it will devour 
you later," the adviser said. Liu agreed. 
Making a false treaty, he lured Hsiang into relaxing his defense, then 
slaughtered almost all of his army. Hsiang managed to escape. Alone and 
on foot, knowing that Liu had put a bounty on his head, he came upon a 
small group of his own retreating soldiers, and cried out, "I hear Liu Pang 
has offered one thousand pieces of gold and a fief of ten thousand families 
for my head. Let me do you a favor." Then he slit his own throat and died. 
Interpretation 
Hsiang Yu had proven his ruthlessness on many an occasion. He rarely 
hesitated in doing away with a riyal if it served his purposes. But with Liu 
Pang he acted differently. He respected his rival, and did not want to defeat 
hirn through deception; he wanted to prove his superiority on the battle­
field, even to force the clever Liu to surrender and to serve hirn. Every time 
he had his riYal in his hands, something made hirn hesitate-a fatal sympa­
thy with or respect for the man who, after all, had once been a friend and 
comrade in arms. But the moment Hsiang made it clear that he intended to 
do away with Liu, yet failed to accomplish it, he sealed his own doom. Liu 
would not suffer the same hesitation on ce the tables were turned. 
This is the fate that faces all of us when we sympathize with our ene­
mies, when pity, or the hope of reconciliation, makes us pull back from 
doing away with them. We only strengthen their fear and hatred of uso We 
have beaten them, and they are humili ated; yet we nurture these resentful 
vipers who will one day kill uso Power cannot be dealt with this way. It 
must be extermin ated, crushed, and denied the chance to return to haunt 
uso This is all the truer with a former friend who has become an enemy. 
The law governing fatal antagonisms reads: Reconciliation is out of the 
question. Only one side can win, and it must win totally.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 
Wu Chao, born in A.D. 625, was the daughter of a duke, and as a beautiful 
young woman of many charms, she was accordingly attached to the harem 
of Emperor T'ai Tsung. 
The imperial harem was a dangerous place, full of young concubines 
vying to become the emperor's favorite. Wu's beauty and forceful charac­
ter quickly won her this battle, but, knowing that an emperor, like other 
powerful men, is a creature of whim, and that she could easily be replaced, 
she kept her eye on the future. 
Wu managed to seduce the emperor' s dissolute son, Kao Tsung, on the 
only possible occasion when she could find him alone: while he was reliev­
ing himself at the royal urinal. Even so, when the emperor died and Kao 
Tsung took over the throne, she still suffered the fate to which all wives and 
concubines of a deceased emperor were bound by tradition and law: Her 
head shaven, she entered a convent, for what was supposed to be the rest 
of her life. For seven years Wu schemed to escape. By communicating in 
secret with the new emperor, and by befriending his wife, the empress, she 
managed to get a highly unusual royal edict allowing her to return to the 
palace and to the royal harem. Once there, she fawned on the empress, 
while still sleeping with the emperor. The empress did not discourage 
this-she had yet to provide the emperor with an heir, her position was 
vulnerable, and Wu was a valuable ally. 
In 654 Wu Chao gave birth to a child. One day the empress came to 
visit, and as so on as she had left, Wu smothered the newborn-her own 
baby. When the murder was discovered, suspicion immediately fell on the 
empress, who had been on the scene moments earlier, and whose jealous 
nature was known by all. This was precisely Wu's plan. Shortly therea fter, 
the empress was charged with murder and executed. Wu Chao was 
crowned empress in her place. Her new husband, addicted to his life of 
pleasure, gladly gave up the reins of govemment to Wu Chao, who was 
from then on known as Empress Wu. 
Although now in a position of great power, Wu hardly feh secure. 
There were enemies everywhere; she could not let down her guard for one 
moment. Indeed, when she was forty-one, she began to fear that her beau­
tiful young niece was becoming the emperor's favorite. She poisoned the 
woman with a day mixed into her food. In 675 her own son, touted as the 
heir apparent, was poisoned as weIl. The next-eldest son-illegitimate, but 
now the crown prince-was exiled a little later on trumped-up charges. 
And when the emperor died, in 683, Wu managed to have the son after 
that declared unfit for the throne. All this meant that it was her youngest, 
most ineffectual son who finallybecame emperor. In this way she contin­
ued to rule. 
Over the next five years there were innumerable palace coups. All of 
them failed, and all of the conspirators were executed. By 688 there was no 
one left to challenge Wu. She proclaimed herself a divine descendant of 
Buddha, and in 690 her wishes were finally granted: She was named Holy 
and Divine "Emperor" of China. 
Wu became emperor because there was literally nobody left from the 
previous T'ang dynasty. And so she ruled unchallenged, for over a decade 
ofrelative peace. In 705, at the age of eighty, she was forced to abdicate. 
Interpretation 
All who knew Empress Wu remarked on her energy and intelligen ce. At 
the time, there was no glory available for an ambitious woman beyond a 
few years in the imperial harem, then a lifetime walled up in a convent. In 
Wu's gradual but remarkable rise to the top, she was never naive. She 
knew that any hesitation, any momentary weakness, would speIl her end. 
If, every time she got rid of a riyal a new one appeared, the solution was 
simple: She had to crush them all or be killed herself. Other emperors be­
fore her had followed the same path to the top, but Wu-who, as a woman, 
had next to no chance to gain power-had to be more ruthless still. 
Empress Wu's forty-year reign was one of the longest in Chinese his­
tory. Although the story of her bloody rise to power is weIl known, in 
China she is considered one ofthe period's most able and effective rulers. 
A priest asked the dying Spanish statesman and general Ram6n Maria Narvaez 
(1800-1868), "Does your Exceltenc y forgive alt your enemies ?" "[ do not 
have to forgive my enemies, " answe red Narvaez, "[ have had them alt shot. " 
KEYS TO POWER 
It is no accident that the two stories illustrating this law come from China: 
Chinese history abounds with examples of enemies who were left alive and 
retumed to haunt the lenient. "Crush the enemy" is a key strategie tenet of 
Sun-tzu, the fourth-century-B .c. author of The Art ofWar. The idea is simple: 
Your enemies wish you ill. There is nothing they want more than to elimi­
nate you. If, in your struggles with them, you stop halfway or even three 
quarters of the way, out of mercy or hope of reconciliat ion, you only make 
them more determined, more embittered, and they will someday take re­
venge. They may act friendly for the time being, but this is only because 
you have defeated them. They have no choice but to bide their time. 
The solution: Have no mercy. Crush your enemies as totally as they 
LAW 15 111 
112 LAW 15 would crush you. Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for 
from your enemies is their disappeara nce. 
Mao Tse-tung, a devoted reader of Sun-tzu and of Chinese history gen­
erally, knew the importance of this law. In 1934 the Communist leader and 
some 75,000 poorly equipped soldiers fled into the desolate mountains of 
western China to escape Chiang Kai- shek's much larger army, in what has 
since been called the Long March. 
Chiang was determined to eliminate every last Communist, and by a 
few years later Mao had less than 10,000 soldiers left. By 1937, in fact, 
when China was invaded by Japan, Chiang calculated that the Commu­
nists were no longer a threat. He chose to give up the ehase and concen­
trate on the Japanese. Ten years later the Communists had recovered 
enough to rout Chiang's army. Chiang had forgotten the ancient wisdom of 
erushing the enemy; Mao had not. Chiang was pursued until he and his en­
tire army fled to the island of Taiwan. Nothing remains of his regime in 
mainland China to this day. 
The wisdom behind "crushing the enemy" is as ancient as the Bible: 
Its first praetitioner may have been Moses, who learned it from God Him­
self, when He parted the Red Sea for the Jews, then let the water flow back 
over the pursuing Egyptians so that "not so much as one of them re­
mained." When Moses returned from Mount Sinai with the Ten Com­
mandments and found his people worshipping the Golden Calf, he had 
every last offender slaug htered. And just before he died, he told his follow­
ers, finally about to enter the Promised Land, that when they had defeated 
the tribes of Canaan they should "utterly destroy them . . . make no 
eovenant with them, and show no merey to them." 
The goal of total victory is an axiom of modem warfare, and was codi­
fied as such by Carl von Clausewitz, the premier philosopher of war. Ana­
lyzing the campaigns of Napoleon, von Clausewitz wrote, "We do claim 
that direct annihilation of the enemy's forees must always be the dominant 
consideration .... Onee a major victory is achieved there must be no talk of 
rest, of breathing space . . . but only of the pursuit, going for the enemy 
again, seizing his eapital, attacking his reserves and anything else that 
might give his country aid and eomfort." The reason for this is that after 
war come negotiation and the division of territory. If you have only won a 
partial victory, you will inevitably lose in negotiation what you have 
gained by war. 
The solution is simple: Allow your enemies no options. Annihilate 
them and their territory is yours to carve. The goal of power is to control 
your enemies completely, to make them obey your will. You cannot afford 
to go halfway. If they have no options, they will be forced to do your bid­
ding. This law has applieations far beyond the battlefield. Negotiation is the 
insidious viper that will eat away at your vietory, so give your enemies 
nothing to negotiate, no hope, no room to maneuver. They are crushed 
and that is that. 
Realize this: In your struggle for power you will stir up rivalries and 
create enemies. There will be people you cannot win over, who will re­
main your enemies no matter what. But whatever wound you inflicted on 
them, deliberately or not, do not take their hatred personally. Just recog­
nize that there is no possibility of peace between you, especially as long as 
you stay in power. If you let them stick around, they will seek revenge, as 
certainly as night follows day. To wait for them to show their cards is just 
silly; as Empress Wu understood, by then it will be too late. 
Be realistic: With an enemy like this around, you will never be secure. 
Remember the lessons of history, and the wisdom of Moses and Mao: 
Never go halfway. 
It is not, of course, a question of murder, it is a question of banishment. 
Sufficiently weakened and then exiled from your court forever, your ene­
mies are rendered harmless. They have no hope of recovering, insinuating 
themselves and hurting you. And if they cannot be banished, at least un­
derstand that they are plotting against you, and pay no heed to whatever 
friendliness they feign. Your only weapon in such a situation is your own 
wariness. If you cannot banish them immediately, then plot for the best 
time to act. 
Image: A Viper crushed 
beneath your foot but left 
alive, will rear up and bite 
you with a double dose of 
venom. An enemy that is 
left around is like a half­
dead viper that you nurse 
back to health. Time makes 
the venom grow stronger. 
Authority: For it must be 
noted, that men must either be 
caressed or else annihilated; 
they will revenge themselves 
for small injuries, but cannot 
do so for great ones; the injury 
therefore that we do to a man 
must be such that we need not 
fear his vengeance. (Niccolo 
Machiavelli, 1469-1527) 
LAW 15 113 
114 LAW 15 REVERSAL 
This law should very rarely be ignored, but it does sometimes happen that 
it is better to let your enemies destroy themselves, if such a thing is possi­
ble, than to make them suffer by YOUf hand. In warf are, for exa mple, a 
good general knows that if he attacks an army when it is comered, its sol­
diers will fight much more fiercely. It is sometimes better, then, to leave 
them an escape route, a way out. As they retreat, they wear themselves out, 
and are ultiinately more demoralized by the retreat than by any defeat he 
rnight inflict on the battlefield. When you have someone on the ropes, 
then-but only when you are SUfe they have no chance of recove ry-you 
rnight let them hang themsel ves. Let them be the agents of their own de­
struction. The result will be the same, and you won't feel half as bad. 
Finally, sometimes by crushing an enemy, you embitter them so much 
that they spend years and years plotting revenge. The Treaty of Versailles 
had such an effect on the Germa ns. Some would argue that in the long run 
it would be better to show some leniency. The problem is, your leniency 
invol ves another risk-it may embolden the enemy, which still harbors a 
gru dge, but now has some room to operate . It is almost always wiser to 
crush YOUf enemy. If they plot revenge years later, do not let YOUf guard 
down, but simply crush them aga in.

116 LAW 16 TRAN SGR ESSION AND OBSER VA NCE OF THE LAW 
Sir Guillaume de Balaun was a troubadour who roamed the South of 
France in the Middle Ages, going from castle to cast le, reciting poetry, and 
playing the perf ect knight. At the castle of Javiac he met and fell in love 
with the beautiful lady of the house, Madame Guillelma de J aviac, He sang 
her his songs, recited his poetry, played che ss with her, and little by little 
she in turn fell in love with him. Guillaume had a friend, Sir Pierre de Bar­
jac, who traveled with him and who was also received at the castle, And 
Pierre too fell in love with a lady in Javiac, the gracious but temperamental 
Viernetta. 
Then one day Pierre and Viernetta had a violent quarrel. The lady 
dismissed him, and he sought out his friend Guillaume to help heal the 
breach and get him back in her good graces. Guillaume was about to leave 
the castle for a whil e, but on his return, several weeks later, he worked his 
magie, and Pierre and the lady were reconciled. Pierre feit that his love 
had increased tenfold-that there was no stronger love, in fact, than the 
love that follows recon ciliat ion. The stronger and longer the disagreement, 
he told Guilla ume, the sweeter the feeling that comes with peace and 
rapprochement. 
As a troubadour, Sir Guillaume prided himself on experiencing all the 
joys and sorrows of love. On hearing his friend's talk, he too wanted know 
the bliss of recon ciliation after a quarr el. He theref ore feigned great anger 
with Lady Guillelma, stopp ed sending her love letters, and abruptly left the 
castle and stayed away, even during the festivals and hunts. This drove the 
young lady wild. 
Guillelma sent messengers to Guillaume to find out what had hap­
pened, but he turned the messengers away. He thought an this would make 
her angry, forcing him to plead for reconciliation as Pierre had. Instead, 
however, his absence had the opposite effe ct: It made Guillelma love him 
all the more. Now the lady pursued her knight, sending messengers and 
love notes of her own . This was alm ost unheard of-a lady never pursue d 
her troubadour. And Guillaume did not like it. Gui llelma' s forwa rdness 
made him feel she had lost some of her dignity. Not only was he no longer 
sure of his plan, he was no longer sure of his lady. 
Finally, after several months of not hearing from Guillaume, Guillelma 
gave up. She sent him no more messengers, and he began to wonder-per­
haps she was angry ? Perhaps the plan had worked after all? So much the 
better if she was. He would wait no more-it was time to reconcile. So he 
put on his best robe, decked the horse in its fanciest capar ison, chose a 
magnifi cent heImet, and rode off to Javiac. 
On hearing that her beloved had returned, Guillelma rushed to see 
him, knelt before him, dropped her veil to kiss him, and begged forgive­
ness for whatever slight had caused his anger. Imagine his confusion and 
desp air-his plan had failed abysmally. She was not angry, she had never 
been angry, she was only deeper in love, and he would never experience 
the joy of reconciliation after a quarrel. Seeing her now, and still desperate 
to taste that jOY, he decided to try one more time: He drove her away with 
harsh words and threatening gestures. She left, this time vowing never to 
see hirn again. 
The next morning the troubadour regretted what he had done. He 
rode back to Javiac, but the lady would not receive hirn, and ordered her 
servants to chase hirn away, across the drawbridge and over the hill. Guil­
laume fled. Back in his chamber he collapsed and started to cry: He had 
made a terrible mistake. Over the next year, unable to see his lady, he ex­
perienced the absence, the terrible absence, that can only inflame love. He 
wrote one of his most beautiful poems, "My song ascends for mercy pray­
ing." And he sent many letters to Guillelma, explaining what he had done, 
and begging forgiveness. 
After a great deal of this, Lady Guillelma, remembering his beautiful 
songs, his handsome figure, and his skills in dancing and falconry, found 
herself yearning to have hirn back. As penance for his cruelty, she ordered 
hirn to remove the nail from the little finger of his right hand, and to send it 
to her along with a poem describing his miseries. 
He did as she asked. Finally Guillaume de Balaun was able to taste the 
ultimate sensation-a reconciliation even surpassing that of his friend 
Pierre. 
Interpretation 
Trying to discover the joys of reconciliation, Guillaume de Balaun inadver­
tently experienced the truth of the law of absence and presence. At the 
start of an affair, you need to heighten your presence in the eyes of the 
other. If you absent yourself too early, you may be forgotten. But once 
your lover's emotions are engaged, and the feeling of love has crystallized, 
absence inflames and excites. Giving no reason for your absence excites 
even more: The other person assurnes he or she is at fault. While you are 
away, the lover's imagination takes flight, and a stimulated imagination 
cannot help but make love grow stronger. Conversely, the more Guillelma 
pursued Guillaume, the less he loved her-she had become too present, 
too accessible, leaving no room for his imagination and fancy, so that his 
feelings were suffocating. When she finally stopped sending messengers, 
he was able to breathe again, and to return to his plan. 
What withdraws, what becomes scarce, suddenly seems to deserve our 
respect and honor. What stays too long, inundating us with its presence, 
makes us disdain it. In the Middle Ages, ladies were constantly putting 
their knights through trials of love, sending them on some long and ardu­
ous quest-all to create a pattern of absence and presence. Indeed, had 
Guillaume not left his lady in the first place, she might have been forced to 
send hirn away, creating an absence of her own. 
Absence diminishes minor passions and inflames great ones, 
as the wind douses a candle and fans a fire.

118 LAW 16 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 
For many centuries the Assyrians ruled upper Asia with an iron fist. In the 
eighth century B.C., however, the people of Medea (now northwestem 
Iran) revolted against them, and finally broke free. Now the Medes had to 
establish a new govemment. Determined to avoid any form of despotism, 
they refused to give ultimate power to any one man, or to establish a 
monarchy. Without aleader, however, the country soon fell into chaos, 
and fractured into small kingdoms, with village fighting against village . 
In one such village lived a man named Deioces, who began to make a 
name for hirnself for fair dealing and the ability to settle disputes. 
He did this so successfully, in fact, that soon any legal conflict in the 
area was brought to hirn, and his power increased. Throughout the land, 
the law had fallen into disrepute--the judges were corrupt, and no one en­
trusted their cases to the courts any more, resorting to violence instead. 
When news spread of Deioces' wisdom, incorruptibility, and unshakable 
impartiality, Medean villages far and wide tumed to hirn to settle all man­
ner of cases. Soon he became the sole arbiter of justice in the land. 
At the height of his power, Deioces suddenly decided he had had 
enough. He would no longer sit in the chair of judgment, would hear no 
more suits, settle no more disputes between brother and brother, village 
and village . Complaining that he was spending so much time dealing with 
other people's problems that he had neglected his own affairs, he retired. 
The country once again descended into chaos. With the sudden with­
drawal of a powerful arbiter like Deioces, crime increased, and contempt 
for the law was never greater. The Medes held a meeting of all the villages 
to decide how to get out of their predicament. "We cannot continue to live 
in this country under these conditions," said one triballeader. "Let us ap­
point one of our number to rule so that we can live under orderly govem­
ment, rather than losing our hornes altogether in the present chaos." 
And so, despite all that the Medes had suffered under the Assyrian des­
potism, they decided to set up a monarchy and name a king. And the man 
they most wanted to rule, of course, was the fair-minded Deioces. He was 
hard to convince, for he wanted nothing more to do with the villages' in­
fighting and bickering, but the Medes begged and pleaded -without him the 
country had descended into astate of lawlessness. Deioces finally agreed. 
Yet he also imposed condition s. An enormous palace was to be con­
structed for him, he was to be provided with bodyguards, and a capital city 
was to be built from which he could rule. All of this was done, and Deioces 
settled into his palace. In the center of the capital, the palace was sur­
rounded by walls, and completely inaccessible to ordinary people. Deioces 
then established the terms of his rule: Admission to his presence was for­
bidden. Communication with the king was only possible through messen­
gers. No one in the royal court could see him more than once a week, and 
then only by permission. 
Deioces ruled for fifty-three years, extended the Medean empire, and 
established the foundation for what would later be the Persian empire, 
under his great-great-g randson Cyrus. During Deioces' reign, the people's 
respect for hirn gradually tumed into a form of worship : He was not a mere 
mortal, they believed, but the son of a god. 
Interpretati on 
Deioces was a man of great ambition. He determined early on that the 
country needed a strong ruler, and that he was the man for the job. 
In aland plagued with anarchy, the most powerful man is the judge 
and arbiter. So Deioces began his career by making his reputation as a man 
of impeccable fairness. 
At the height of his power as a judge, however, Deioces realized the 
truth of the law of absence and presence: By serving so many clients, he 
had become too noticeable, too available, and had lost the respect he had 
earlier enjoyed. People were taking his services for granted. The only way 
to regain the veneration and power he wanted was to withdraw com­
pletely, and let the Medes taste what life was like without hirn. As he ex­
pected, they came begging for hirn to rule. 
Once Deioces had discovered the truth of this law, he carried it to its 
ultimate realizati on. In the palace his people had built for hirn, none could 
see hirn except a few courtiers, and those only rarely. As Herodotus wrote, 
"There was a risk that if they saw him habitually, it might lead to jealousy 
and resentment, and plots would follow; but if nobody saw hirn, the legend 
would grow that he was a being of a different order from mere men." 
A man said to a Dervish: ""Why do I not see you more often ?" The Dervish 
replied, "Because the words '"Why have you not been to see me?' are 
sweeter to my ear than the words '"Why have you come again?'" 
Mulla Jami, quoted in ldries Shah 's Caravan 01' Dreams, 1968 
KEYS TO POWER 
Everything in the world depends on absence and presence. A strong pres­
ence will draw power and attention to you-you shine more brightly than 
those around you. But a point is inevitably reached where too much pres­
ence creates the opposite effect: The more you are seen and heard from, 
the more your value degrad es. You become a habit. No matter how hard 
you try to be different, subtly, without your knowing why, people respect 
you less and less. At the right moment you must leam to withdraw yourself 
before they unconsciously push you away. It is agame of hide-and-seek. 
The truth of this law can most easily be appreciated in matters of love 
and seduction. In the beginning stages of an affair, the lover's absence stim­
ulates your imagina tion, forming a sort of aura around hirn or her. But this 
aura fades when you know too much- when your imagination no longer 
has room to roam. The loved one becomes a person like anyone else, a 
person whose presence is taken for granted. This is why the seventeenth­
century French courtesan Ninon de Lenclos advised constant feints at with­
drawal from one's lover. "Love never dies of starvation," she wrote, "but 
often of indigestion. " 
LAW 16 119 
120 LAW 16 The moment you allow yourself to be treate d like anyone else, it is too 
late-y ou are swallowed and dige sted. To prevent this you need to starve 
the other person of your presence. Force their respect by threatenir1g them 
with the pos sibility that they will lose you far good; create a pattern of pres­
ence and absence. 
Once you die, everything about you will seem different You will be 
surroun ded by an instant aura of respect. People will remember their criti­
cisms of you, their arguments with you, and will be fille d with regret and 
guilt. They are rnissing a presence that will never return. But you do not 
have to wait until you die: By completely withdrawing for a while, you cre­
ate a kind of death before death. And when you come back, it will be as if 
you had come back from the dead-an air of resurrection will ding to you, 
and people will be reliev ed at your return. This is how Deioces made him­
self king. 
Napoleon was recognizing the law of absence and presence when he 
said, "If I am often seen at the theater, people will cease to notice me." 
Today, in a world inunda ted with presence through the flood of image s, the 
game of withdrawal is all the more powerful. We rarely know when to 
withdraw anymore, and nothing seems private, so we are awed by anyone 
who is able to disa ppear by choic e. Novelists J. D. Salinger and Thomas 
Pynchon have created cultlike followings by knowing when to disappe ar. 
Another, more everyday side of this law, but one that demonstrates 
its truth even further, is the law of scarcity in the science of economics. 
By withdrawi ng something from the market, you create instant value. In 
seventeenth-century Holland, the upper classes wan ted to make the tulip 
more than just a bea utiful flower-they wante d it to be a kind of status sym­
bol. Making the flower scarce, indeed almost impossible to obtain, they 
sparked what was later called tulip omania. A single flower was now worth 
more than its weight in gold. In our own century, similarly , the art dealer 
Joseph Duv een insisted on making the paintings he sold as scarce and rare 
as poss ible. To keep their prices elevated and their status high, he bought up 
whole collections and stored them in his basement. The paintings that he 
sold became more than just paintin gs-- they were felish objects, their value 
increased by their rarity. "You can get all the pictures you want at fifty thou­
sand dollars apiece-that's easy," he once said. "But to get pictures at a 
quarter of a mill ion apiece-that wants doin g!" 
I mag e: 
The Sun. lt can only be 
appreciated by its absence. 
The longer the days of rain, the 
more the sun is craved. But too many 
hot days and the sun overwhelms. 
Learn to keep yourself obscure and 
make people demand your return. 
Extend the law of scarcity to your own skills. Make what you are offer­
ing the world rare and hard to find, and you instantly increase its value. 
There always comes a moment when those in power overstay their 
welcome. We have grown tired of them, lost respect for them; we see them 
as no different from the rest of mankind, which is to say that we see them as 
rather worse, since we inevitably compare their current status in our eyes 
to their former one. There is an art to knowing when to retire. If it is done 
right, you regain the respect you had lost, and retain a part of your power. 
The greatest mler of the sixteenth century was Charles V. King of 
Spain, Hapsburg emperor, he governed an empire that at one point in­
cluded much of Europe and the New World. Yet at the height of his power, 
in 1557, he retired to the monastery of Yuste. All of Europe was captivated 
by his sudden withdrawal; people who had hated and feared hirn suddenly 
called hirn great, and he came to be seen as a saint. In more recent times, 
the film actress Greta Garbo was never more admired than when she re­
tired, in 1941. For some her absence came too soon-she was in her mid­
thirties-but she wisely preferred to leave on her own terms, rather than 
waiting for her audi ence to grow tired of her. 
Make yourself too available and the aura of power you have created 
around yourself will wear away. Turn the game around: Make yourself less 
accessible and you increase the value of your presence. 
Authority: 
Use absence to create 
respect and esteern. If presence 
diminishes farne, absence augments it. 
A man who when absent is regarded as a 
lion becomes when present so me thing com­
mon and ridiculo us. Talents lose their luster 
if we become too familiar with them, for the 
outer shell of the mind is more readily seen 
than its rich inner kernel. Even the outstand-
ing genius makes use of retirement so that 
men rnay honor hirn and so that the 
yearning aroused by his absence 
rnay cause hirn to be esteerned. 
(Baltasar Graciän, 
1601-1658) 
LAW 16 121 
122 LAW 16 REVERSAL 
This law only applies once a certain level of power has been attained. The 
need to withdraw only comes after you have established your presence; 
leave too early and you do not increase YOUf respect, you are simply for­
gotten. When you are first entering onto the world's stage, create an image 
that is recogniza ble, reproducible, and is seen everywh ere. Until that status 
is attained, absence is dangerous-instead of fanning the flarnes, it will ex­
tinguish them. 
In love and seduction, similarly, absence is only effective once you 
have sUfrounded the other with YOUf image, been seen by hirn or her 
everywhe re. Everything must remind YOUf lover of your presence, so that 
when you do choose to be away, the lover will always be thinking of you, 
will always be seeing you in his or her mind's eye. 
Rememb er: In the beginning, make yourself not scarce but om­
nipresent. Only what is seen, appreciated, and loved will be missed in its 
absence.

124 LAW 17 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 
In May of 1972, chess champion Boris Spassky anxiously awaited his riyal 
Bobby Fischer in Reykjavik, Iceland. The two men had been scheduled to 
meet for the World Championship of Chess, but Fischer had not arrived on 
time and the match was on hold. Fischer had problems with the size of the 
prize money, problems with the way the money was to be distributed, 
problems with the logistics of holding the match in Iceland. He might back 
out at any moment. 
Spassky tried to be patient. His Russian bosses feit that Fischer was hu­
miliating him and told him to walk away, but Spassky wanted this match. 
He knew he could destroy Fischer, and nothing was going to spoil the 
greatest victory of his career. "So it seems that all OUT work may come to 
nothing," Spassky told a comrade. "But what can we do? It is Bobby's 
move. If he comes, we play. If he does not come; we do not play. A man 
who is willing to commit suicide has the initiative." 
Fischer finally arrived in Reykjavik, but the problems, and the threat 
of cancellation, continued. He disliked the hall where the match was to be 
fought, he criticized the lighting, he complained about the noise of the 
cameras, he even hated the chairs in which he and Spassky were to sit. 
Now the Soviet Union took the initiative and threatened to withdraw their 
man. 
The bluff apparently worked: After all the weeks of waiting, the end­
less and infuriating negotiations, Fischer agreed to play. Everyone was re­
lieved, no one more than Spassky. But on the day of the official 
introductions, Fischer arrived very late, and on the day when the "Match 
of the Century" was to begin, he was late again. This time, however, the 
consequences would be dire: If he showed up too late he would forfeit the 
first game. What was going on? Was he playing some sort of mind game? 
Or was Bobby Fischer perhaps afraid ofBoris Spassky? It seemed to the as­
sembled grand masters, and to Spassky, that this young kid from Brooklyn 
had a terrible case of the jitters. At 5:09 Fischer showed up, exactly one 
minute before the match was to be canceled. 
The first game of a chess toumament is critical, since it sets the tone for 
the months to come. It is often a slow and quiet struggle, with the two play­
ers preparing themselves for the war and trying to read each other's strate­
gies. This game was different. Fischer made a terrible move early on, 
perhaps the worst of his career, and when Spassky had hirn on the ropes, 
he seemed to give up. Yet Spassky knew that Fischer never gave up. Even 
when facing checkmate, he fought to the bitter end, wearing the opponent 
down. This time, though, he seemed resigned. Then suddenly he broke out 
a bold move that put the room in a buzz. The move shocked Spassky, but 
he recovered and managed to win the game. But no one could figure out 
what Fischer was up to. Had he lost deliberately? Or was he rattled? Unset­
tled? Even, as some thought, insane? 
After his defeat in the first game, Fischer complai ned all the more 
loudly about the room, the cameras, and everything else. He also failed to 
show up on time for the second game. This time the organizers had had 
enough : He was given a forfeit. Now he was down two games to none, a 
position from which no one had ever come back to win a chess champi­
onship. Fischer was clearly unhing ed. Yet in the third game, as all those 
who witnessed it remember, he had a ferocious look in his eye, a look that 
clearly bothered Spassky. And despite the hole he had dug for hirnself, he 
seemed supremely confident. He did make what appeared to be another 
blunder, as he had in the first game-but his cocky air made Spassky smell 
a trap. Yet despite the Russian's suspicions, he could not figure out the trap, 
and before he knew it Fischer had checkmated hirn. In fact Fischer's un­
orthodox tactics had completely unnerved his opponent. At the end of the 
game, Fischer leaped up and rushed out, yelling to his confederates as he 
smashed a fist into his palm, "I'm crushing him with brute force!" 
In the next games Fischer pulled moves that no one had seen from 
hirn before, moves that were not his style. Now Spassky started to make 
blunders. After losing the sixth game, he started to cry. One grand master 
said, "Mter this, Spassky's got to ask hirnself if it's safe to go back to Rus­
sia." After the eighth game Spassky decided he knew what was happening: 
Bobby Fischer was hypnotizing hirn. He decided not to look Fischer in the 
eye; he lost anyway. 
After the fourteenth game he called a staff conference and announ ced, 
"An attempt is being made to control my mind." He wondered whether the 
orange juice they drank at the chess table could have been drugge d. 
Maybe chemicals were being blown into the air. Finally Spassky went pub­
Hc, accusing the Fischer team of putting something in the chairs that was al­
tering Spassky's mind. The KGB went on alert: Boris Spassky was 
embarrassing the Soviet Union! 
The chairs were taken apart and X-rayed. A chemist found nothing 
unusual in them. The only things anyone found anywhere, in fact, were 
two dead flies in a Hghting fixture. Spassky began to complain of hallucina­
tions. He tried to keep playing, but his mind was unraveling. He could not 
go on. On September 2, he resigned. Although still relatively young, he 
never recovered from this defeat. 
Interpretation 
In previous games between Fischer and Spassky, Fischer had not fared 
weIl. Spassky had an uncanny ability to read his opponent's strategy and 
use it against hirn. Adaptable and patient, he would build attacks that would 
defeat not in seven moves but in seventy. He defeated Fischer every time 
they played because he saw much further ahead, and because he was a bril­
Hant psychologist who never lost control. One master said, "He doesn't just 
look for the best move. He looks for the move that will disturb the man he 
is playing." 
Fischer, however, finaHy understood thll;t this was one of the keys to 
Spassky's success: He played on your predictability, defeated you at your 
own game. Everything Fischer did for the champ ionship match was an at-
LAW 17 125 
126 LAW 17 tempt to put the initiative on his side and to keep Spassky off-balance. 
Clearly the endless waiting had an effect on Spassky's psyche. Most power­
ful of all, though, were Fischer' s deliberate blunders and his appearance of 
having no clear strategy. In fact, he was doing everything he could to 
scramble his old patterns, even if it meant losing the first match and forfeit­
ing the second. 
Spassky was known for his sangf roid and levelheadedness, but for the 
first time in his life he could not figure out his opponent. He slowly melted 
down, until at the end he was the one who seemed insane . 
Chess contains the concentrated essence of life: First, because to win 
you have to be supremely patient and farseeing; and second, because the 
game is built on patterns, whole sequences of moves that have been played 
before and will be played again, with slight alterations, in any one match. 
Your opponent analyzes the patterns you are playing and uses them to try 
to fore see your moves. Allowing hirn nothing predictable to base his strat­
egy on gives you a big advantage. In chess as in life, when people cannot 
figure out what you are doing, they are kept in astate of terror-waiting, 
uncertain, confused. 
Life at court is a serious, mela nchol y game of chess, which requires us to draw 
up our pieces and batteries, form a plan, pursue it, parry that of our 
adversary. Sometime s, however, it is better to take risks 
and play the most capr icious, unpred ictable move. 
leall de La Bmyere, 1645-1 696 
KEYS TO POWER 
Nothing is more terrifying than the sudden and unpredicta ble. That is why 
we are so frightened by earthquake s and torna does: We do not know when 
they will strike. Mter one has occurred, we wait in terror for the next one. 
To a lesser degree, this is the effect that unpredictable human behavior has 
on uso 
Animals behave in set patterns, which is why we are able to hunt and 
kill them. Only man has the capacity to consciously alter his behavior, to 
improvise and overcome the weight of routine and habit. Yet most men do 
not realize this power. They prefer the comf orts of routine, of giving in to 
the animal nature that has them repeating the same compulsive actions 
time and time aga in. They do this because it requires no effort, and be­
cause they mistakenly believe that if they do not unsettle others, they will 
be left alone. Understa nd: A person of power instills a kind of fear by delib­
erately unset tling those around hirn to keep the initiative on his side. You 
sometimes need to strike without warning, to make others tremble when 
they least expect it. It is a device that the powerful have used for centuries. 
Filippo Maria, the last of the Visconti dukes of Milan in fifteenth­
cent ury Italy, consciously did the opposite of what everyone expected of 
hirn. For instanc e, he might suddenly shower a courtier with atte ntion, and 
then, once the man had come to expect a promotion to higher office, 
would suddenly start treating hirn with the utmost disdain. Confused, the 
man might leave the court, when the duke would suddenly recall hirn and 
start treating hirn weIl again. Doubly confused, the courtier would wonder 
whether his assumption that he would be promoted had become obvious, 
and offensive, to the duke, and would start to behave as if he no longer ex­
pected such honor. The duke would rebuke hirn for his lack of ambition 
and would send hirn away. 
The secret of dealing with Filippo was simple: Do not presume to 
know what he wants. Do not try to guess what will please hirn. Never inject 
your will; just surrender to his will. Then wait to see what happens. Amidst 
the confusion and uncertainty he created, the duke ruled supreme, unchal­
lenged and at peace. 
Unpredic tability is most often the tactic of the master, but the under­
dog too can use it to great effect. If you find yourself outnumbered or cor­
nered, throw in aseries of unpredictable moves. Your enemies will be so 
confused that they will pull back or make a tactical blunder. 
In the spring of 1862, during the American Civil War, General 
Stonewall Jackson and a force of 4,600 Confederate soldiers were torment­
ing the larger Union forces in the Shenandoah Valley. Meanwhile, not far 
away, General George Brinton McClellan, heading a force of 90,000 
Union soldiers, was marching south from Washington, D.C., to lay siege to 
Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital. As the weeks of the cam­
paign went by, Jackson repeatedly led his soldiers out of the Shenandoah 
Valley, then back to it. 
His movements made no sense. Was he preparing to help defend 
Richmond? Was he marching on Washington, now that McClellan's ab­
sence had left it unprotected? Was he heading north to wreak havoc up 
there? Why was his small force moving in circles? 
Jackson's inexplicable moves made the Union generals delay the 
march on Richmond as they waited to figure out what he was up to. Mean­
while, the South was able to pour reinforcements into the town. A battle 
that could have crushed the Confederacy tumed into a stalemate. Jackson 
used this tactic time and again when facing numerically superior forces. 
"Always mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy, if possible," he said, 
" ... such tactics will win every time and a small army may thus destroy a 
large one." 
This law applies not only to war but to everyday situations. People are 
always trying to read the motives behind your actions and to use your pre­
dictability against you. Throw in a completely inexplicable move and you 
put them on the defensive. Because they do not und erstand you, they are 
unnerved, and in such astate you can easily intimidate them. 
Pablo Picasso once remarked, "The best calculation is the absence of 
calculation. Once you have attained a certain level of recognition, others 
generally figure that when you do something, it's for an intelligent reason. 
So it's really foolish to plot out your movements too carefully in advance. 
You're better off acting capriciously." 
For a while, Picasso worked with the art dealer Paul Rosenberg. At first 
LAW 17 127 
128 LAW 17 he allowed hirn a fair amount of latitude in handling his paintings, then one 
day, for no apparent reason, he told the man he would no longer give hirn 
any work to seIl. As Picasso explained, "Rosenberg would spend the next 
forty-eight hours trying to figure out why. Was I reserving things for some 
other dealer? I'd go on working and sleeping and Rosenberg would spend 
his time figuring. In two days he'd come back, nerves jangled, anxious, say­
ing, 'After all, dear friend, you wouldn't turn me down if I offered you this 
much [naming a substantially higher figure] for those paintings rather than 
the price I've been accustomed to paying you, would you?' " 
Unpredictability is not only a weapon of terror: Scrambling YOUf pat­
terns on a day-to-day basis will cause a stir around you and stimulate inter­
est. People will talk about you, ascribe motives and explanations that have 
nothing to do with the truth, but that keep you constantly in their minds. In 
the end, the more capricious you appear, the more respect you will gamer. 
Only the terminally subordinate act in a predictable manner.

REVERSAL 
Sometim es predictability can work in your favor: By creating a pattern for 
people to be familiar and comfortable with, you can lull them to sleep. 
They have prepared everything according to their preconceived notions 
about you. You can use this in several ways: First, it sets up a smoke screen, 
a comfortable front behind which you can carry on deceptive actions. Sec­
ond, it allows you on rare occasions to do something completely against 
the pattern, unsettling YOUf opponent so deeply he will fall to the ground 
without being pushed. 
In 1974 Muhammad Ali and George Foreman were scheduled to fight 
for the world heavyweight boxing champ ionship. Everyone knew what 
would happen: Big George Foreman would try to land a knockout punch 
while Ali would dance around hirn, wearing hirn out. That was Ali's way of 
fighting, his pattern, and he had not changed it in more than ten years. But 
in this case it seemed to give Foreman the advantage : He had a devastating 
punch, and if he waited, sooner or later Ali would have to come to hirn. 
Ali, the master strategist, had other plans: In press conferences before the 
big fight, he said he was going to change his style and punch it out with 
Foreman. No one, least of all Foreman, believed this for a second. That 
plan would be suicide on Ali's part; he was playing the comedian, as usual. 
Then, before the fight, Ali's trainer loosened the ropes around the ring, 
something a trainer would do if his boxer were intending to slug it out. But 
no one believed this ploy; it had to be a setup. 
To everyone's amazement, Ali did exactly what he had said he would 
do. As Foreman waited for hirn to dance around, Ali went right up to hirn 
and slugged it out. He completely upset his opponent's strategy. At a loss, 
Foreman ended up wearing hirnself out, not by chasing Ali but by throw­
ing punches wildly, and taking more and more counterpunc hes. Finally, 
Ali landed a dramatic right cross that knocked out Foreman. The habit of 
assuming that a person's behavior will fit its previous patterns is so strong 
that not even Ali's announcement of a strategy change was enough to upset 
it. Foreman walked into a trap-the trap he had been told to expect. 
A warning: Unpredictability can work against you sometimes, es­
pecially if you are in a subordinate position. There are times when it is bet­
ter to let people feel comfortable and settled around you than to disturb 
them. Too much unpredictability will be seen as a sign of indecisiven ess, or 
even of some more serious psychic problem. Patterns are powerful, and 
you can terrify people by disrupting them. Such power should only be

The world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere­
everyone has to protect themselves . A fortress seems the 
safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it 
protects you from-it cuts you off from valuable informa­
tion, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better 
to circulate among people, find allies, mingle. You are 
shielded from your enemies by the crowd. 
TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW 
Ch'in Shih Huang Ti, the first emperor of China (221-210 B.C.), was the 
mig htie st man of his day. His empire was vaster and more powernd than 
that of Alexander the Great. He had conquered all of the kingdoms sur­
round ing his own kingdom of Ch'in and unified them into one massive 
realm called China. But in the last years ofhis life, few, if anyone , saw hirn. 
The emperor lived in the most magnificent palace built to that date, in 
the capital of Hsien-y ang. The palace had 270 pavili ons; all of these were 
conn ected by secret underground passageways, allowing the emperor to 
move through the palace without anyone seeing him. He slept in a differ­
ent room every night, and anyone who inadvertently laid eyes on hirn was 
instantly beheaded. Only a handful of men knew his whereabouts, and if 
they revealed it to anyone, they, too, were put to death . 
The first emperor had grown so terrified of human contact that when 
he had to leave the palace he traveled incognito, disguising hirnself care­
fully. On one such trip through the provin ces, he suddenly died. His body 
was borne back to the capital in the emperor's carriage, with a cart packed 
with salted fish trailing behind it to cover up the smell of the rotting 
corpse-no one was to know of his death. He died alone, far from his 
wives, his family, his friends, and his courtiers, accompanied only by a 
minister and a handful of eunuc hs. 
Interpretation 
Shih Huang Ti started off as the king of Ch'in, a fearless warrior of unbri­
dled amb ition. Writers of the time described hirn as a man with "a waspish 
nose, eyes like slits, the voice of a jackal, and the heart of a tiger or wolf. " 
He could be merciful sometimes, but more often he "swallowed men up 
without ascrupIe ." It was through trickery and violence that he conquered 
the provinces surrounding his own and created China, forging a single na­
tion and culture out of many. He broke up the feudal system, and to keep 
an eye on the many members of the royal families that were scattered 
across the realm' s various kingdoms, he moved 120,000 ofthem to the cap­
ital, where he housed the most important courtiers in the vast palace of 
Hsien-yang. He consolidated the many walls on the borders and built them 
into the Great Wall of China . He standardi zed the country's laws, its writ­
ten language, even the size of its cartw heels. 
As part of this process of unification, however, the first emperor out­
lawed the writings and teachings of Confucius, the philosopher whose 
ideas on the moral life had already become virtually a religion in Chinese 
culture. On Shih Huang Ti's order, thousands of books relating to Confu­
cius were burned, and anyone who quoted Confucius was to be beheaded. 
This made many enemies for the emperor, and he grew constantly afraid, 
even paranoid. The executions mounted. A contemporary, the writer Han­
fei-tzu, noted that "Ch'in has been victorious for four generations, yet has 
lived in constant terror and app rehension of destruct ion."

political policies without his approval or even his knowledge; they also 
plotted against hirn. By the end, he was emperor in name only, and was so 
isolated that barely anyone knew he had died. He had probably been poi­
soned by the same scheming ministers who encouraged his isolation. 
That is what isolation brings: Retreat into a fortress and you lose con­
tact with the sources of your power. You lose your ear for what is happen­
ing around you, as weIl as a sense of proportion. Instead of being safer, you 
cut yourself off from the kind of knowledge on which your life depends. 
Never enclose yourself so far from the streets that you cannot hear what is 
happening around you, including the plots against you. 
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 
Louis XIV had the palace of Versailles built for hirn and his court in the 
1660s, and it was like no other royal palace in the world. As in a beehive, 
everything revolved around the royal person. He lived surrounded by the 
nobility, who were allotted apartments nestled around his, their closeness 
to hirn dependent on their rank. The king's bedroom occupied the literal 
center of the palace and was the focus of everyone's attention. Every mom­
ing the king was greeted in this room by a ritual known as the lever. 
At eight A.M., the king's first valet, who slept at the foot of the royal 
bed, would awaken His Majesty. Then pages would open the door and 
admit those who had a function in the lever. The order of their entry was 
precise: First came the king's illegitimate sons and his grandchildren, then 
the princes and princesses of the blood, and then his physician and sur­
geon. There followed the grand officers of the wardrobe, the king's official 
reader, and those in charge of entertaining the king. Next would arrive var­
ious govemment officials, in ascending order of rank. Last but not least 
came those attending the lever by special invitation. By the end of the cere­
mony, the room would be packed with weIl over a hundred royal atten­
dants and visitors. 
The day was organized so that all the palace's energy was directed at 
and passed through the king. Louis was constantly attended by courtiers 
and officials, all asking for his advice and judgment. To all their questions 
he usually replied, "I shall see." 
As Saint-Simon noted, "If he tumed to someone, asked hirn a ques­
tion, made an insignificant remark, the eyes of all present were tumed on 
this person. It was a distinction that was talked of and increased prestige." 
There was no possibility of privacy in the palace, not even for the king­
every room communicated with another, and every hallway led to larger 
rooms where groups of nobles gathered constantly. Everyone's actions 
were interdependent, and nothing and no one passed unnoticed: "The 
king not only saw to it that all the high nobility was present at his court," 
wrote Saint-Simon, "he demanded the same of the minor nobility. At his 
lever and coucher, at his meals, in his gardens of Versailles, he always looked 
about hirn, noticing everything. He was offended if the most distingu ished 
nobles did not live permanently at court, and those who showed them­
selves never or hardly ever, incurred his full displeasure . If one of these de­
sired something, the king would say proudly : 'I do not know hirn,' and the 
judgment was irrevocab le." 
Interpretation 
Louis XIV came to power at the end of a terrible civil war, the Fronde. A 
principal instigator of the war had been the nobility, which deeply resented 
the growing power of the throne and yearned for the days of feudalism, 
when the lords ruled their own fiefdoms and the king had little authority 
over them. The nobles had lost the civil war, but they remained a fractious, 
resentful lot. 
The construction of Versailles, then, was far more than the decadent 
whim of a luxury-loving king. It served a crucial function: The king could 
keep an eye and an ear on everyone and everything around hirn. The 
once proud nobility was reduced to squabbling over the right to help the 
king put on his robes in the morning. There was no possibility here of pri­
vacy-no possibility of isolation. Louis XIV very early grasped the truth 
that for a king to isolate hirnself is gravely dangerou s. In his absence, con­
spiracies will spring up like mushrooms after rain, animosities will crystal­
lize into factions, and rebellion will break out before he has the time to 
react. To combat this, sociability and openness must not only be encour­
aged, they must be formally organized and channeled. 
These conditions at Versailles lasted for Louis's entire reign, some fifty 
years of relative peace and tranquillit y. Through it all, not a pin dropped 
without Louis hearing it. 
Solitude is dang erous to reason, without beingj avorable to virtue .... 
Remember that the solitary mortal is certainl y luxurious, 
probabl y supers titious, and possibl y mad. 
Dr. SamuelJohnson, 1709-1784 
KEYS TO POWER 
Machiavelli makes the argument that in a strictly military sense a fortress is 
invariably amistake. It becomes a symbol of power's isolation, and is an 
easy target for its builders' enemies. Designed to defend you, fortresses ac­
tually cut you off from help and cut into your flexibility. They may appear 
impregna ble, but once you retire to one, everyone knows where you are; 
and a siege does not have to succeed to turn your fortress into a prison. 
With their small and confined spaces, fortresses are also extremely vulner­
able to the plague and contagious diseases. In a strategic sense, the iso­
lation of a fortress provides no protection, and actually creates more 
problems than it solves. was made so near/y to

LAW 18 1.13 
134 LAW 18 Because humans are social creatures by nature, power depends on so­
cial interaction and circulation. To make yourself powerful you must place 
yourself at the center of things, as Louis XIV did at Versailles. All activity 
should revolve around you, and you should be aware of everything hap­
pening on the street, and of anyone who might be hatching plots against 
you. The danger for most people comes when they feel threatened. In such 
times they tend to retreat and elose ranks, to find security in a kind of 
fortress. In doing so, however, they come to rely for information on a 
smaller and smaller cirele, and lose perspective on events around them. 
They lose maneuverability and become easy targets, and their isolation 
makes them paranoid. As in warfare and most games of strategy, isolation 
often precedes defeat and death. 
In moments of uncertainty and danger, you need to fight this desire to 
turn inward. Instead, make yourself more accessible, seek out old allies and 
make new ones, force yourself into more and more different cireles. This 
has been the trick of powerful people for centuries. 
The Roman statesman Cicero was born into the lower nobility, and 
had little chance of power unless he managed to make a place for himself 
among the aristocrats who controlled the city. He succeeded brilliantly, 
identifying everyone with influence and figuring out how they were con­
nected to one another. He mingled everywh ere, knew everyon e, and had 
such a vast network of connections that an enemy here could easily be 
counterb alanced by an ally there. 
The French statesma n Talleyrand played the game the same way. Al­
though he came from one of the oldest aristocratic families in France, he 
made a point of always staying in touch with what was happening in the 
streets of Paris, allowing him to foresee trends and troubles. He even got a 
certain pleasure out of mingling with shady criminal types, who supplied 
him with valuable informat ion. Every time there was a crisis, a transition of 
power-the end of the Directory, the fall of Napoleon, the abdication of 
Louis XVIII-he was able to survive and even thrive, because he never 
elosed himself up in a small cirele but always forged connections with the 
neworder. 
This law pertains to kings and queens, and to those of the highest 
power: The moment you lose contact with your people, seeking security in 
isolation, rebellion is brewing. Never imagine yourself so elevated that you 
can afford to cut yourself off from even the lowest echelons. By retreating 
to a fortress, you make yourself an easy target for your plotting subjects, 
who view your isolation as an insult and a reason for rebellion. 
Since humans are such social creature s, it follows that the social arts 
that make us pleasant to be around can be practiced only by constant ex­
posure and circulation. The more you are in contact with others, the more 
graceful and at ease you become. Isolation, on the other hand, engenders 
an awkwa rdness in your gestures, and leads to further isolation, as people 
start avoiding you. 
In 1545 Duke Cosimo I de' Medici decided that to ensure the immor-
tality of his name he would commission frescoes for the main chapel of the 
church of San Lorenzo in Florence. He had many great painters to choose 
from, and in the end he picked J acopo da Pontormo. Getting on in years, 
Pontormo wanted to make these frescoes his chef d'oeuvre and legacy. His 
first decision was to elose the chapel off with walls, partitions, and blinds. 
He wanted no one to witness the creation of his masterpiece, or to steal his 
ideas. He would outdo Michelangelo hirns elf. When some young men 
broke into the chapel out of curiosity, J acopo sealed it off even further. 
Pontormo filled the chapel's ceiling with biblical scenes-the Creation, 
Adam and Eve, Noah's ark, on and on. At the top of the middle wall he 
painted Christ in his majesty, raising the dead on Judgment Day. The artist 
worked on the chapel for eleven years, rarely leaving it, since he had de­
veloped a phobia for human contact and was afraid his ideas would be 
stolen. 
Pontormo died before completing the frescoes, and none of them has 
survived. But the great Renaissance writer Vasari, a friend of Pontormo's 
who saw the frescoes shortly after the artist's death, left adescription of 
what they looked like. There was a total lack of proportion. Scenes 
bumped against scenes, figures in one story being juxtaposed with those in 
another, in maddening numbers. Pontormo had become obsessed with de­
tail but had lost any sense of the overall composition. Vasari left off his de­
scription of the frescoes by writing that if he continued, "I think I would go 
mad and become entangled in this painting, just as I believe that in the 
eleven years of time Jacopo spent on it, he entangled hirnself and anyone 
else who saw it." 1nstead of crowning Pontormo's career, the work became 
his undoing. 
These frescoes were visual equivalents of the effects of isolation on the 
human mind: a loss of proportion, an obsession with detail combined with 
an inability to see the larger picture, a kind of extravagant ugliness that no 
longer communicates. Clearly, isolation is as deadly for the creative arts as 
for the social arts. Shakespeare is the most famous writer in history be­
cause, as a dramatist for the popular stage, he opened hirns elf up to the 
masses, making his work accessible to people no matter what their educa­
tion and taste. Artists who hole themselves up in their fortress lose a sense 
of proportion, their work communicating only to their small circle. Such 
art remains comered and powerless. 
Finally, since power is a human creation, it is inevitably increased by 
contact with other people. 1nstead of falling into the fortress mentality, 
view the world in the following manner: 1t is like a vast Versailles, with 
every room communicating with another. You need to be permeable, able 
to float in and out of different circles and mix with different types. That 
kind of mobility and social contact will protect you from plotters, who will 
be unable to keep secrets from you, and from YOUf enemies, who will be 
unable to isolate you from yoUf allies. Always on the move, you mix and 
mingle in the rooms of the palace, never sitting or settling in one place. No 
hunter can fix his aim on such a swift-moving creatu re.

Authority: A good and wise prince, desirous of maintaining that

come oppressive, will never build fortresses, so that they may 
place their reliance upon the good will of their subjects, and not 
upon the strength of citadels. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527) 
REVERSAL 
It is hardly ever right and propitious to choose isolation. Without keeping 
an ear on what is happening in the streets, you will be unable to protect 
YOUfself. About the only thing that constant human contact cannot facili­
tate is thought. The weight of society's pressure to conform, and the lack of 
distance from other people, can make it impossible to think clearly ahout 
what is going on around you. As a temporary reCOUfse, then, isolation can 
help you to gain perspective. Many a serious thinker has heen produced in 
prisons, where we have nothing to do but think. Machiavelli could write 
The Prince only once he found hirnself in exile and isolated on a farm far 
from the political intrigues of Florence. 
The danger is, however, that this kind of isolation will sire all kinds of 
strange and perverted ideas. You may gain perspective on the larger pic­
ture, hut you lose a sense of your own smallness and limitations. Also, the 
more isolated you are, the harder it is to break out of YOUf isolation when 
you choose to-it sinks you deep into its quicksand without your noticing. 
If you need time to think, then, choose isolation only as a last resort, and 
only in small doses. Be careful to keep YOUf way hack into society open.

138 LAW 19 OPPON ENTS, SUC KERS, AND VICT IMS: Preliminary Typology 
In your rise to power you will come across many breeds of opponent, 
sucker, and victim. The hig hest form of the art of power is the ability to dis­
tinguish the wolves from the lambs, the foxes from the hares, the hawks 
from the vultures. If you make this distinction weIl, you will succeed with­
out needing to coerce anyone too much . But if you deal blindly with 
whomever crosses your path, you will have a life of constant sorrow, if you 
even live that long. Being able to recognize types of people, and to act ac­
cordingly, is critical. The following are the five most dangerous and diffi­
cult types of mark in the jungle, as identified by artists-con and 
otherwise-of the past. 
The Arrogant and Pro ud Man. Although he may initially disguise 
it, this man's touchy pride makes hirn very dangerous. Any perceived 
slight will lead to a vengeance of overwhelming violence . You may say to 
yourse lf, "But I only said such-and-such at a party, where everyone was 
drunk. ... " It does not matter. There is no sanity behind his overreaction, 
so do not waste time trying to figure hirn out. If at any point in your deal­
ings with a person you sense an oversensitive and overactive pride, flee. 
Whatever you are hoping for from hirn isn't worth it. 
The Hopelessly Insecure Man. This man is related to the proud and ar­
rogant type, but is less violent and harder to spot. His ego is fragile, his 
sense of self insecure, and if he feels hirnself deceived or attacked, the hurt 
will simmer. He will attack you in bites that will take forever to get big 
enough for you to notice. If you find you have deceived or harmed such a 
man, disappear for a long time. Do not stay around hirn or he will nibble 
you to death. 
Mr. Suspicion. Another variant on the breeds above, this is a future Joe 
Stalin. He sees what he wants to see-usually the worst -in other people, 
and imag ines that everyone is after hirn. Mr. Suspicion is in fact the least 
dangerous of the three: Genuinely unbala nced, he is easy to deceive, just as 
Stalin hirnself was constantly deceived. Play on his suspicious nature to get 
hirn to turn aga inst other people. But if you do become the target of his sus­
picions, watch out. 
The Serpent with a Long Memo ry. If hurt or deceived, this man will 
show no anger on the surfac e; he will calculate and wait. Then, when he is 
in a position to turn the tables, he will exact a revenge marked by a cold­
blooded shre wdness. Recognize this man by his calculation and cunning in 
the different areas of his life. He is usually cold and unaff ectionate . Be dou­
bly careful of this snake, and if you have somehow injured hirn, either 
crush him completely or get hirn out of your sight. 
The Plain, Unassuming, and Often Unintelligent Man. Ah, your ears 
prick up when you find such a tempting victim. But this man is a lot harder 
to deceive than you imagin e. Falling for a ruse often takes intelligence 
and imagination-a sense of the possible reward s. The blunt man will 
not take the bait because he does not recognize it. He is that unaware. The 
danger with this man is not that he will harm you or seek revenge, but 
rnerely that he will waste your time, energy, resources, and even your san­
ity in trying to deceive him. Have a test ready for a mark-a joke, a story. If 
his re action is utterly literal, this is the type you are dealing with. Continue 
at your own risk. 
TRANSGRESSIONS OF THE LAW 
Transgression I 
In the early part of the thirteenth century, Muhammad, the shah of 
Khwarezm, managed after many wars to forge a huge empire, extending 
west to present-day Turkey and south to Mgh anistan. The empi re's center 
was the great Asian capital of Samarka nd. The shah had a powernd, well­
trained army, and could mobilize 200,000 warriors within days. 
In 1219 Muhammad received an embassy from a new tribal leader to 
the east, Genghis Khan. The embassy included all sorts of gifts to the great 
Muhammad, representing the finest goods from Khan's small but growing 
Mongoi empire. Genghis Khan wanted to reopen the Silk Route to Europe, 
and offered to share it with Muhamm ad, while promising peace between 
the two empire s. 
Muhammad did not know this upstart from the east, who, it seemed to 
hirn, was extremely arrogant to try to talk as an equal to one so clearly his 
superior. He ignored Kha n's offer. Khan tried again: This time he sent a 
caravan of a hundred camels filled with the rarest artic les he had plun­
dered from China. Before the caravan reached Muhammad, however, 
Inalchik, the govemor of a region bordering on Samarkand, seized it 
for hirnself , and executed its leaders. 
Genghis Khan was sure that this was a mistake --that Inalchik had 
acted without Muha mmad' s approval. He sent yet another mission to 
Muhamm ad, reiterating his offer and asking that the govemor be puni shed. 
This time Muhammad hirnself had one of the ambassadors beheaded, and 
sent the other two back with shaved heads-a horrifying insult in the Mon­
goI code of honor. Khan sent a message to the shah: "You have chosen war. 
What will happen will happen, and what it is to be we know not; only God 
knows ." Mobilizing his forces, in 1220 he attacked Inalchik's provin ce, 
where he seized the capital, captured the govemor, and ordered hirn exe­
cuted by having molten silver poured into his eyes and ears. 
Over the next year, Khan led aseries of guerrilla-like campaigns 
against the shah's much larger army. His method was totally novel for the 
tirne-his soldiers could move very fast on horseback, and had mastered 
the art of firing with bow and arrow while mount ed. The speed and flexi­
bility of his forces allowed hirn to deceive Muhammad as to his intentions 
and the directions of his movements. Eventually he managed first to sur-prison, and put Aguirre 
on the beast .... The 
beast was driven on, 
and he received the 
lashes .... " 
When freed, Aguirre 
announced his inten­
tion of killing the offi­
eiai who had sentenced 
him, the aicalde 
Esquivel. Esquivel:, 
term of office expired 
and he fled to Lima, 
three hundred twenty 
leagues away, but 
within fifteen days 
Aguirre had tracked 
him there. The fright­
enedjudgejourneyed 
to Quito, a trip of four 
hundred leagues, and in 
twenty days Aguirre 
arrived. 
"When Esquivel heard 
of his presence, " 
according to Garcilaso, 
"he made another jour­
ney offive hundred 
leagues to Cuzco; but 
in a few days Aguirre 
also arrived, having 
travelled on foot and 
without shoes, saying 
that a whipped man 
has no business to ride 
a horse, or to go where 
he would be seen by 
others. In this way, 
Aguirre followed his 
judge for three years, 
and four months." 
Wearying of the 
pursuit, Esquivei 
remained at Cuzco, a 
city so stemly govemed 
that he feit he would be 
safe from Aguirre. He 
took a house near the 
cathedral and never 
ventured outdoors 
without a sword and a 
dagger. "However, on a

noon, Aguirre entered 
his house, and having 
walked all over it, and 
having traversed a

found that he had

Interpretation 
Never assurne that the person you are dealing with is weaker or less impor­
tant than you are. Some men are slow to take offense, which may make 
you misjudge the thickness of their skin, and fail to worry about insulting 
them. But should you offend their honor and their pride, they will over­
whelm you with a violence that seems sudden and extreme given their 
slowness to anger. If you want to turn people down, it is best to do so po­
litely and respectfully, even if you feel their request is impudent or their 
offer ridiculous. Never reject them with an insult until you know them bet­
ter; you may be dealing with a Genghis Khan. 
Transgression II 
In the late 1910s some of the best swindlers in America fo rmed a con-artist 
ring based in Denver, Colorado . In the winter months they would spread 
across the southern states, plying their trade. In 1920 Joe Furey, aleader of 
the ring, was working his way through Texas, making hundreds of thou­
sands of dollars with classic con games. In Fort Worth, he met a sucker 
named J. Frank Norfleet, a cattleman who owned a large ranch. Norfleet 
fell for the con. Convinced of the riches to come, he emptied his bank ac­
count of $45,000 and handed it over to Furey and his confederate s. A few 
days later they gave him his "millions ," which tumed out to be a few good 
dollars wrapped around a packet of newspaper clippings . 
Furey and his men had worked such cons a hundred times before, and 
the sucker was usually so embarrassed by his gullibility that he quietly 
leamed his lesson and accepted the loss. But Norfleet was not like other 
suckers. He went to the police, who told hirn there was little they could do. 
"Then 1'11 go after those people myself," Norfleet told the detectives. "1'11 
get them, too, if it takes the rest of my life." His wife took over the ranch as 
Norfleet scoured the country, looking for others who had been fleeced in 
the same game. One such sucker came forward, and the two men identified 
one of the con artists in San Francisco, and managed to get hirn locked up. 
The man committed suicide rather than face a long term in prison. 
Norfleet kept going. He tracked down another of the con artists in 
Montana, roped him like a calf, and dragged hirn through the muddy streets 
to the town jail. He traveled not only across the country but to England, 
Canada, and Mexico in search of Joe Furey, and also of Furey's right-hand 
man, W B. Spencer. Finding Spencer in Montreal, Norfleet chased him 
through the streets. Spencer escaped but the rancher stayed on his trail and 
caught up with him in Salt Lake City. Preferring the mercy of the law to 
Norfleet's wrath, Spencer turned hirnself in. 
Norfleet found Furey in Jacksonville, Florida, and personally hauled 
him off to face justice in Texas. But he wouldn't stop there: He continued 
on to Denver, determined to break up the entire ring. Spending not only 
large sums of money but another year of his life in the pursuit, he managed 
to put all of the con ring's leaders behind bars. Even some he didn't catch 
had grown so terrified of hirn that they too turned themselves in. 
After five years of hunting, Norfleet had single-handedly destroyed the 
eountry's largest confederation of con artists. The effort bankrupted hirn 
and ruined his marriage, but he died a satisfied man. 
Interpretation 
Most men accept the humiliation of being conned with a sense of resigna­
tion. They leam their lesson, recognizing that there is no such thing as a 
free lunch, and that they have usually been brought down by their own 
greed for easy money. Some, however, refuse to take their medicine. In­
stead of reflecting on their own gullibility and avarice, they see themselves 
as totally innocent victims. 
Men like this may seem to be crusaders for justice and honesty, but 
they are actually immoderately insecure. Being fooled, being conned, has 
activated their self-doubt, and they are desperate to repair the damage. 
Were the mortgage on Norfleet's ranch, the collapse of his marriage, and 
the years of borrowing money and living in cheap hotels worth his revenge 
over his embarras sment at being fleeced? To the Norfleets of the world , 
overcoming their embarrassment is worth any price. 
All people have insecurities, and often the best way to deceive a sucker 
is to play upon his insecurities. But in the realm of power, everything is a 
question of degree, and the person who is decidedly more insecure than 
the average mortal presents great dangers. Be wamed: If you practice de­
eeption or trickery of any sort, study your mark weIl. Some people's inse­
eurity and ego fragility cannot tolerate the slightest offense. To see if you 
are dealing with such a type, test them first-make, say, a mild joke at their 
expense. A confident person williaugh; an overly insecure one will react as 
if personally insulted. If you suspect you are dealing with this type, find an­
other victim. 
Transgression III 
In the fifth century B.C., Ch'ung-erh, the prince of Ch'in (in present-day 
China), had been forced into exile. He lived modestly- even, sometimes, 
in poverty-wai ting for the time when he could return horne and resurne 
his princely life. Once he was passing through the state of Cheng, where 
the mler, not knowing who he was, treated hirn rudely. The ruler's minis­
ter, Shu Chan, saw this and said, "This man is a worthy prince. May Your 
Highness treat hirn with great courtesy and thereby place hirn under an 
obligation!" But the ruler, able to see only the prince's lowly station, ig­
nored this advice and insulted the prince again. Shu Chan again warned 
his master, saying, "If Your Highness cannot treat Ch'ung-erh with cour­
tesy, you should put hirn to death, to avoid calamity in the future." The 
mler only scoffed. 
Years later, the prince was finally able to return horne, his circum­
stances greatly changed. He did not forget who had been kind to hirn, and 
LAW 19 141 
142 LAW 19 who had been insolent, during his years of poverty. Least of a1l did he for­
get his treatment at the hands of the ruler of Cheng. At his first opportunity 
he assembled a vast army and marched on Cheng, taking eight eities, de­
stroying the kingdom, and sending the ruler into an exile of his own. 
Interpretation 
You can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of litde im­
portance and me ans today can be a person of power tomorrow. We forget 
a lot in our lives, but we rarely forget an insult 
How was the ruler of Cheng to know that Prince Ch'ung-erh was an 
ambitious, calculating, cunning type, a serpent with a long memory ? There 
was really no way for him to know, you may say-but since there was no 
way, it would have been better not to tempt the fates by finding out. There 
is nothing to be gained by insulting a person unneces sarily. Swa1low the 
impulse to offend, even if the other person seems weak. The satisfaction is 
meager compared to the danger that someday he or she will be in a posi­
tion to hurt you. 
Transgression IV 
The year of 1920 had been a particularly bad one for American art dealers. 
Big buyers-the robber-baron generation of the previous century- were 
getting to an age where they were dying off like flies, and no new rnillion­
aires had emerged to take their place. Things were so bad that a number of 
the major dealers decided to pool their resources, an unheard- of event, 
since art dealers usually get along like cats and dogs. 
Joseph Duveen, art dealer to the richest tycoons of America, was suf­
fering more than the others that year, so he deeided to go along with this 
alliance. The group now consisted of the five biggest dealers in the country. 
Looking around for a new client, they deeided that their last best hope was 
Henry Ford, then the wealthiest man in America. Ford had yet to venture 
into the art market, and he was such a big target that it made sense for them 
to work together . 
The dealers deeided to assemble a list, "The 100 Greatest Paintings in 
the World" (a1l of which they happened to have in stock) , and to offer the 
lot of them to Ford. With one purchase he could make himself the world's 
greatest collector. The consortium worked for weeks to produce a magnifi­
cent object: a three-volume set of books containing beautiful reproductions 
of the paintings, as well as scholarly texts accompanying each picture. Next 
they made a personal visit to Ford at his home in Dearbom, Michigan. 
There they were surprised by the simplicity of his house: Mr. Ford was ob­
viously an extremely unaffected man. 
Ford received them in his study. Looking through the book, he ex­
pressed astonishment and delight. The exeited dealers began imagining the 
millions of dollars that would short1y flow into their coffers. Fina1ly, how­
ever, Ford looked up from the book and said, "Gendemen, beautiful books 
like these, with beautiful colored pictures like these, must cost an awful 
lot!" "But Mr. Ford!" exclaimed Duveen, "we don't expect you to buy these 
books. We got them up especially for you, to show you the pietures. These 
books are a present to you." Ford seemed puzzled. "Gentlemen," he said, 
"it is extremely nice of you, but I really don't see how I can accept a beau­
tiful, expensive present like this from strangers." Duveen explained to Ford 
that the reproductions in the books showed paintings they had hoped to 
seIl to hirn. Ford finally underst ood. "But gent lemen," he exclaimed, "what 
would I want with the original pietures when the ones right here in these 
books are so beautiful?" 
Interpretation 
Joseph Duveen prided hirnself on studying his victims and clients in ad­
vance, figuring out their weaknesses and the peculiarities of their tastes be­
fore he ever met them. He was driven by desperation to drop this tactic just 
once, in his assault on Henry Ford. It took hirn months to recover from his 
misjudgment, both mentally and mone tarily. Ford was the unassuming 
plain-man type who just isn't worth the bother. He was the incarnation of 
those literal-minded folk who do not possess enough imagina tion to be de­
eeived. From then on, Duveen saved his energies for the Mellons and Mor­
gans of the world-men crafty enough for hirn to entrap in his snares. 
KEYS TO POWER 
The ability to meaSUfe people and to know who you're dealing with is the 
most important skill of all in gathering and conserving power. Without it 
you are blind: Not only will you off end the wrong people, you will choose 
the wrong types to work on, and will think you are flattering people when 
you are actually insulting them. Before embarking on any move, take the 
measure of YOUf mark or potential opponent. Otherwise you will waste 
time and make mistake s. Study people's weaknesses, the chinks in their 
annor, their areas ofboth pride and insecurity. Know their ins and outs be­
fore you even decide whether or not to deal with them. 
Two final words of caution : First, in judging and measuring your oppo­
nent, never rely on your instinct s. You will make the greatest mistakes of all 
if you rely on such inexact indicat ors. Nothing can substitute for gathering 
eonerete knowledge. Study and spy on YOUf opponent for however long it 
takes; this will pay off in the long run. 
Second, never trust appearances. Anyone with a serpent's heart can 
use a show of kindness to cloak it; a person who is blustery on the outside is 
often really a coward. Leam to see through appearances and their contra­
c1ietions. Never trust the version that people give of themselves -it is ut­
terly unrelia ble.

OBSER VA NC E OF THE LAW 
When Queen Elizabeth I ascended the throne of England, in 1558, there 
was much to-do about her finding a husband. The issue was debated in Par­
liament, and was a main topic of conversation among Englishmen of all 
classes; they often disag reed as to whom she should marry, but everyone 
thought she should marry as soon as possible, for a queen must have a 
king, and must bear heirs for the kingdom. The debates raged on for years. 
Meanwhile the most handsome and eligi ble bachelors in the re alm-Sir 
Robert Dudley, the Earl of Essex, Sir Wal ter Raleigh- vied for Eliza beth's 
hand. She did not discourage them, but she seemed to be in no hurry, and 
her hints as to which man might be her favorite often contradicted each 
other. In 1566, Parliament sent adelegation to Eliza beth urging her to 
marry before she was too old to bear children. She did not argue, nor did 
she discourage the delegation, but she remain ed a virgin nonetheless. 
The delicate game that Eliza beth played with her suitors slowly made 
her the subj ect of innumerable sexual fanta sies and the ob ject of cultish 
worship. The court physician, Simon Forman, used his diary to describe 
his dreams of deflowering her. Painters represented her as Diana and other 
goddesses. The poet Edmund Spenser a'"'d others wrote eulogies to the Vir­
gin Queen. She was referred to as "thc world' s Emp resse," "that virtuous 
Virgo" who rules the world and sets the stars in motion. In conversa tion 
with her, her many male suitors would employ bold sexual innuendo, a 
dare that Elizabeth did not discourage . She did an she could to stir their in­
terest and simultaneously keep them at bay. 
Throughout Europe, kings and princes knew that a marriage with Eliz­
abeth would seal an alliance between England and any nation. The king of 
Spain wooed her, as did the prince of Sweden and the archduke of Austria. 
She politely refu sed them alt 
The great diplomatie issue of Eliza beth's day was posed by the revolt 
of the Flemish and Dutch Lowlands, which were then possess ions of Spain. 
Should England break its alliance with Spain and choose France as its main 
ally on the Continent, thereby encouraging Flemish and Dutch indepen­
dence? By 1570 it had come to seem that an alliance with France would be 
Engla nd's wisest course. France had two eligible men of noble blood, the 
dukes of Anjou and Alenc;on, brothers of the French king. Wo uld either of 
them marry Eliza beth? Both had advantages, and Elizabeth kept the hopes 
of both alive. The issue simm ered for years. The duke of Anjou made sev-
eral visits to England, kissed Elizabeth in public, even called her by pet 
names; she appeared to requite his affections. Meanw hile, as she flirted 
with the two brothers, a treaty was signed that sealed peace between 
France and England. By 1582 Elizabeth feit she could break off the 
courtsh ip. In the case of the duke of Anjou in particular, she did so with 
great relief: For the sake of diplomacy she had aHowed herself to be 
courted by a man whose presence she could not stand and whom she 
found physically repulsive. Once peace between France and England was 
secure, she dropped the unctuous duke as politely as she could. 
By this time Elizabeth was too old to bear children. She was accord­
ingly able to live the rest of her life as she desired, and she died the Vrrgin 
Queen. She left no direct heir, but mIed through aperiod of incomparable 
peace and cultural fertility. 
Interpretation 
Elizabeth had good reason not to marry: She had witnessed the mistakes of 
Mary Queen of Scots, her cousin. Resisting the idea of being mIed by a 
woman, the Scots expected Mary to marry and marry wisely. To wed a for­
eigner would be unpopular; to favor any particular noble house would 
open up terrible rivalrie s. In the end Mary chose Lord Damley, a Catholic. 
In doing so she incurred the wrath of Scotland's Protestants, and endless 
turmoil ensued. 
Elizabeth knew that marriage can often lead to a female mler's undo­
ing: By marrying and committing to an alliance with one party or nation, 
the queen becomes embroiled in conflicts that are not of her choosing, con­
fliets which may eventually overwhelm her or lead her into a futile war. 
Also, the husband becomes the de facto mler, and often tries to do away 
with his wife the queen, as Damley tried to get rid of Mary. Elizabeth 
learned the lesson weH. She had two goals as amier: to a--oid marriage and 
to avoid war. She managed to combine these goals by t....:ngling the possi­
bility of marriage in order to forge alliances. The moment she committed 
to any single suitor would have been the moment she lost her power. She 
had to emanate mystery and desirability, never discouraging anyone's 
hopes but never yielding. 
Through this lifelong game of flirting and withdrawing, Elizabeth 
dominated the country and every man who sought to conquer her. As the 
center of attention, she was in contro!. Keeping her independence above 
all, Elizabeth protected her power and made herself an object of worship . 
I would rather be a beggar and single than a queen and married. 
Queen Elizabeth I, 1533-1 603 
KEYS TO POWER 
Since power depends greatly on appeara nces, you must leam the tricks 
that will enhance your image. Refusing to commit to a person or group is 
one of these. When you hold yourself back, you incur not anger but a kind 
LAW 20 147 
148 LAW 20 of respect. You instantly seem powerful because you make yourself un­
grasp able, rather than succumbing to the group, or to the relationship, as 
most people do. This aura of power only grows with time: As your reputa­
tion for independence grows, more and more people will come to desire 
you, wanting to be the one who gets you to commit. Desire is like a virus: If 
we see that someone is desired by other people, we tend to find this person 
desirable too. 
The moment you commit, the magic is gone. You become like every­
one else. People will try all kinds of underhanded methods to get you to 
commit. They will give you gifts, shower you with favors, all to put you 
under obligation. Encourage the attention, stimulate their interest, but do 
not commit at any cost. Accept the gifts and favors if you so desire, but be 
careful to maintain your inner aloofne ss. You cannot inadvertently allow 
yourself to feel obligated to anyone. 
Remember, though : The goal is not to put people off, or to make it seem 
that you are incapable of commitment. Uke the Virgin Queen, you need to 
stir the pot, excite interest, lure people with the possibility of having you. 
You have to bend to their attention occasionally, then-but never too far. 
The Greek soldier and statesman Alcibiades played this game to per­
fection. It was Alcibiades who inspired and led the massive Athenian ar­
mada that invaded Sicily in 414 B.C. When envious Athenians back horne 
tried to bring hirn down by accusing hirn of trumped-up charge s, he de­
fected to the enemy, the Spartan s, instead of facing a trial back horne. Then, 
after the Athenians were defeated at Syracu se, he left Sparta for Persia, even 
though the power of Sparta was now on the rise. Now, however, both the 
Athenians and the Spartans courted Alcibiades because of his influ ence 
with the Persia ns; and the Per lans showered hirn with honors because of 
his power over the Athenians and the Sparta ns. He made promises to every 
side but committed to none, and in the end he held all the cards. 
If you aspire to power and influ ence, try the Alcibiades tactic: Put 
yourself in the middle between competing powers. Lure one side with the 
promise of your help; the other side, always wanting to outdo its enemy, 
will pursue you as weIl. As each side vies for your attention, you will im­
mediately seem a person of great influ ence and desira bility. More power 
will accrue to you than if you had rashly committed to one side. To perfect 
this tactic you need to keep yourself inwardly free from emotional entan­
glements, and to view all those around you as pawns in your rise to the top. 
You cannot let yourself become the lackey for any caus e. 
In the midst of the 1968 U.S. presidential election, Henry Kissinger 
made a phone call to Richard Nixon's team. Kissinger had been allied with 
Nelson RockefeIler, who had unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomina­
tion. Now Kissinger offered to supply the Nixon camp with valuable inside 
information on the negotiations for peace in Vietnam that were then going 
on in Paris. He had a man on the negotiating team keeping rum informed of 
the latest developments. The Nixon team gladly accepted his offer. 
At the same time, however, Kissinger also approached the Democratic 
nominee, Hubert Humphrey, and offered his aid. The Humphrey people 
asked hirn for inside information on Nixon and he supplied it. "Look," 
Kissinger told Humphrey's people, "I've hated Nixon for years." In fact he 
had no interest in either side. What he really wanted was what he got: the 
promise of a high-level cabinet post from both Nixon and Humphrey. 
Whichever man won the election, Kissinger's career was secure. 
The winner, of course, was Nixon, and Kissinger duly went on to his 
cabinet post. Even so, he was careful never to appear too much of a Nixon 
man. When Nixon was reelected in 1972, men much more loyal to hirn 
than Kissinger were fired. Kissinger was also the only Nixon high official to 
survive Watergate and serve under the next president, Gerald Ford. By 
maintaining a little distance he thrived in turbulent times. 
Those who use this strategy often notice a strange phenomenon: 
People who rush to the support of others tend to gain little respect in the 
process, for their help is so easily obtained, while those who stand back 
find themselves besieged with supplicants. Their aloofness is powerful, and 
everyone wants them on their side. 
When Picasso, after early years of poverty, had become the most suc­
cessful artist in the world, he did not commit hirnself to this dealer or that 
dealer, although they now besieged hirn from all sides with attractive offers 
and grand promises. Instead, he appeared to have no interest in their ser­
vices; this technique drove them wild, and as they fought over hirn his 
prices only rose. When Henry Kissinger, as U.S. secretary of state, wanted 
to re ach dHente with the Soviet Union, he made no concessions or concil­
iatory gestures, but courted China instead. This infuriated and also scared 
the Soviets-they were already politica 11y isolated and feared further isola­
tion if the United States and China_came together. Kissinger's move 
pushed them to the negotiating table. The tactic has a parallel in seduction: 
When you want to seduce a woman, Stendhal advises, court her sister first. 
Stay aloof and people will come to you. It will become achalienge for 
them to win your affections. As long as you imitate the wise Virgin Queen 
and stimulate their hopes, you will remain a magnet of attention and desire.

150 LAW 20 PART II: DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE-
STAY ABOVE THE FRAY 
Do not let people drag you into their petty fights and squabbles. Seem inter­
ested and supportive, but find a way to remain neutral; let others do the 
fighting while you stand back, watch and wait. lWten the fighting parties 
are good and tired they will be ripe for the picking. You can make it a prac­
tice, in fact, to stir up quarrels between other people, and then offer to medi­
ate, gaining power as the go-between . 
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 
In the late fifteenth century, the strongest city-states in Italy-V enice, Flo­
rence, Rome, and Milan-found themselves constantly squabbling. Hover­
ing above their strugg les were the nations of Fran ce and Spain, ready to 
grab whatever they could from the weakened Italian powers. And trapped 
in the middle was the small state of Mantua, role d by the young Duke 
Gianfra ncesco Gonzaga. Mantua was strategically located in northern 
Italy, and it seemed only a matter of time before one of the powers swal­
lowed it up and it ceased to exist as an independent king dom. 
Gonzaga was a fierce warrior and a skilled commander of tro ops, and 
he became a kind of mercenary general for whatever side paid hirn best. In 
the year 1490, he married Isabella d'Este, daughter of the roler of another 
small Italian duchy, Ferrara. Since he now spent most of his time away 
fron Mantua, it fell to Isabella to rule in his stead. 
Isabella' s first true test as roler came in 1498, when King Louis XII of 
France was preparing armies to attack Milan. In their usual perfidious fash­
ion, the Italian states immediately looked for ways to profit from Mila n's 
difficult ies. Pope Alexander VI promised not to intervene, thereby giving 
the French carte blanche . The Venetians signaled that they would not help 
Milan, either-and in exchange for this, they hoped the French would give 
them Mantua. The roler of Milan, Lodovico Sforza, suddenly found him­
self alone and aband oned. He turned to Isabella d'Este, one of his dosest 
friends (also ro mored to be his lover ), and begged her to persuade Duke 
Gonzaga to come to his aid. Isabella tried, but her husband balked, for he 
saw Sforza's cause as hopeless. And so, in 1499, Louis swooped down on 
Milan and took it with ease. 
Isabella now faced a dilemma: If she stayed loyal to Lodovico, the 
French would now move against her. But if, instead, she allied herself with 
France, she would make enemies elsewhere in Italy, compromising Man­
tua once Louis eventually withdrew. And if she looked to Venice or Rome 
for help, they would simply swallow up Mantua under the doak of coming 
to her aid. Yet she had to do something. The mighty king of France was 
brea thing down her neck: She decided to befriend him, as she had be­
friended Lodovico Sforza before him-with alluring gifts, witty, intelligent 
letters, and the pos sibility of her company, for Isabella was fam ous as a 
woman of incomparable bea uty and charm. 
In 1500 Louis invited Isabella to a great party in Milan to celebrate his 
victory. Leonardo da Vinci built an enormous mechanical lion for the af­
fair: When the lion opened its mouth, it spewed fresh lilies, the symbols of 
French royalty. At the party Isabella wore one of her celebrated dresses 
(she had by far the largest wardrobe of any of the Italian princesses), and 
just as she had hoped, she charmed and captivated Louis, who ignored all 
the other ladies vying for his attention. She so on became his constant com­
panion, and in exchange for her friendship he pledged to protect Mantua's 
independence from Venice. 
As one danger receded, however, another, more worrying one arose, 
this time from the south, in the form of Cesare Borgia. Starting in 1500, 
Borgia had marched steadily northward, gobbling up all the small king­
doms in his path in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. Isabella under­
stood Cesare perfectly: He could be neither trusted nor in any way 
offended. He had to be cajoled and kept at arm's length. Isabella began by 
sending hirn gifts-falcons, prize dogs, perfumes, and dozens of masks, 
which she knew he always wore when he walked the streets of Rome. She 
sent messengers with flattering greetings (although these messengers also 
acted as her spies). At one point Cesare asked if he could house some 
troops in Mantua; Isabella managed to dissuade hirn politely, knowing full 
weIl that once the troops were quartered in the city, they would never 
leave. 
Even while Isabella was charming Cesare, she convinced everyone 
around her to take care never to utter a harsh word about hirn, since he 
had spies everywhere and would use the slightest pretext for invasion. 
When Isabella had a child, she asked Cesare to be the godfather. She even 
dangled in front of hirn the possibility of a marriage between her family 
and his. Somehow it all worked, for although elsewhere he seized every­
thing in his path, he spared Mantua. 
In 1503 Cesare's father, Alexander, died, and a few years later the new 
pope, Julius 11, went to war to drive the French troops from Italy. When 
the mler of Ferrara-Alf onso, Isabella's brother-si ded with the French, 
Julius decided to attack and humble hirn. Once again Isabella found herself 
in the middle: the pope on one side, the French and her brother on the 
other. She dared not ally herself with either, but to off end either would be 
equally disastrous. Again she played the double game at which she had be­
come so expert. On the one hand she got her husband Gonzaga to fight for 
the pope, knowing he would not fight very hard. On the other she let 
French troops pass through Mantua to come to Ferrara's aid. While she 
publidy complained that the French had "invaded" her territory, she pri­
vately supplied them with valuable information. To make the invasion 
plausible to Julius, she even had the French pretend to plunder Mantua. It 
worked once again: The pope left Mantua alone. 
In 1513, after a lengthy siege, Julius defeated Ferrara, and the French 
troops withdrew. Worn out by the effort, the pope died a few months later. 
With his death, the nightrnarish cyde of battles and petty squabbles began 
to repeat itself. leisurely feeding on the 
dead kites and crows. 
and then left the place 
haie and hearty, 
observing, "The weak

An eagle built a nest on

The eagle used to fly

LEO TOLSTOY, 
1828-1910 
152 LAW 20 A great deal changed in ltaly during Isabella's reign: Popes came and 
went, Cesare Borgia rose and then fell, Venice lost its empire, Milan was in­
vaded, Florence fell into decline, and Rome was sacked by the Hapsburg 
Emperor Charles V. Through all this, tiny Mantua not only survived but 
thrived, its court the envy of Italy. Its wealth and soverei gnty would remain 
intact for a century after Isabella's death, in 1539. 
Interpretation 
Isabella d'Este understood Italy 's political situation with amazing clarity: 
Once you took the side of any of the forces in the field, you were doomed. 
The powerful would take you over, the weak would wear you down. Any 
new alliance would lead to a new enemy, and as this cycle stirred up more 
conflict, other forces would be dragge d in, until you could no longer extri­
cate yourself. Eventually you would collapse from exhausti on. 
Isabella steered her kingdom on the only course that would bring her 
safely through . She would not allow herself to lose her head through loy­
alty to a duke or a king. Nor would she try to stop the conflict that raged 
around her-that would only drag her into it. And in any case the conflict 
was to her advantage . If the various parties were fighting to the death, and 
exhausting themselves in the process, they were in no position to gobble 
up Mantua. The source of Isabella's power was her clever ability to seem 
interested in the affai rs and interests of each side, while actually commit­
ting to no one but herself and her kingd om. 
Once you step into a fight that is not of your own choosing, you lose all 
initiativ e. The comba tants' interests become your interests; you become 
their tool. Leam to control yourself , to restrain your natural tendency to 
take sides and join the fight. Be friendly and charming to each of the com­
batants, then step back as they collide. With every battle they grow weaker, 
while you grow stronger with every battle you avoid. 
When the sni pe and the mussel struggle, the fisherman gets the benefit. 
Ancient Chinese saying 
KEYS TO POWER 
To succeed in the game of power, you have to master your emotions. But 
even if you succeed in gaining such self-control, you can never control the 
temperamental dispositions of those around you. And this presents a great 
danger. Most people operate in a whirlp ool of emotions, constantly react­
ing, chuming up squabbles and conflicts. Your self-control and autonomy 
will only bother and infuriate them. They will try to draw you into the 
whir lpool, begging you to take sides in their endless battl es, or to make 
peace for them. If you succumb to their emotional entreaties, little by little 
you will find your mind and time occupied by tkeir problems. Do not allow 
whatever compassion and pity you possess to suck you in. You can never 
win in this game; the conflicts can only multiply. 
On the other hand, you cannot completely stand aside, for that would 
cause needless offense. To play the game properly, you must seem inter­
ested in other people's problems, even sometimes appear to take their side. 
But while you make outward gestures of support, you must maintain your 
inner energy and sanity by keeping your emotions disengaged. No matter 
how hard people try to puH you in, never let your interest in their affairs 
and petty squabbles go beyond the surface. Give them gifts, listen with a 
sympathetic look, even occasionally play the charmer-b ut inwardly keep 
both the friendly kings and the perfidious Borgias at arm's length. By refus­
ing to commit and thus maintaining your autonomy you retain the initia­
tive: Your moves stay matters of your own choosing, not defensive 
reactions to the push-and-puH of those around you. 
Slowness to pick up your weapons can be a weapon itself, especia lly if 
you let other people exhaust themselves fighting, then take advantage of 
their exhaustion. In ancient China, the kingdom of Chin once invaded the 
kingdom of Hsing. Huan, the ruler of a nearby province, thought he 
should rush to Hsing's defense, but his adviser counseled hirn to wait: 
"Hsing is not yet going to ruin," he said, "and Chin is not yet exhausted. If 
ehin is not exhausted, [we] cannot become very influenti al. Moreover, the 
merit of supporting astate in danger is not as great as the virtue of reviving 
a ruined one." The adviser's argument won the day, and as he had pre­
dicted, Huan later had the glory both of rescuing Hsing from the brink of 
destruction and then of conquering an exhausted Chin. He stayed out of 
the fighting until the forces engaged in it had worn each other down, at 
which point it was safe for hirn to intervene. 
That is what holding back from the fray allows you: time to position 
yourself to take advantage of the situation once one side starts to lose. You 
can also take the game a step further, by promising your support to both 
sides in a conflict while maneuvering so that the one to come out ahead in 
the struggle is you. This was what Castruccio Castracani, ruler of the Italian 
town of Lucca in the fourteenth century, did when he had designs on the 
town of Pistoia. A siege would have been expensive, costing both lives and 
money, but Castruccio knew that Pistoia contained two riyal factions, the 
Blacks and the Whites, which hated one another. He negotiated with the 
Blacks, promising to help them against the Whites; then, without their 
knowledge, he promised the Whites he would help them against the 
Blacks. And Castruccio kept his promises-he sent an army to a Black­
controlled gate to the city, which the sentries of course welcomed in. 
Meanwhile another of his armies entered through a White-controHed gate. 
The two armies united in the middle, occupied the town, kiHed the leaders 
ofboth factions, ended the internal war, and took Pistoia for Castruc cio. 
Preserving your autonomy gives you options when people come to 
blows-y ou can play the mediator, broker the peace, while really securing 
YOUT own interests. You can pledge support to one side and the other may 
have to court you with a higher bid. ür, like Castr uccio, you can appear to 
take both sides, then play the antagonists against each other. 
Oftentimes when a conflict breaks out, you are tempted to side with 
the stronger party, or the one that offers you apparent advantage s in an al-THE PRICE OF EI'\YY

In France's July Revolution of 1830, after three days of riots, the states­
man Talleyrand, now elderly, sat by his Paris window, listening to the peal­

"Ah, the bells! We're winnin g." "Who's 'we,' mon prince?" the assistant 
asked. Gesturing for the man to keep quiet, Talleyrand replied, "Not a 
word! 1'11 tell you who we are tomorrow. " He well knew that only fools 
rush into a situation -that by committing too quickly you lose your ma­
neuverability. People also respect you less: Perhaps tomorrow, they think, 
you will commit to another, different cause, since you gave YOUfself so eas­
ily to this one. Good fortune is a fickle god and will often pass from one 
side to the other. Commitment to one side deprives you of the advantage of 
time and the luxury of waiting. Let others fall in love with this group or 
that; for YOUf part don't rush in, don't lose YOUf head. 
Finally, there are occasions when it is wisest to drop all pretence of ap­
pearing supportive and instead to trumpet your independence and self­
reliance. The aristocratic pose of independence is particularly important 
for those who need to gain respect. George Washington recognized this in 
his work to establish the young American republic on firm ground. As 
president, Washington avoided the temptation of making an alliance with 
France or England, despite the pressUfe on hirn to do so. He wanted the 
country to eam the world's respect through its independe nce. Although a 
treaty with France mighthave helped in the short term, in the long run he 
knew it would be more effective to establish the nation's autonomy. Eu­
rope would have to see the United States as an equal power. 
Remember: You have only so much energy and so much time. Every 
moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from YOUf strength . You 
may be afraid that people will condemn you as heartless, but in the end, 
maintaining YOUf independence and self-reliance will gain you more re­
spect and place you in a position of power from which you can choose to 
help others on YOUf own initiative.

Both parts of this law will turn against you if you take it too far. The game

you may find it worthwhile to commit to one side--if only for appeara nces'

Even then, however, the key will he to maintain your inner indepen­

OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW 
In the winter of 1872, the U.S. financier Asbury Harpending was visiting 
London when he received a cable: A diamond mine had been discovered 
in the American West. The cable came from a reliable source-William 
Ralston, owner of the Bank of California-but Harpending nevertheless 
took it as a practical joke, probably inspired by the recent discovery of 
huge diamond mines in South Africa. True, when reports had first come in 
of gold being discovered in the western United States, everyone had been 
skeptical, and those had turned out to be true. But a diamond mine in the 
West! Harpending showed the cable to his fellow financier Baron Roth­
schild (one of the richest men in the world), saying it must be a joke. The 
baron, however, replied, "Don't be too sure ab out that. America is a very 
large country. It has furnished the world with many surpri ses already. Per­
haps it has others in store." Harpending promptly took the first ship back 
to the States. 
When Harpending reached San Francisco, there was an excitement in 
the air recalling the Gold Rush days of the late 1840s. Two crusty prospec­
tors named Philip Amold and John Slack had been the ones to find the di­
amond rnine. They had not divulged its location, in Wyoming, but had led 
a highly respected mining expert to it several weeks back, taking a circular 
route so he could not guess his whereabouts. Once there, the expert had 
watched as the miners dug up diamonds. Back in San Francisco the expert 
bad taken the gems to various jewelers, one of whom had estimated their 
worth at $1.5 million. 
Harpending and Ralston now asked Amold and Slack to accompany 
them back to New York, where the jeweler Charles Tiffany would verify 
the original estimates. The prospectors responded uneasily-they smelled 
a trap: How could they trust these city slickers? What if Tiffany and the fi­
nanciers managed to steal the whole mine out from under them? Ralston 
tried to allay their fears by giving them $100,000 and placing another 
$300,000 in escrow for them. If the deal went through, they would be paid 
an additional $300,000. The miners agreed. 
The little group traveled to New York, where a meeting was held at the 
mansion of Samuel L. Barlow. The cream of the city's aristocracy was in at­
tendance-Gen eral George Brinton McClellan, commander of the Union 
forces in the Civil War; General Benjamin Butler; Horace Greeley, editor 
of the newspaper the New York Tribune; Harpending; Ralston; and Tiffany. 
Only Slack and Amold were missing-as tourists in the city, they had de­
cided to go sight-seeing. 
When Tiffany announced that the gems were real and worth a fortune, 
the financiers could barely control their excitement. They wired Roth­
schild and other tycoons to tell them about the diamond mine and inviting 
them to share in the investment. At the same time, they also told the 
prospectors that they wanted one more test: They insisted that a mining ex­
pert of their choosing accompany Slack and Amold to the site to verify its 
wealth. The prospectors reluctantly agreed. In the meantime, they said, Now. there is nothing

158 LAW 21 they had to return to San Francisco. The jewels that Tiffany had examined 
they left with Harpending for safekeeping. 
Several weeks later, a man named Louis Janin, the best mining expert 
in the country, met the prospectors in San Fran cisco. Janin was a born 
skeptic who was determined to make sure that the mine was not a fraud. 
Accompanying Janin were Harpending, and several other inter ested fi­
nanciers. As with the previous expert, the prospectors led the team through 
a complex series of canyons, completely confusing them as to their where­
abouts . Arriving at the site, the fina nciers watched in amazement as Janin 
dug the area up, leveling anthills, turning over boulders, and finding emer­
alds, rub ies, sapphires, and most of all dia monds. The dig lasted eight days, 
and by the end, Janin was conv inced: He told the investors that they now 
possessed the richest field in mining history. "With a hundred men and 
proper mach inery," he told them, "1 would guarantee to send out one mil­
lion dollars in diamonds every thirty days." 
Returning to San Francisco a few days later, Ral ston, Harpending, and 
company acted fast to form a $10 million corporation of private investors. 
First, however, they had to get rid of Amold and Slack. That meant hiding 
their exciteme nt-they certainly did not want to reveal the field's real 
value. So they played possum. Who knows if Janin is right, they told the 
prospectors, the mine may not be as rich as we think. This just made the 
prospectors angry. Trying a different tactic, the financiers told the two men 
that if they insisted on having shares in the mine, they would end up being 
fleeced by the unscrupulous tycoons and investors who would run the cor­
poratio n; better, they said, to take the $700,000 already offered-an enor­
mous sum at the time-and put their greed aside. This the prospe ctors 
seemed to understand, and they finally agreed to take the money, in return 
signing the rights to the site over to the fina nciers, and leaving maps to it. 
News of the mine spread like wildfi re. Prospectors farm ed out across 
Wyoming. Meanwhile Harpending and group began spending the millions 
they had collected from their investors, buying equipment, hiring the best 
men in the busine ss, and fumishing luxurious offices in New York and San 
Fran cisco. 
A few weeks later, on their first trip back to the site, they learned the 
hard truth : Not a single diamond or ruby was to be found. It was all a fake. 
They were ruine d. Harpending had unwittingly lured the richest men in 
the world into the bigge st scam of the century. 
Interpretation 
Amold and Slack pulled off their stupendous con not by using a fake engi­
neer or bribing Tiffany : All of the experts had been real. All of them hon­
estly believed in the existence of the mine and in the value of the gems. 
What had fooled them all was nothing else than Amold and Slack them­
selves. The two men seemed to be such rub es, such hayseeds, so naive, that 
no one for an instant had believed them capable of an audacious scam. 
The prospectors had simply observed the law of appearing more stupid 
than the mark-the deceiver's First Commandment. 
The logistics of the con were quite simple. Months before Amold and 
Slack announced the "discovery" of the diamond mine, they traveled to 
Europe, where they purchased some real gems for around $12,000 (part of 
the money they had saved from their days as gold miners) . They then 
salted the "mine" with these gems, which the first expert dug up and 
brought to San Francisco. The jewelers who had appraised these stones, in­
cluding Tiffany hirnself , had gotten caught up in the fever and had grossly 
overestimat ed their value. Then Ralston gave the prospectors $100,000 as 
security, and immediately after their trip to New York they simply went to 
Amsterdam, where they bought sacks of uncut gems, before retuming to 
San Francisco. The second time they salted the mine, there were many 
more jewels to be found. 
The effectiv eness of the scherne, however, rested not on tricks like 
these but on the fact that Amold and Slack played their parts to perfection. 
On their trip to New York, where they mingled with rnillionaires and ty­
coons, they played up their clodhopper image, wearing pants and coats a 
size or two too small and acting incredulous at everything they saw in the 
big city. No one believed that these country simpletons could possibly be 
conning the most devious, unscrupulous financiers of the time. And once 
Harpending, Ralston, and even Rothschild accepted the mine's existence, 
anyone who doubted it was questioning the intelligence of the world's most 
successful businessmen. 
In the end, Harpending' s reputation was ruined and he never recov­
ered; Rothschild leamed bis lesson and never fell for another con; Slack 
took his money and disappeared from view, never to be found. Amold 
simply went horne to Kentucky. After all, his sale of his mining rights had 
been legitima te; the buyers had taken the best advice, and if the mine had 
run out of diamonds, that was their problem. Amold used the money to 
greatly enlarge his farm and open up a bank of his OWll. 
KEY S TO POWER 
The feeling that someone else is more intelligent than we are is almost in­
tolerable. We usually try to justify it in different ways: "He only has book 
knowledge, whereas I have real knowledge ." "Her parents paid for her to 
get a good educatio n. If my parents had had as much money, if I had been 
as privileged .... " "He's not as smart as he thinks." Last but not least: "She 
may know her narrow little field better than I do, but beyond that she's re­
ally not smart at all. Even Einstein was a boob outside physics." 
Given how important the idea of intelligence is to most people's van­
ity, it is critical never inadvertently to insult or impugn a person's brain 
power. That is an unforgivable sin. But if you can make this iron rule work 
for you, it opens up all sorts of avenues of deception. Subliminally reassure 
people that they are more intelligent than you are, or even that you are a 
bit of amoron, and you can run rings around them. The feeling of intellec­
tual superiority you give them will disarm their suspicion-mu scles. 
In 1865 the Prussian councillor Otto von Bismarck wanted Austria to 
LAW 21 159 
160 LAW 21 sign a certain treaty. The treaty was totally in the interests of Prussia and 
against the interests of Austria, and Bismarck would have to strategize to 
get the Austrians to agree to it. But the Austrian negotiator, Count BIome, 
was an avid cardplayer. His particular game was quinze, and he often said 
that he could judge a man's character by the way he played quinze . Bis­
marck knew of this saying of BIome's. 
The night before the negotiations were to begin, Bismarck innocently 
engage d BIome in agame of quinze. The Prussian would later write, "That 
was the very last time lever played quinze . I played so recklessly that 
everyone was astonished. I lost several thousand talers [the currency of the 
time], but I succeeded in fooling [BIome], for he believed me to be more 
venture some than lama nd I gave way. " Besides appearing reckless, Bis­
marck also played the witless fool, saying ridiculous things and bumbling 
about with a surplus of nervous energy. 
All this made BIome feel he had gathered valuable inf ormation. He 
knew that Bismarck was aggressive--the Prussian already had that reputa­
tion, and the way he played had confirmed it. And aggressive men, BIome 
knew, can be foolish '.md rash. Accordingly, when the time came to sign 
the treaty, BIome thought he had the advantage . A heedless fool like Bis­
marck, he thought, is incapable of cold-blooded calculation and deception, 
so he only glanced at the treaty before signing it-he failed to read the fine 
print. As soon as the ink was dry, a joyous Bismarck exelaimed in his face, 
"WeIl, I could never have believed that I should find an Austrian diplomat 
willing to sign that document !" 
The Chinese have a phrase, "Masquer ading as a swine to kill the 
tiger." This refers to an ancient hunting technique in which the hunter 
elothes himself in the hide and snout of a pig, and mimics its grunting. The 
mighty tiger thinks a pig is coming his way, and lets it get elose, savoring 
the prospect of an easy meal. But it is the hunter who has the last laugh. 
Masquerading as a swine works wonders on those who, like tigers, are 
arrogant and overconfident: The easier they think it is to prey on you, the 
more easily you can turn the tables. This trick is also useful if you are ambi­
tious yet find yourself low in the hierarchy: Appearing less intelligent than 
you are, even a bit of a fool, is the perfect disguise. Look like a harmless pig 
and no one will believe you harbor dangero us ambitions. They may even 
promote you since you seem so likable, and subservient. Claudius before 
he became emperor of Rome, and the prince of France who later became 
Louis XIII, used this tactic when those above them suspected they might 
have designs on the throne. By playing the fool as young men, they were 
left alone. When the time came for them to strike, and to act with vigor and 
decisiveness, they caught everyone off-guard. 
Intelligence is the obvious quality to downplay, but why stop there? 
Taste and sophistica tion rank elose to intellig ence on the vanity scalej 
make people feel they are more sophisticated than you are and their guard 
will come down. As Arnold and Slack knew, an air of complete naivete can 
work wonders. Those fancy financiers were laughing at them behind their 
backs, but who laughed loudest in the end? In general, then, always make 
people believe they are smarter and more sophisticated than you are. They 
will keep you around because you make them feel beUer about themselves, 
and the longer you are around, the more opportunities you will have to de­
ceive them.

ugly, unintelligent, nervous little creature 
could be capable of such deception? 
Authority: Know how to make use of stupidity: The wisest man 
plays this card at times. There are occasions when the highest 
wisdom consists in appearing not to know-you must not be igno­
rant but capable of playing it. It is not much good being wise 
among fools and sane among lunatics. He who poses as a fool is not 
a fooI. The best way to be weIl received by all is to dothe YOUfself 
in the skin of the dumbest of brutes. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) 
REVERSAL 
To reveal the true nature of yoUf intelligence rarely pays; you should get in 
the habit of downplaying it at all times. If people inadvertently leam the 
truth-that you are actually much smarter than you look-they will admire 
you more for being discreet than for making YOUf brilliance show. At the 
start of your dimb to the top, of course, you cannot play too stupid: You 
may want to let YOUf bosses know, in a subtle way, that you are smarter 
than the competition around you. As you dimb the ladder, however, you 
should to some degree try to dampen YOUf brilliance. 
There is, however, one situation where it pays to do the opposite-­
when you can cover up a deception with a show of intelligence. In matters 
of smarts as in most things, appearances are what count. If you seem to 
have authority and knowledge, people will believe what you say. This can 
be very useful in getting you out of a scrape. 
The art dealer Joseph Duveen was once attending a soiree at the New 
York horne of a tycoon to whom he had recently sold a Dürer painting for 
LAW 21 161 
162 LAW 21 a high price. Among the guests was a young French art critic who seemed 
extremely knowledgeable and confident. Wanting to impress this man, the 
tycoon' s daughter showed him the Dürer, which had not yet been hung. 
The critic studied it for a time, then finally said, "You know, I don't think 
this Dürer is right." He followed the young woman as she hurried to tell 
her father what he had said, and listened as the magnate, deeply unsettled, 
tumed to Duveen for reassura nce. Duveen just laughed. "How very amus­
ing," he said. "Do you realize, young man, that at least twenty other art ex­
perts here and in Europe have been taken in too, and have said that 
painting isn't genuine? And now you've made the same mistake." His con­
fident tone and air of authority intimidated the Frenchman, who apolo­
gized for his mistake. 
Duveen knew that the art market was flooded with fakes, and that . 
many paintings had been falsely ascribed to old masters. He tried his best 
to distinguish the real from the fake, but in his zeal to seIl he often over­
played a work's authenticity. What mattered to him was that the buyer be­
lieved he had bought a Dürer, and that Duveen himself convinced 
everyone of his "expertness" through his air of irreproachable authority. 
Thus, it is important to be able to play the professor when necessary and 
never impose such an attitude for its own sake.

164 LAW 22 TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW 
The island of Melos is strategically situated in the heart of the Mediter­
ranean. In classical times, the city of Athens dominated the sea and coastal 
areas around Greece, but Sparta, in the Peloponnese, had been Melos's 
original colonizer. During the Peloponnesian War, then, the Melians re­
fused to ally themselves with Athens and remained loyal to Mother Sparta. 
In 416 B.C. the Athenians sent an expedition against Melos. Before launch­
ing an all-out attack, however, they dispatched adelegation to persuade the 
Melians to surrender and become an ally rather than suffer devastation and 
defeat. 
"You know as weIl as we do," the delegates said, "that the standard of 
justice depends on the equality of power to compel, and that in fact the 
strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they 
have to accept." When the Melians responded that this denied the notion 
of fair play, the Athenians said that those in power determined what was 
fair and what was not. The Melians argued that this authority belonged to 
the gods, not to mortals. "Our opinion of the gods and our knowledge of 
men," replied a member of the Athenian delegation, "lead us to conclude 
that it is a general and necessary law of nature to rule whatever one can." 
The Melians would not budge. Sparta, they insisted, would come to 
their defense. The Athenians countered that the Spartans were a conserva­
tive, practical people, and would not help Melos because they had nothing 
to gain and a lot to lose by doing so. 
Finally the Melians began to talk of honor and the principle of resisting 
brute force. "Do not be led astray by a false sense of honor," said the Athe­
nians. "Honor often brings men to ruin when they are faced with an obvi­
ous danger that somehow affects their pride. There is nothing disgraceful in 
giving way to the greatest city in Hellas when she is offering you such rea­
sonable terms." The debate ended. The Melians discussed the issue among 
themselves, and decided to trust in the aid of the Spartans, the will of the 
gods, and the rightness of their cause. They politely declined the Athenians' 
offer. 
A few days later the Athenians invaded Melos. The Melians fought 
nobly, even without the Spartans, who did not come to their rescue. It took 
several attempts before the Athenians could surround and besiege their 
main city, but the Melians finally surrendered. The Athenians wasted no 
time-they put to death all the men of military age that they could capture, 
they sold the women and children as slaves, and they repopulated the is­
land with their own colonists. Only a handful of Melians survived. 
Interpretation 
The Athenians were one of the most eminently practical people in history, 
and they made the most practical argument they could with the Melians: 
When you are weaker, there is nothing to be gained by fighting a useless 
fight. No one comes to help the weak-by doing so they would only put 
themselves in jeopardy. The weak are alone and must submit. Fighting 
gives you nothing to gain but martyrdom, and in the process a lot of people 
who do not believe in your cause will die. 
Weakness is no sin, and can even become a strength if you leam how 
to play it right. Had the Melians surrendered in the first place, they would 
have been able to sabotage the Athenians in subtle ways, or might have 
gotten what they could have out of the alliance and then left it when the 
Athenians themselves were weakened, as in fact happened several years 
later. Fortunes change and the mighty are often brought down. Surrender 
conceals great power: Lulling the enemy into complacency, it gives you 
time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge. Never sacrifice that 
time in exchange for honor in a battle that you cannot win. 
Weak people never give way when they ought to.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 
Sametime in the 1920s the German writer BertoIt Brecht became a convert 
to the cause of Communism. From then on his plays, essays, and poems re­
flected his revolutionary fervor, and he generally tried to make his ideolog­
ical statements as clear as possible. When Hitler came to power in 
Germany, Brecht and his Communist colleagues became marked men. He 
had many friends in the United States-Am ericans who sympathized with 
his beliefs, as well as fellow German intellectuals who had fled Hitler. In 
1941, accordingly, Brecht emigrated to the United States, and chose to set­
tle in Los Angeles, where he hoped to make a living in the film business. 
Over the next few years Brecht wrote screenplays with a pointedly an­
ticapitalist slant. He had little success in Hollywood, so in 1947, the war 
having ended, he decided to return to Europe. That same year, however, 
the U.S. Congress's House Un-American Activities Committee began its 
investigation into supposed Communist infiltration in Hollywood. It began 
to gatber information on Brecht, who had so openly espoused Marxism, 
and on September 19, 1947, only a month before he had planned to leave 
the United States, he received a subpoena to appear before the committee. 
In addition to Brecht, a number of other writers, producers, and directors 
were summoned to appear as well, and this group came to be known as the 
Hollywood 19. 
Before going to Washington, the Hollywood 19 met to decide on a plan 
of action. Their approach would be confrontational. Instead of answering 
questions about their membership, or lack of it, in the Communist Party, 
they would read prepared statements that would challenge the authority of 
the committee and argue that its activities were unconstitutional. Even if 
this strategy meant imprisonment, it would gain publicity for their cause. 
Brecht disagreed. What good was it, he asked, to play the martyr and 
gain a little public sympathy if in the process they lost the ability to stage 
their plays and sell their scripts for years to come? He feIt certain they were Voltaire was living in 
exile in London at a 
time when anti-French 
sentiment was at 
its highest. One day 
walking through the 
streets, he found himself 
surrounded by an 
angry crowd. "Hang 
him. Hang the French­
man," they yelled. 
Voltaire calmly 
addressed the mob with 
the fol!owing words: 
"Men of England! You 
wish to kill me because 
I am a Frenchman. Am 
I not punished enough 
in not being born an 
Englishman?" The 
crowd cheered his 
Ihoughtful words, and 
escorted him safely 
back 10 his lodgings.

166 LAW 22 all more intelligent than the members of the committ ee. Why lower them­
selves to the level of their opponents by arguing with them? Why not out­
fox the committee by appearing to surrender to it wbile subtly mocking it? 
The Hollywood 19 listened to Brecht politely, but decided to stick to their 
plan, leaving Brecht to go bis own way. 
The committee finally summoned Brecht on October 30. They ex­
pected hirn to do what others among the Hollywood 19 who had testified 
before hirn had done: Argue, refuse to answer questions, challenge the 
commit tee's right to hold its hearing, even yell and hurI insults. Much to 
their surprise, however, Brecht was the very picture of congeniality. He 
wore a suit (something he rarely did), smoked a cigar (he had heard that 
the committee chairman was a passionate cigar smoker) , answered their 
questions politely, and generally deferred to their authority. 
Unlike the other witnesses, Brecht answered the question of whether 
he belonged to the Communist Party: He was not a member, he said, 
which happened to be the truth. One committee member asked hirn, "Is it 
true you have written a number of revolutionary plays?" Brecht had writ­
ten many plays with overt Communist messages, but he responded, "I 
have written a number of poems and songs and plays in the fight against 
Hitler and, of course, they can be considered, therefore, as revolutionary 
because I, of course, was for the overthrow of that governmen t." This state­
ment went unchallenge d. 
Brecht' s English was more than adequate, but he used an interpreter 
throughout his testimony, a tactic that allowed hirn to play subtle games 
with language . When committee members found Communist leanings in 
lines from English editions of his poems, he would repeat the lines in Ger­
man for the interpreter, who would then retranslate them; and somehow 
they would c;ome out innocu ous. At one point a committee member read 
one of Brecht's revolutionary poems out loud in English, and asked hirn if 
he had written it. "No," he responded, "I wrote a German poem, wbich is 
very different from this." The author's elusive answers baffled the commit­
tee members, but his politeness and the way he yielded to their authority 
made it impossible for them to get angry with hirn. 
After only an hour of questioning, the committee members had had 
enough. "Thank you very muc h," said the chairman, "You are a good ex­
ample to the [other] witnesses." Not only did they free hirn, they off ered to 
help hirn if he had any trouble with immigration officials who might detain 
hirn for their own reasons. The following day, Brecht left the United States, 
never to return. 
Interpretation 
The Hollywood 19's confrontational approach won them a lot of sympa­
thy, and years later they gained a kind of vindication in public opinion. But 
they were also blacklisted, and lost valuable years of profitable working 
time. Brecht, on the other hand, expressed his disgust at the committee 
more indirectly. It was not that he changed his beliefs or compromised his 
values; instead, during his short testimony, he kept the upper hand by ap-
pearing to yield while all the time running cireles around the committee 
with vague responses, outright lies that went unchallenged because they 
were wra pped in enig mas, and word games. In the end he kept the free­
dom to continue his revolut ionary writing (as opposed to suffering impris­
onm ent or detainment in the United State s), even while subtly mocking the 
committee and its authority with his pseudo-obedience. 
Keep in mind the following: People trying to make a show of their au­
thority are easily deceived by the surrender tact ic. Your outward sign of 
subm ission makes them feel important; satisfied that you respect them, 
they become easier targets for a later counterattack, or for the kind of indi­
rect ridicule used by Brecht. Measuring your power over time, never sacri­
fice long-term maneuverability for the short-lived glories of marty rdom.

Ethiopian proverb 
KEYS TO POWER 
What gets us into trouble in the realm of power is often our own overreac­
tion to the moves of our enemies and riva ls. That overreaction creates 
problems we would have avo ided had we been more reasona ble. It also 
has an endless rebound effect, for the enemy then overreacts as well, much 
as the Athenians did to the Melia ns. It is always our first instinct to react, to 
meet agg ression with some other kind of agg ression. But the next time 
someone pushes you and you find yourself starting to react, try this: Do not 
resist or fight back, but yield, turn the other cheek, bend. You will find that 
this often neutralizes their beha vior-they expected, even wanted you to 
react with force and so they are caught off-g uard and confo unded by your 
lack of resista nce. By yielding, you in fact control the situation, because 
your surrender is part of a larger plan to lull them into believing they have 
defeated you. 
This is the essence of the surrender tact ic: Inwardly you stay firm, but 
outwardly you bend. Deprived of a reason to get angry, your opponents 
will often be bewildered instead. And they are unlikely to react with more 
violence, which would demand areaction from you. Instead you are al­
lowed the time and space to plot the countermoves that will bring them 
down. In the battle of the intelligent against the brutal and the agg ressive, 
the surrender tactic is the supreme weapon. It does require self-cont rol: 
Those who genuinely surrender give up their freedom, and may be 
crushed by the humiliation of their defeat. You have to remember that you 
only appear to surrender, like the animal that plays dead to save its hide. 
We have seen that it can be better to surrender than to fight; faced with 
a more powerful opponent and a sure defeat, it is often also better to sur­
render than to run away. Running away may save you for the time being, 
but the aggr essor will eventually catch up with you. If you surrender in­
stead, you have an opportunity to coil around your enemy and strike with 
your fangs from elose up. 
LAW 22 167 
168 LAW 22 In 473 B.C., in ancient China, King Gou jian ofYue suff ered a horrible 
defeat from the mler of Wu in the battle of Fujiao. Gou jian wanted to flee, 
but he had an adviser who told hirn to surrender and to place hirnself in the 
service of the mler of Wu , from which position he could study the man and 
plot his revenge . Deciding to follow this advice, Gou jian gave the mler all 
of his riches, and went to work in his conqueror' s stables as the lowest ser­
vant. For three years he humbled himself before the mler, who then, finally 
satisfied of his loyalty, allowed hirn to return horne. Inwardly, however, 
Gou jian had spent those three years gathering information and plotting re­
venge. When a terrible drought struck Wu , and the kingdom was weak­
ened by inner turmoil, he raised an army, invaded, and won with ease. 
That is the power behind sur render: It gives you the time and the flexibility 
to plot a devastating counter blow . Had Goujian mn away, he would have 
lost this cha nce. 
When foreign trade began to threaten Japanese independence in the 
mid-nineteenth century, the Japanese debated how to defeat the foreign­
ers. One minister, Hotta Masayoshi, wrote a memorandum in 1857 that in­
fluenced Japa nese policy for years to come: "I am therefore convinced that 
our policy should be to condude friendly allia nces, to send ships to foreign 
countries everywhere and conduct trade, to copy the foreigners where they 
are at their best and so repair our own shortcomings, to foster our national 
strength and complete our arm aments, and so gradually subject the foreign­
ers to our inf luence until in the end all the countries of the world know the 
blessings of perfect tranquillity and our hegemony is acknowledged 
throughout the globe ." This is a brilliant application of the Law: Use sur­
render to gain access to your enemy. Learn his ways, insinuate yourself 
with hirn slowly, outwardly conf orm to his customs, but inwardly maintain 
your own cultu re. Eventually you will emerge victorious, for while he con­
siders you weak and inferior, and takes no precautions against you, you are 
using the time to catch up and surpass him. This soft, permeable form of in­
vasion is often the best, for the enemy has nothing to react against, prepare 
for, or resist. And had Japan resisted Western influ ence by force, it might 
well have suff ered a devastating invasion that would have permanently al­
tered its culture . 
Surrender can also offer a way of mocking your enemies, of turning 
their power against them, as it did for Brecht. Milan Kundera's novel The 
Joke, based on the auth or's experien ces in a penal camp in Czechos lovakia, 
tells the story of how the prison guards organiz ed a relay race, guards 
against prisoners. For the guards this was a chance to show off their physi­
cal superiority. The prisoners knew they were expected to lose, so they 
went out of their way to oblige-miming exaggerated exertion while 
barely moving, mnning a few yards and collapsing, limping, jogging ever 
so slowly while the guards raced ahead at full speed. Both by joining the 
race and by losing it, they had obliged the guards obediently; but their 
"overobedience" had mocked the event to the point of mining it. Overobe­
dience-surrender-was here a way to demon strate superiority in a re­
verse manner. Resistance would have engaged the prisoners in the cyde of 
violence, lowering them to the guards' level. Overobeying the guards, how­
ever, made them ridiculous, yet they could not rightly punish the prison­
ers, who had only done what they asked. 
Power is always in flux-since the game is by nature fluid, and an arena 
of constant struggle, those with power almost always find themselves even­
tually on the downward swing. If you find yourself temporarily weakened, 
the surrender tactic is perfect for raising yourself up again-it disguises your 
ambition; it teaches you patience and self-control, key skills in the game; 
and it puts you in the best possible position for taking advantage ofyour op­
pressor's sudden slide. If you run away or fight back, in the long run you 
cannot win. If you surrender, you will almost always emerge victorious.

seems the only way out. Furthermore, if you are willing to die, others may 
gain power and inspiration from your example. 
Yet martyrdom, surrender 's reversal, is a messy, inexact tactic, and is 
as violent as the aggression it combats . For every famous martyr there are 
thousands more who have inspired neither areligion nor a rebellion, so 
that if martyrdom does sometimes grant a certain power, it does so unpre­
dictably. More important, you will not be around to enjoy that power, such 
as it iso And there is finally something selfish and arrogant about martyrs, 
as if they feit their followers were less important than their own glory. 
When power deserts you, it is best to ignore this Law' s reversal . Leave 
martyrdom alone: The pendulum will swing back your way eventually, 
and you should stay alive to see it.

172 LAW 23 TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW 
In China in the early sixth century B.C., the kingdom of Wu began a war 
with the neighboring northem provinces of the Middle Kingdom. Wu was 
a growing power, but it lacked the great history and civilization of the Mid­
dIe Kingdom, for centuries the center of Chinese culture. By defeating the 
Middle Kingdom, the king of Wu would instantly raise his status. 
The war began with great fanfare and several victories, but it soon 
bogged down. A victory on one front would leave the Wu armies vulnera­
ble on another. The king's chief minister and adviser, Wu Tzu-hsiu, wamed 
hirn that the barbarous state of Yueh, to the south, was beginning to notice 
the kingdom of Wu's problems and had designs to invade. The king only 
laughed at such worries-one more big victory and the great Middle King­
dom would be his. 
In the year 490, Wu Tzu-hsiu sent his son away to safety in the king­
dom of Ch'i. In doing so he sent the king a signal that he disapptoved of 
the war, and that he believed the king's selfish ambition was leading Wu to 
ruin. The king, sensing betrayal, lashed out at his minister, accusing hirn of 
a lack of loyalty and, in a fit of anger, ordered hirn to kill hirnself. Wu Tzu­
hsiu obeyed his king, but before he plunged the knife into his chest, he 
cried, "Tear out my eyes, oh King, and fix them on the gate of Wu, so that I 
may see the triumphant entry ofYueh." 
As Wu Tzu-hsiu had predicted, within a few years a Yueh army passed 
beneath the gate of Wu. As the barbarians surrounded the palace, the king 
remembered his minister's last words-and feit the dead man's disembod­
ied eyes watching his disgrace. Unable to bear his shame, the king killed 
hirnself, "covering his face so that he would not have to meet the reproach­
ful gaze ofhis minister in the next world." 
Interpretation 
The story of Wu is a paradigm of all the empires that have come to ruin by 
overreaching. Drunk with success and siek with ambition, such empires ex­
pand to grotesque proportions and meet a ruin that is total. This is what 
happened to ancient Athens, which lusted for the faraway island of Sicily 
and ended up losing its empire. The Romans stretched the boundaries of 
their empire to encompass vast territories; in doing so they increased their 
vulnerability, and the chances of invasion from yet another barbarian tribe. 
Their useless expansion led their empire into oblivion. 
For the Chinese, the fate of the kingdom of Wu serves as an elemental 
lesson on what happens when you dissipate your forces on several fronts, 
losing sight of distant dangers for the sake of present gain. "If you are not in 
danger," says Sun-tzu, "do not fight." It is almost a physical law: What is 
bloated beyond its proportions inevitably collapses. The mind must not 
wander from goal to goal, or be distracted by success from its sense of pur­
pose and proportion. What is concentrated, coherent, and connected to its 
past has power. What is dissipated, divided, and distended rots and falls to 
the ground. The bigger it bloats, the harder it falls. 
OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW 
The Rothschi ld banking family had hum ble beginnings in the Jewish 
ghetto of Frankfurt, Germany. The city's harsh laws made it impossible for 
Jews to mingle outside the ghetto, but the Jews had turned this into a 
virtue-it made them self-reliant, and zealous to preserve their culture at 
all costs. Mayer Amschel, the first of the Rothschilds to accumulate wealth 
by lending money, in the late eighteenth century, weIl understo od the 
power that comes from this kind of concentration and cohesion. 
First, Mayer Amschel allied hirnself with one family, the powernd 
princes of Thurn und Taxis. Instead of spreading his services out, he made 
himself these princes' primary banker. Second, he entrusted none of his 
busine ss to outsiders, using only his children and close relative s. The more 
unified and tight-knit the family, the more powerful it would become. Soon 
Mayer Amsche l's five sons were running the business. And when Mayer 
Amschel lay dying, in 1812, he refused to name a principal heir, instead set­
ting up all of his sons to continue ·the family tradition, so that they would 
stay united and would resist the dangers of diffusion and of infiltration by 
outsiders. 
Once Mayer Amsc hel's sons controlled the family business, they de­
cided that the key to wealth on a larger scale was to secure a foothold in the 
financ es of Europe as a whole , rather than being tied to any one country or 
prinee. Of the five brothers, Nathan had already opened up shop in Lon­
don. In 1813 James moved to Paris. Amsche l remained in Frankfurt, 
Salomon established hirnself in Vienna, and Karl, the youngest son, went 
to Naples. With each sphere of influence covered, they could tighten their 
hold on Euro pe's financial markets. 
This widespread network, of course, opened the Rothschilds to the 
very danger of which their father had warned them: diffusion, division, dis­
sension. They avoided this danger, and established themselves as the most 
powerful force in European finance and politics, by once again resorting to 
the strategy of the ghetto--excluding outsiders, concentrating their forces. 
The Rothschilds established the fastest courier system in Europe, allowing 
them to get news of events before all their competito rs. They held a virtual 
monopoly on informati on. And their internal communicat ions and corre­
spondence were written in Frankfurt Yiddish, and in a code that only the 
brothers could decipher. There was no point in stealing this information­
no one could understand it. "Even the shewdest bankers cannot find their 
way through the Rothschild maze," admitte d a financier who had tried to 
infiltrate the clan. 
In 1824 James Rothschild decided it was time to get marri ed. This pre­
sented a problem for the Rothschi lds, since it meant incorporating an out­
sider into the Rothschild clan, an outsider who could betray its secrets. 
James therefore decided to marry within the fami ly, and chose the daugh­
ter of his brother Salomon. The brothers were ecstatic-this was the per­
feet solution to their marriage problems. James's choice now became the 
family policy: Two years later, Nathan married off his daughter to hissing at everyone 
who passes by, you 
bring upon yourself the 
derision of all behold· 
ers. I confess that I am 
only formed to move 
upon the ground; but 
how graceful is my 
makel How weil turned 
my limbs! How highly 
finished my whole 
body! How great my 
strength! How aston­
ishing my speed! I had 
much rather be 
confined to one 
element, and be 
admired in that, than 
be a goose in all! "

families suff ered irrecoverable downturns during the tumultous first half of

Interpretati on 
The Roth schilds were born in strange times. They came from a place that 
had not changed in centu ries, but lived in an age that gave birth to the In­
dustrial Revolution, the French Revolution, and an endless series of up­
heavals. The Rothchilds kept the past aliv e, resisted the patterns of 
dispersion of their era and for this are emblematic of the law of conc entra­
tion. 
No one represents this better than James Roth schild, the son who es­
tablished himself in Pari s. In bis lifetime J ames witnessed the defeat of 
Napoleon, the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, the bourgeois monar­
chy of Orleans, the return to a republic, and finally the enthronement of 
Napoleo \ IH. French styles and fashions changed at a relent less pace dur­
ing all trus turmoil. Without appearing to be a relic of the past, J ames 
steered his family as if the ghetto lived on within them. He kept alive his 
clan's inner cohesion and strength. Only through such an anchoring in the 
past was the fam ily able to thrive amidst such chao s. Concentration was the 
foundation of the Rothschilds' power, wealth, and stability. 
The best strate gy is always to be very strong; first in general, then 
at the decis ive point .... There is no higher and simpler law of strate gy 
than that of keeping one's forces concentrated .... In short the 
first principle is: act with the utmost concentrati on. 
On War, Carl von Clausewitz, 1780-18 31 
KEYS TO PO WER 
The world is plagued by greater and greater divisi on-within countries, 
political group s, fam ilies, even individual s. We are all in astate of total dis­
traction and diffusion, hardly able to keep our minds in one direction be­
fore we are pulled in a thousand others. The modem world' s level of 
conflict is higher than ever, and we have internalized it in our own li ves. 
The solution is a form of retreat inside ourselves, to the past, to more 
concentrated forms of thought and actio n. As Schopenhauer wrote, "Intel­
lect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of extensi ty." Napoleon 
knew the value of concentrating your forces at the enem y's weakest spot -
it was the secret of his success on the battlefield. But his willpower and his 
mind were equally modeled on this notion. Single-mindedness of purpose, 
total concentration on the goal, and the use of these qualities against peo­
pIe less focused, people in astate of distraction-such an arrow will find its 
mark every time and overwhelm the enemy. 
Casanova attributed his success in life to his ability to concentrate on a 
single goal and push at it until it yielded. It was his ability to give hirnself 
over completely to the women he desired that made hirn so intensely se­
ductive. For the weeks or months that one of these women lived in his 
orbit, he thought of no one else. When he was imprisoned in the treacher­
ous "leads" of the doge's palace in Venice, a prison from which no one had 
ever escaped, he concentrated his mind on the single goal of escape, day 
after day. A change of cells, which meant that months of digging had all 
been for naught, did not discourage hirn; he persisted and eventually es­
caped. "I have always believed," he later wrote, "that when a man gets it 
into his head to do something, and when he exclusively occupies hirnself in 
that design, he must succeed, whatever the difficulties. That man will be­
come Grand Vizier or Pope." 
Concentrate (,la single goal, a single task, and beat it into submission. 
In the world of power you will constantIy need help from other people, 
usually those more powerful than you. The fool flits from one person to an­
other, believing that he will survive by spreading hirnself out. It is a corol­
lary of the law of concentration, however, that much energy is saved, and 
more power is attained, by affixing yourself to a single, appropriate source 
of power. The scientist Nikola Tesla ruined hirnself by believing that he 
somehow maintained his independence by not having to serve a single 
master. He even turned down J. P. Morgan, who offered hirn a rich con­
tract. In the end, Tesla's "independence" meant that he could depend on 
no single patron, but was always having to toady up to a dozen of them. 
Later in his life he realized his mistake. 
All the great Renaissance painters and writers wrestIed with this prob­
lem, none more so than the sixteenth-century writer Pietro Aretino. 
Throughout his life Aretino suffered the indignities of having to pIe ase this 
prince and that. At last, he had had enough, and decided to woo Charles 
V, promising the emperor the services of his powerful pen. He finally dis­
covered the freedom that came from attachment to a single source of 
power. Michelangelo found this freedom with Pope Julius H, Galileo with 
the Medicis. In the end, the single patron appreciates your loyalty and be­
comes dependent on your serv ices; in the long run the master serves the 
slave. 
Finally, power itself always exists in concentrated forms. In any orga­
nization it is inevitable for a small group to hold the strings. And often it is 
not those with the titIes. In the game of power, only the fool flails about 
without fixing his target. You must find out who controls the operations, 
who is the real director behind the scenes. As Richelieu discovered at the 
beginning of his rise to the top of the French political scene during the 
LAW 23 175 
176 LAW 23 early seventeenth century, it was not King Louis XIII who decided things, 
it was the king's mother. And so he attached hirnself to her, and catapulted 
through the ranks of the courtiers, all the way to the top. 
It is enough to strike oil once-your wealth and power are assured for 
a lifetime. 
Image: The Arrow. You cannot hit two targets 
with one arrow. If your thoughts stray, you 
miss the enemy's heart. Mind and 
arrow must become one. Only 
with such concentration of 
mental and physica l 
power can your arrow 
hit the target and 
pierce the 
heart. 
Authority: Prize intensity more than extensity. Perfection re­
sides in quality, not quantity. Extent alone never rises above 
mediocrity, and it is the misfortune of men with wide general 
interests that while they would like to have their finger in every 
pie, they have one in none. Intensity gives eminen ce, and rises 
to the heroic in matters sublime. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) 
REVERSAL 
There are dangers in concentration, and moments when dispersion is the 
proper tactical move. Fighting the Nationalists for control of China, Mao 
Tse-tung and the Communists fought a protracted war on several fronts, 
using sabotage and ambush as their main weapons. Dispersal is often suit­
able for the weaker side; it is, in fact, a crucial principle of guerrilla warfare. 
When fighting a stronger army, concentrating YOUf forces only makes you 
an easier target-better to dissolve into the scenery and frustrate your 
enemy with the elusiveness of YOUf presence. 
Tying YOUfself to a single SOUfce of power has one preeminent danger: 
If that person dies, leaves, or falls from grace, you suff er. This is what hap­
pened to Cesare Borgia, who derived his power from his father, Pope 
Alexander VI. It was the pope who gave Cesare armies to fight with and 
wars to wage in his name. When he suddenly died (perhaps from poison) , 
Cesare was as good as dead. He had made far too many enemies over the 
years, and was now without his father's protection. In cases when you may 
need protection, then, it is often wise to entwine YOUfseif around several 
sources of power. Such a move would be especially prudent in periods of 
great tumult and violent change, or when YOUf enemies are numerous. The 
more patrons and masters you serve the less risk you run if one of them 
falls from power. Such dispersion will even allow you to play one off 
against the other. Even if you concentrate on the single SOUfce of power, 
you still must practice caution, and I cepare for the day when YOUf master 
or patron is no longer there to help you. 
Finally, being too single-minded in purpose can make you an intolera­
ble bore, especially in the arts. The Renaissance painter Paolo Uccello was 
so obsessed with perspective that his paintings look lifeless and contrived. 
Whereas Leonardo da Vinci interested himself in everything -architec­
ture, painting, warfare, sculpture , mechanics. Diffusion was the source of 
his power. But such genius is rare, and the rest of us are better off erring on 
the side of intensity.

PLAY THE PERFECT 
CO URTIER 
JUDGMENT 
The perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything 
revolves around power and political dexterity. He has 
mastered the art of indirection; he flatters, yields to supe­
riors, and asserts power over others in the most oblique 
and gracejul manner. Learn and apply the laws of 
courtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can 
rise in the court. 
COUR T SOCIE TY 
It is a fact of human nature t�.J.t the structure of a court society forms itself 
around power. In the past;' llie court gathered around the roler, and had 
many functions: Besides keeping the roler amused, it was a way to solidify 
the hierarchy of royalty, nobility, and the upper classes, and to keep the 
nobility both sub ordinate and elose to the ruler, so that he could keep an 
eye on them. The court serves power in many ways, but most of all it glori­
fies the roler, providing him with a microcosmic world that must struggle 
to pIe ase him. 
To be a courtier was a dangerous game. A nineteenth-century Arab 
traveler to the court of Darfur, in what is now Sudan, reported that 
courtiers there had to do whatever the sultan did: If he were injured, they 
had to suffer the same injury; if he fell off his horse during a hunt, they fell, 
too. Mimicry like this appeared in courts all over the world. More trouble­
same was the danger of displeasing the roler-one wrong move spelled 
death or exile. The successful courtier had to walk a tightrope, pleasing but 
not pleasing too much, obeying but somehow distinguishing himself from 
the other courtiers, while also never distinguishing himself so far as to 
make the roler insecure . 
Great courtiers throughout history have mastered the science of ma­
nipulating people. They make the king feel more kingly; they make every­
one else fear their power. They are magicians of appearance, knowing that 
most things at court are judged by how they seem. Great courtiers are gra­
cious and polite; their aggression is veiled and indirect. Masters of the 
word, they never say more than necessa ry, getting the most out of a com­
pliment or hidden insult. They are magnets of pleasure- people want to be 
around them because they know how to please, yet they neither fawn nor 
humiliate themsel ves. Great courtiers become the king's favorites, enjoying 
the benefits of that position. They often end up more powernd than the 
ruler, for they are wizards in the accumulation of influence. 
Many today dismiss court life as a relic of the past, a historical curios­
ity. They reason, according to Machiavelli, "as though heaven, the sun, the 
elements, and men had change d the order of their motions and power, and 
were different from what they were in ancient times." There may be no 
more Sun Kings but there are still plenty of people who believe the sun re­
volves around them. The royal court may have more or less disappeared, 
or at least lost its power, but courts and courtiers still exist because power 
still exists. A courtier is rarely asked to fall off a horse anymore, but the 
laws that govem court politics are as timeless as the laws of power. There is 
much to be leamed, then, from great courtiers past and present.

180 LAW 24 the more suspicion you cau se. You also stir up enough envy among your 
peers to induce treachery and backstabbing. Be careful, ever so careful, in 
trump eting your own achievements, and always talk less ab out yourself 
than about other people. Modesty is generally pref erable. 
Practice Nonchalan ce. Never seem to be working too hard. Your talent 
must appear to flow naturally, with an ease that makes people take you for 
a genius rath er than a workaholic. Even when something demands a lot of 
sweat, make it look effortless- people prefer to not see your blood and toil, 
which is another form of ostentat ion. It is better for them to marvel at how 
grac efully you have achie ved your accomplishment than to wonder why it 
took so much work. 
Be Frugal with Flatte ry. It may seem that your superiors cannot get 
enough flattery, but too much of even a good thing loses its valu e. It also 
stirs up suspicion among your peers. Leam to flatter indirect ly-by down­
playing your own contribution, for exam ple, to make your master look bet­
ter. 
Arrange to Be Noticed. There is a parad ox: You cannot display yourself 
too brazenly, yet you must also get yourself noticed. In the court of Louis 
XIV, whoever the king decided to look at rose instantly in the court hierar­
chy. You stand no chance of rising if the ruler does not notice you in the 
swamp of court iers. This task requires much art. It is often initially a matter 
of being seen, in the literal sense. Pay atte ntion to your physical appear­
ance, then, and find a way to create a distinctive-a subtly distinctive -style 
and image. 
Alter Your Style and Language According to the Person You Are 
Dealing With . The pseudo-belief in equal ity-th e idea that talking and 
acting the same way with everyone, no matter what their rank, makes you 
somehow a paragon of civiliza tion-is a terrible mista ke. Those below you 
will take it as a form of condescension, which it is, and those above you will 
be offen ded, although they may not admit it. You must change your style 
and your way of speak ing to suit each person. This is not lying, it is acting; 
and acting is an art, not a gift from God. Leam the art. This is also true for 
the great variety of cultures found in the modem court: Never assume that 
your criteria of behavior and judgment are univer sal. Not only is an inabil­
ity to adapt to anoth er culture the height of barbarism, it puts you at a dis­
advanta ge. 
Never Be the Bearer of Bad News. The king kills the messenger who 
brings bad news: This is a diche but there is truth to it. You must struggle 
and if necessary lie and cheat to be sure that the lot of the bearer of bad 
news falls on a colleague, never on you. Bring only good news and your 
approach will gladden your master. 
Never Aff ect Friendliness and Intirnacy with Your Master . He does 
not want a friend for a subordinate, he wants a sub ordinate. Never ap­
proach hirn in an easy, friendly way, or act as if you are on the best of 
terrns-that is his prerogative. If he chooses to deal with you on this level, 
assume a wary chumminess. Otherwise err in the opposite direction, and 
make the distance between you clear. 
Never Criticize Those Above You Dire ctly. This may seem obvious, 
but there are often times when some sort of criticism is necessary-to say 
nothing, or to give no advice, would open you to risks of another sort. You 
must leam, however, to couch YOUf advice and criticism as indirectly and as 
politely as possible. Think twice, or three times, before deciding you have 
made them sufficiently circuitous. Err on the side of subtlety and gentleness. 
Be Frugal in Asking Those Above You for Favors. Nothing irritates a 
master more than having to reject someone's request. It stirs up guilt and 
resentment. Ask for favors as rarely as possible, and know when to stop. 
Rather than making YOUfself the supplicant, it is always better to eam YOUf 
favors, so that the ruler bestows them willingly. Most important: Do not ask 
for favors on another person's behalf, least of all a friend's. 
Never Joke About Appearances or Taste. A lively wit and a humorous 
disposition are essential qualities for a good courtier, and there are times 
when vulgarity is appropriate and engaging. But avoid any kind of joke 
about appearance or taste, two highly sensitive areas, especially with those 
above you. Do not even try it when you are away from them. You will dig 
YOUf OWD grave. 
Do Not Be the Court Cynic. Express admiration for the good work of 
others. If you constantly criticize YOUf equals or subordinates some of that 
criticism will rub off on you, hovering over you like a gray cloud wherever 
you go. People will groan at each new cynical comment, and you will irri­
tate them. By expressing modest admiration for other people's achieve­
ments, you paradoxically call attention to your OWD. The ability to express 
wonder and amazement, and seem like you mean it, is a rare and dying tal­
ent, but one still greatly valued. 
Be Self -obs ervant. The mirror is a miraculous invention; without it you 
would commit great sins against beauty and decorum. You also need a mir­
ror for your actions. This can sometimes come from other people telling 
you what they see in you, but that is not the most trustworthy method: You 
must be the mirror, training your mind to try to see YOUfself as others see 
you. Are you acting too obsequious? Are you trying too hard to please? Do 
you seem desperate for attention, giving the impression that you are on the 
decline? Be observant about YOUfself and you will avoid a mountain of 
blunders. 
LAW 24 181 
182 LAW 24 Master Your Emotions. As an actor in a great play, you must leam to cry 
and laugh on command and when it is appropria te. You must be able both 
to disguise your anger and frustration and to fake your contentment and 
agreement. You must be the master of your own face. Call it lying if you 
like; but if you prefer to not play the game and to always be honest and up­
front, do not complain when others call you obnoxious and arrogant. 
Fit the Spirit of the Times. A slight affeetation of a past era can be 
charming, as long as you choose aperiod at least twenty years back; wear­
ing the fashions of ten years ago is ludicrous, unless you enjoy the role of 
court jester. Your spirit and way of thinking must keep up with the times, 
even if the times offend your sensibilit ies. Be too forward-thinking, how­
ever, and no one will understand you. It is never a good idea to stand out 
too much in this area; you are best off at least being able to mimic the spirit 
of the times. 
Be a Source of Pleasure. This is critical. It is an obvious law of human 
nature that we will flee what is unpleasant and distasteful, while charm and 
the promise of delight will draw us like moths to a flame. Make yourself the 
flame and you will rise to the top. Since life is otherwise so full of unpleas­
antness and pleasure so scarce, you will be as indispensable as food and 
drink. This may seem obvious, but what is obvious is often ignored or un­
appreciated. There are degrees to this: Not everyone can play the role of 
favorite, for not everyone is blessed with charm and wit. But we can all 
control our unpleasant qualities and obscure them when necessa ry. 
A man who knows the court is master of his gestures, of his eyes and 
of his face; he is profound, impenet rable; he dissimu lates bad offices, 
smiles at his enemies, controls his irritation, disgu ises his passions, 
belies his heart, speaks and acts against his feelings.

SCENES OF COUR T LIFE: Exemplary Deeds and Fatal Mistakes 
Scene I 
Alexander the Great, conqueror of the Mediterranean basin and the Mid­
dIe East through to India, had had the great Aristotle as his tutor and men­
tor, and throughout his short life he remain ed devoted to philosophy and 
his master's teachings . He once complained to Aristotle that during his 
long campaigns he had no one with whom he could discuss philosophical 
matters. Aristotle responded by suggesting that he take Callisthenes, a for­
mer pupil of Aristotl e's and a promising philosopher in his own right, 
along on the next campaign. 
Aristotle had schooled Callisth enes in the skills ofbeing a courtier, but 
the young man secretly scoffed at them. He believed in pure philosophy, in 
unadorn ed words, in speaking the naked truth. If Alexander loved learning 
so much, Callisthenes thought, he could not object to one who spoke his 
mind. During one of Alexander's ma jor campaig ns, Call isthenes spoke his 
mind one too many times and Alexander had him put to death. 
Interpretati on 
In court, honesty is a fool's game. Never be so self-absorbed as to believe 
that the master is interested in your criticisms of hirn, no matter how accu­
rate they are. 
Scene II 
Beginning in the Han Dynasty two thousand years ago, Chinese scholars 
compiled aseries ofwritings called the 27 Histories, an official biography of 
each dynasty, including stor ies, stati stics, census figure s, and war chroni­
des. Each history also contained a chapter called "Unusual Eve nts," and 
here, among the listings of earth quakes and floods, there would sometimes 
sudde nly appear descriptions of such bizarre manif estations as two-headed 
sheep, geese flying backward, stars suddenly appearing in different parts of 
the sky, and so on. The earthquakes could be historically verifie d, but the 
monsters and weird natural phenomena were clearly inserted on purpose, 
and invari ably occurred in clusters. What could this mean? 
The Chi nese emperor was considered more than a man-he was a 
force of nature. His kingdom was the center of the univ erse, and every­
thing revo lved around hirn. He embodied the world's perf ection. To criti­
cize hirn or any of his actions would have been to criticize the divine order. 
No minister or courtier dared approach the emperor with even the slighte st 
cauti onary word. But emperors were fallible and the kingdom suffered 
greatly by their mistak es. Inserting sightings of strange phenomena into the 
court chroni cles was the only way to warn them. The emperor would read 
of geese flying backward and moons out of orbit, and realize that he was 
being caut ioned. His actions were unbalancing the universe and needed to 
change . 
Interp retat ion 
For Chi nese courtiers, the problem of how to give the emperor advice was 
an important issue. Over the years, thousands of them had died trying to 
warn or counsel their master. To be made safely, their criti cisms had to be 
indirect-yet if they were too indirect they would not be heeded. The 
chro nicles were their solut ion: Identify no one person as the source of criti­
cism, make the advi ce as impersonal as possible, but let the emperor know 
the gravity of the situa tion. 
Your master is no longer the center of the univ erse, but he still imag­
ines that everything revolves around hirn. When you criticize hirn he sees 
the person criticizing, not the criticism itself. Like the Chinese courtiers, 
you must find a way to disappear behind the warning. Use symbols and 
other indirect methods to paint a picture of the problems to come, without 
putting your neck on the line. 
LAW 24 183 
184 LAW 24 Scene III 
Early in his career, the French architect Jules Mansart received commis­
sions to design minor additions to Versailles for King Louis XIV. For each 
design he would draw up his plans, making sure they followed Louis's in­
structions closely. He would then present them to His Majesty. 
The courtier Saint-Simon described Mansart's technique in dealing 
with the king: "His particular skill was to show the king plans that pur­
posely included something imperfect about them, often dealing with the 
gardens, which were not Mansart's specialty. The king, as Mansart ex­
pected, would put his finger exactly on the problem and propose how to 
solve it, at which point Mansart would exclaim for all to hear that he would 
never have seen the problem that the king had so masterfully found and 
solved; he would burst with admiration, confessing that next to the king he 
was but a lowly pupil." At the age of thirty, having used these methods 
time and time again, Mansart received a prestigious royal commission : Al­
though he was less talented and experienced than a number of other 
French designers, he was to take charge of the enlargement of Versailles. 
He was the king's architect from then on. 
Interpretation 
As a young man, Mansart had seen how many royal craftsmen in the ser­
vice of Louis XIV had lost their positions not through a lack of talent but 
through a costly social blunder. He would not make that mistake. Mansart 
always strove to make Louis feel better about hirnself, to feed the king's 
vanity as publicly as possible. 
Never imagine that skill and talent are all that matter. In court the 
courtier's art is more important than his talent; never spend so much time 
on your studies that you neglect your social skills. And the greatest skill of 
all is the ability to make the master look more talented than those around 
hirn. 
Scene IV 
Jean-Baptiste Isabey had become the unofficial painter of the Napole onic 
court. During the Congress of Vienna in 1814, after Napoleon, defeated, 
had been imprisoned on the island of Elba, the participants in these meet­
ings, which were to decide the fate of Europe, invited Isabey to immortal­
ize the historie events in an epic painting. 
When Isabey arrived in Vienna, Talleyrand, the main negotiator for 
the French, paid the artist a visit. Considering his role in the procee dings, 
the statesman explained, he expected to occupy center stage in the paint­
ing. Isabey cordially agreed. A few days later the Duke of Wellington, the 
main negotiator for the English, also approached Isabey, and said much 
the same thing that Talleyrand had. The ever polite Isabey agreed that the 
great duke should indeed be the center of attention. 
Back in his studio, Isabey pondered the dilemma. If he gave the spot­
light to either of the two men, he could create a diplomatie rift, stirring up 
all sorts of resentrnent at a time when peace and concord were critical. 
When the painting was finally unve iled, however, both Talleyrand and 
Wel lington feIt honored and satisfied. The work depicts a large hall filled 
with diplomats and politicians from all over Euro pe. On one side the Duke 
of Wellington enters the room, and all eyes are turned toward him; he is 
the "center" of atten tion. In the very center of the painting, meanwhil e, sits 
Talleyran d. 
Inter pretation 
It is often very difficult to satisfy the master, but to satisfy two masters in 
one stroke takes the genius of a great courtier. Such predicaments are com­
mon in the life of a court ier: By giving attention to one master, he dis­
pleases another. You must find a way to navigate this Scylla and Charybdis 
safely. Masters must receive their due; never inadvertently stir up the re­
sentment of one in pleasing another. 
Scene V 
George Brummell, also known as Beau Brummell, made his mark in the 
late 1700s by the supreme elegance of his appearanc e, his popularization of 
shoe buckles (soon imitated by all the dandies), and his clever way with 
words . His London house was the fashionable spot in town, and Brummell 
was the authority on all matters of fash ion. If he disliked your footwear, 
you immediately got rid of it and bought whatever he was wearing. He per­
feeted the art of tying a cravat; Lord Byron was said to spend many a night 
in front of the mirror trying to figure out the secret behind Brumm ell's per­
feet kno ts. 
One of Brumme ll's greatest admirers was the Prince of Wal es, who 
fancied himself a fashionable young man. Becoming attach ed to the 
prince 's court (and provided with a royal pension), Brummell was soon so 
sure of his own authority there that he took to joking about the prince's 
weight, referring to his host as Big Ben. Since trimne ss of figure was an im­
portant quality for a dandy, this was a withering criti cism. At dinner once, 
when the service was slow, Brummell said to the prince, "Do ring, Big 
Ben. " The prince rang, but when the valet arrived he ordered the man to 
show Brum mell the door and never admit him aga in. 
Despite falling into the prince's disfavor, Brummell continued to treat 
everyone around him with the same arrogance. Without the Prince of 
Wales' patronage to support him, he sank into horrible debt, but he main­
tained his insolent manners, and everyone so on abandoned him. He died 
in the most pitia ble poverty, alone and deranged. 
Interpretat ion 
Beau Brum mell's devastating wit was one of the qualities that endeared 
him to the Prince ofW ales. But not even he, the arbiter oftaste and fashion, 
could get away with a joke about the prince's app earance, least of all to his 
face. Never joke about a person's plumpness, even indire ctly-and particu­
lady when he is your master. The poorhouses of history are filled with peo­
pIe who have made such jokes at their master's expense. 
LAW 24 185 
186 LAW 24 Scene VI 
Pope Urban VIIIwanted to be remembered for his skiUs in writing poetry, 
which unfortunately were mediocre at best. In 1629 Duke Francesco 
d'Este, knowing the pope's literary pretensions, sent the poet Fulvio Testi 
as his ambassador to the Vatican. One of Testi's letters to the duke reveals 
why he was chosen: "Once our discussion was over, I kneeled to depart, 
but His Holiness made a signal and walked to another room where he 
sleeps, and after reaching a small table, he grabbed a bundle of papers and 
thus, tuming to me with a smiling face, he said: 'We want Your Lordship to 
listen to some of our compositions .' And, in fact, he read me two very long 
Pindaric poems, one in praise of the most holy Virgin, and the other one 
ab out Countess Matilde." 
We do not know exactly what Testi thought of these very long poems, 
since it would have been dangerous for hirn to state his opinion freely, 
even in a letter. But he went on to write, "I, following the mood, com­
mented on each line with the needed praise, and, after having kissed His 
Holiness's foot for such an unusual sign of benevolence [the reading of the 
poetry], I left." Weeks later, when the duke hirnself visited the pope, he 
managed to recite entire verses of the pope's poetry and praised it enough 
to make the pope "so jubilant he seemed to lose his mind." 
Interpretation 
In matters of taste you can never be too obsequious with your master. Ta ste 
is one of the ego's prickliest parts; never impugn or question the master's 
taste-his poetry is sublime, his dress impeccable, and his manner the 
model for all. 
Scene VII 
One aftemoon in ancient China, Chao, ruler of Han from 358 to 333 B.C., 
got drunk and fell asleep in the palace gardens. The court crown-keeper, 
whose sole task was to look after the ruler's head apparel, passed through 
the gardens and saw his master sleeping without a coat. Since it was getting 
cold, the crown-keeper placed his own coat over the ruler, and left. 
When Chao awoke and saw the coat upon hirn, he asked his atten­
dants, "Who put more clothes on my body?" "The crow n-keeper," they 
replied. The ruler immediately called for his official coat-keeper and had 
hirn punished for neglecting his duties. He also called for the crown­
keeper, whom he had beheaded. 
Interpretation 
Do not overstep your bounds. Do what you are assigned to do, to the best 
of your abilities, and never do more. To think that by doing more you are 
doing better is a common blunder. It is never good to seem to be trying too 
hard-it is as if you were covering up some deficiency. Fulfilling a task that 
has not been asked of you just makes people suspicious. If you are a crown­
keeper, be a crown-keeper. Save your excess energy for when you are not 
in the court. 
Scene VIII 
One day, for amusement, the Italian Renaissance painter Fra Filippo Lippi 
(1406-1469) and some friends went sailing in a small boat off Ancona. 
There they were captured by two Moorish galleys, which hauled them off 
in chains to Barbary, where they were sold as slaves. For eighteen long 
months Filippo toiled with no hope of returning to ltaly. 
On several occasions Filippo saw the man who had bought hirn pass 
by, and one day he decided to sketch this man's portrait, using burnt 
coal-charcoal-from the fire. Still in his chains, he found a white wall, 
where he drew a full-Iength likeness of his owner in Moorish clothing. The 
owner so on heard about this, for no one had seen such skill in drawing be­
fore in these parts; it seemed like a miracle, a gift from God. The drawing 
so pleased the owner that he instantly gave Filippo his freedom and em­
ployed hirn in his court. All the big men on the Barbary coast came to see 
the magnificent color portraits that Fra Filippo then proceeded to do, and 
finally, in gratitude for the honor in this way brought upon hirn, Filippo's 
owner returned the artist safely to ltaly. 
Interpretation 
We who toil for other people have all in some way been captured by pi­
rates and sold into slavery. But like Fra Filippo (if to a lesser degree), most 
of us possess some gift, same talent, an ability to do something better than 
other people. Make your master a gift of YOUf talents and you will rise 
above other courtiers. Let hirn take the credit if necessary, it will only be 
temporary: Use hirn as a stepping stone, a way of displaying your talent 
and eventually buying your freedom from enslavement. 
Scene IX 
Alfonso 1 of Aragon once had a servant who told the king that the night 
before he had had a dream: Alfonso had given hirn a gift of weapons, 
horses, and clothes. Alfonso, a generous, lordly man, decided it would be 
amusing to make this dream come true, and promptly gave the servant 
exaetly these gifts. 
A little while later, the same servant announced to Alfonso that he had 
had yet another dream, and in this one Alfonso had given hirn a consider­
able pile of gold florins. The king smiled and said, "Don't believe in 
dreams from now on; they He." 
Interpretation 
In his treatment of the servant's first dream, Alfonso remained in control. 
By making a dream come true, he claimed a godlike power for hirnself, if 
in a mild and humorous way. In the second dream, however, all appear­
anee of magic was gone; this was no thing but an ugly con game on the ser­
vant's part. Never ask for too much, then, and know when to stop. It is the 
master's prerogative to give-to give when he wants and what he wants, 
and to do so without prompting. Do not give hirn the chance to reject your 
requests. Better to win favors by deserving them, so that they are bestowed 
without your asking. 
LAW 24 187 
188 LAW 24 Scene X 
The great English landscape painter J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851) was 
known for his use of color, which he applied with a brilliance and a strange 
iridescence. The color in his paintings was so striking, in fact, that other 
artists never wanted his work hung next to theirs: It inevitably made every­
thing around it seem dull. 
The painter Sir Thomas Lawrence once had the misfortune of seeing 
Turner's masterpiece Cologne hanging in an exhibition between two works 
of his own. Lawrence complained bitterly to the gallery owner, who gave 
hirn no satisfaction: After all, someone's paintings had to hang next to 
Turner's. But Turner heard of Lawrence's complaint, and before the exhibi­
tion opened, he toned down the brilliant golden sky in Cologne, making it as 
dull as the colors in Lawrence's works. A friend of Turner's who saw the 
painting approached the artist with a horrified look: "What have you done 
to your picture!" he said. "Well, poor Lawrence was so unhappy," Turner 
replied, "and it's only larnpblack. It'll wash off after the exhibition." 
Interpretation 
Many of a courtier's anxieties have to do with the master, with whom most 
dangers lie. Yet it is amistake to imagine that the master is the only one to 
detennine your fate. Your equals and subordinates play integral parts also. 
A court is a vast stew of resentments, fears, and powernd envy. You have to 
placate everyone who might someday hann you, deflecting their resent­
ment and envy and diverting their hostility onto other people. 
Turner, eminent courtier, knew that his good fortune and farne de­
pended on his fellow painters as well as on his dealers and patrons. How 
many of the great have been felled by envious colleagues! Better temporar­
ily to dull your brilliance than to suffer the slings and arrows of envy. 
Scene XI 
Winston Churchill was an amateur artist, and after World War 11 his paint­
ings became collector's items. The American publisher Henry Luce, in 
fact, creator of Time and Lift magazines, kept one of Churchill's landscapes 
hanging in his private office in New York. 
On a tour through the United States once, Churchill visited Luce in his 
office, and the two men looked at the painting together. The publisher re­
marked, "It's a good picture, but I think it needs something in the fore­
ground-a sheep, perhaps." Much to Luce's horror, Churchill 's secretary 
called the publisher the next day and asked hirn to have the painting sent 
to England. Luce did so, mortified that he had perhaps offended the former 
prime minister. A few days later, however, the painting was shipped back, 
but slightly altered: a single sheep now grazed peacefully in the fore­
ground. 
Interpretation 
In stature and farne, Churchill stood head and shoulders above Luce, but 
Luce was certainly a man of power, so let us imagine a slight equality be­
tween them. Still, what did Churchill have to fear from an American pub­
lisher? Why bow to the criticism of a dilettante ? 
A court-in this case the entire world of diplomats and intemational 
statesmen, and also of the joumalists who court them-is a place of mutual 
dependence. It is unwise to insult or offend the taste of people of power, 
even if they are below or equal to you. If a man like Churchill can swallow 
the criticisms of a man like Luce, he proves hirns elf a courtier without peer. 
(Perhaps his correction of the painting implied a certain condescension as 
weIl, but he did it so subtly that Luce did not perceive any slight.) Imitate 
Churchill: Put in the sheep. It is always beneficial to play the obliging 
courtier, even when you are not serving a master. 
TRE DELICATE GAME OF COURTIERSHIP: A Waming 
Talleyrand was the consummate courtier, especially in serving his master 
Napoleon. When the two men were first getting to know each other, 
Napoleon once said in passing, "I shall come to lunch at your house one of 
these days." Talleyrand had a house at Auteuil, in the suburbs of Paris. "I 
should be delighted, mon general," the minister replied, "and since my 
house is elose to the Bois de Boulogne, you will be able to amuse yourself 
with a bit of shooting in the aftemoon." 
"I do not like shooting," said Napoleon, "But I love hunting. Are there 
any boars in the Bois de Boulogne ?" Napoleon came from Corsica, where 
boar hunting was a great sport. By asking if there were boars in a Paris 
park, he showed hirnself still a provincial, almost a rube. Talleyrand did not 
laugh, however, but he could not resist a practical joke on the man who 
was now his master in politics, although not in blood and nobility, since 
Talleyrand came from an old aristocratic family. To Napoleon's question, 
then, he simply replied, "Very few, mon general, but I dare say you will man­
age to find one." 
It was arranged that Napoleon would arrive at Talleyrand's house the 
following day at seven A.M. and would spend the moming there. The "boar 
hunt" would take place in the aftemoon. Throughout the moming the ex­
cited general talked nothing but boar hunting. Meanwhile, Talleyrand se­
cretly had his servants go to the market, buy two enormous black pigs, and 
take them to the great park. 
After lunch, the hunters and their hounds set off for the Bois de 
Boulogne . At a secret signal from Talleyrand, the servants loosed one of the 
pigs. "I see aboar," Napoleon cried joyfully, jumping onto his horse to give 
chase. Talleyrand stayed behind. It took half an hour of galloping through 
the park before the "boar" was finally captured. At the moment of triumph, 
however, Napoleon was approached by one of his aides, who knew the 
creature could not possibly be aboar, and feared the general would be 
ridiculed once the story got out: "Sir," he told Napoleon, "you realize of 
course that this is not a boar but a pig." 
Flying into a rage, Napoleon immediately set off at a gallop for Tal­
leyrand's house. He realized along the way that he would now be the butt 
of many a joke, and that exploding at Talleyrand would only make hirn 
LAW 24 189 
190 LAW 24 more ridiculous; it would be better to make a show of good humor. Still, he 
did not hide his displeasure weIl. 
Talleyrand decided to try to soothe the general's bruised ego. He told 
Napoleon not to go back to Paris yet-he should again go hunting in the 
park. There were many rabbits there, and hunting them had been a fa­
vorite pastime of Louis XVI. Talleyrand even offered to let Napoleon use a 
set of guns that had once belonged to Louis. With much flattery and cajol­
ery, he once again got Napoleon to agree to a hunt. 
The party left for the park in the late aftemoon. Along the way, 
Napoleon told Talleyrand, "I'm not Louis XVI, I surely won't kill even one 
rabbit." Yet that aftemoon, strangely enough, the park was teeming with 
rabbits. Napoleon killed at least fifty of them, and his mood changed from 
anger to satisfaction. At the end of his wild shooting spree, however, the 
same aide approach ed hirn and whispered in his ear, "To tell the truth, sir, I 
am beginning to believe these are not wild rabbits. I suspect that rascal Tal­
leyrand has played another joke on us." (The aide was right: Talleyrand 
had in fact sent his servants back to the market, where they had purchased 
dozens of rabbits and then had released them in the Bois de Boulogne.) 
Napoleon immediately mounted his horse and galloped away, this 
time retuming straight to Paris. He later threatened Talleyrand, wamed 
hirn not to tell a soul what had happened; if he became the laughingstock 
of Paris, there would be hell to pay. 
It took months for Napoleon to be able to trust Talleyrand again, and 
he never totally forgave hirn his humiliation. 
Interpretation 
Courtiers are like magicians: They deceptively play with appearances, 
only letting those around them see what they want them to see. With so 
much deception and manipulation afoot, it is essential to keep people from 
seeing your tricks and glimpsing your sleight of hand. 
Talleyrand was normally the Grand Wizard of Courtiership, and but 
for Napoleon's aide, he probably would have gotten away completely with 
both pleasing his master and having a joke at the general's expense. But 
courtiership is a subtle art, and overlooked traps and inadvertent mistakes 
can ruin your best tricks. Never risk being caught in your maneuvers; 
never let people see your devices. If that happens you instantly pass in peo­
ple's perceptions from a courtier of great manners to a loathsome rogue. It 
is a delicate game you play; apply the utrnost attention to covering your 
tracks, and never let your master unmask you.

192 LAW 25 OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW I 
Julius Caesar made his first significant mark on Roman society in 65 B.C., 
when he assumed the post of aedile, the official in charge of grain distribu­
tion and public games. He began his entrance into the public eye by orga­
nizing aseries of carefully crafted and well-timed spectacl es-wild-beast 
hunts, extravagant gladiator shows, theatrical contests . On several occa­
sions, he paid for these spectacl es out of his own pocket. To the common 
man, Julius Caesar became indelibly associated with these much-Ioved 
events. As he slowly rose to attain the position of consul, his popularity 
among the masses served as the foundation of his power. He had created 
an image of hirnself as a great public showman. 
In 49 B.C., Rome was on the brink of a civil war between rivalleaders, 
Caesar and Pompey. At the height of the tension, Caesar, an addict of the 
stage, attended a theatrical performance, and afterward, lost in thought, he 
wandered in the darkness back to his camp at the Rubicon, the river that 
divides ltaly from Gaul, where he had been campaigning. To march his 
army back into Italy across the Rubicon would mean the beginning of a 
war with Pompey. 
Before his staff Caesar argued both sides, forming the options like an 
actor on stage, aprecursor of Hamlet. Finally, to put his soliloquy to an 
end, he pointed to a seemingly innocent apparition at the edge of the 
river-a very tall soldier blasting a call on a trumpet, then going across a 
bridge over the Rubicon-and pronounced, "Let us accept this as a sign 
from the Gods and follow where they beckon, in vengeance on our double­
dealing enemie s. The die is cast." All of this he spoke portentously and dra­
matically, gesturing toward the river and looking his generals in the eye. 
He knew that these generals were uncertain in their support, but his ora­
tory overwhelmed them with a sense of the drama of the moment, and of 
the need to seize the time. A more prosaic speech would never have had 
the same effect. The generals rallied to his cause; Caesar and his army 
crossed the Rubicon and by the following year had vanqui shed Pompey, 
making Caesar dictator of Rome. 
In warfare, Caesar always played the leading man with gusto. He was 
as skilIed a horseman as any of his soldiers, and took pride in outdoing 
them in feats of bravery and endura nce. He entered battle astride the 
strongest mount, so that his soldiers would see hirn in the thick of battle, 
urging them on, always positioning hirnself in the center, a godlike symbol 
of power and a model for them to follow. Of all the armies in Rome, Cae­
sar's was the most devoted and loyal. His soldiers, like the common people 
who had attended his entertainments, had come to identify with hirn and 
with his cause. 
After the defeat of Pompey, the entertainments grew in scale. Nothing 
like them had ever been seen in Rome. The chariot races became more 
spectacular, the gladiator fights more dramatic, as Caesar staged fights to 
the death among the Roman nobility. He organiz ed enormous mock naval 
battles on an artificial lake. Plays were performed in every Roman ward. A 
giant new theater was built that sloped dramatically down the Tarpeian 
Rock. Crowds from all over the empire flocked to these events, the roads to 
Rome lined with visitors' tents. And in 45 B.C., timing his entry into the city 
for maximum effect and surprise, Caesar brought Cleopatra back to Rome 
after his Egyptian campaign, and staged even more extravagant public 
spectacles. 
These events were more than devices to divert the masses; they dra­
matically enhanc ed the public's sense of Caesar's character, and made hirn 
seem larger than life. Caesar was the master of his public image, of which 
he was forever aware. When he appeared before crowds he wore the most 
spectacular purple robes. He would be upstaged by no one. He was notori­
ously vain about his appearance-it was said that one reason he enjoyed 
being honored by the Senate and people was that on these occasions he 
could wear a laurel wreath, hiding his baldness. Caesar was a masterful or­
ator. He knew how to say a lot by saying a little, intuited the moment to 
end a speech for maximum effect. He never failed to incorporate a surprise 
into his public appearances-a startling announcement that would 
heighten their drama. 
Immensely popular among the Roman people, Caesar was hated and 
feared by his rivals. On the ides of March-March 15-in the year 44 B.C., 
a group of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius surrounded hirn in the 
senate and stabbed hirn to death. Even dying, however, he kept his sense of 
drama. Drawing the top of his gown over his face, he let go of the cloth's 
lower part so that it draped his legs, allowing hirn to die covered and de­
cent. According to the Roman historian Suetonius , his final words to his 
old friend Brutus, who was about to deliver a second blow, were in Greek, 
and as if rehearsed for the end of a play: "You too, my child?" 
Interpretation 
The Roman theater was an event for the masses, attended by crowds 
unimagina ble today. Packed into enormous auditoriums, the audience 
would be amused by raucous comedy or moved by high tragedy. Theater 
seemed to contain the essence of life, in its concentrated, dramatic form. 
Like a religious ritual, it had a powerful, instant appeal to the common 
man. 
Julius Caesar was perhaps the first public figure to understand the vital 
link between power and theater. This was because of his own obsessive in­
terest in drama. He sublimated this interest by making bimself an actor and 
director on the world stage. He said his lines as if they had been scripted ; 
he gestured and moved through a crowd with a constant sense of how he 
appeared to his audience. He incorporated surprise into his repertoire, 
building drama into bis speeches, staging into his public appeara nces. His 
gestures were broad enough for the common man to grasp them instantly. 
He became immensely popular .. 
Caesar set the ideal for all leaders and people of power. Like hirn, you 
must learn to enlarge YOUf actions through dramatic techniques such as 
LAW 25 198 
194 LAW 25 surprise, suspense, the creation of sympathy, and symbolic identification. 
Also like hirn, you must be constantly aware of your audience---of what 
will please them and what will bore them. You must arrange to place your­
self at the center, to command attention, and never to be upstaged at any 
cost. 
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II 
In the year 1831, a young woman named Aurore Dupin Dudevant left her 
husband and family in the provinces and moved to Paris. She wanted to be 
a writer; marriage, she feIt, was worse than prison, for it left her neither the 
time nor the freedom to pursue her passion. In Paris she would establish 
her independence and make her living by writing. 
Soon after Dudevant arrived in the capital, however, she had to con­
front certain harsh realities. To have any degree of freedom in Paris you 
had to have money. For a woman, money could only come through mar­
riage or prostitution. No woman had ever come close to making a living by 
writing. Women wrote as a hobby, supported by their husbands, or by an 
inheritance. In fact when Dudevant first showed her writing to an editor, 
he told her, "You should make babies, Madame, not literature." 
Clearly Dudevant had come to Paris to attempt the impossible. In the 
end, though, she came up with a strategy to do what no woman had ever 
done-a strategy to re-create herself completely, forging a public image of 
her own making. Women writers before her had been forced into a ready­
made role, that of the second-ra te artist who wrote mostly for other 
women. Dudevant decided that if she had to playa role, she would turn the 
game around: She would play the part of a man. 
In 1832 a publisher accepted Dudevant's first major novel, Indiana. 
She had chosen to publish it under a pseudonym, "George Sand," and all 
of Paris assumed this impressive new writer was male. Dudevant had 
sometimes worn men's clothes before creating "George Sand" (she had al­
ways found men's shirts and riding breeches more comforta ble); now, as 
a public figure, she exaggerated the image. She added long men's coats, 
gray hats, heavy boots, and dandyish cravats to her wardrobe. She smoked 
cigars and in conversation expressed herself like a man, unafraid to domi­
nate the conversation or to use a saucy word. 
This strange "malelfernale" writer fascinated the public. And unlike 
other women writers, Sand found herself accepted into the clique of male 
artists. She drank and smoked with them, even carried on affairs with the 
most famous artists of Europe---Musset, Liszt, Chopin. It was she who did 
the wooing, and also the abandoning-she moved on at her discretion. 
Those who knew Sand well understood that her male persona pro­
tected her from the public's prying eyes. Out in the world, she enjoyed 
playing the part to the extreme; in private she remained herself. She also 
realized that the character of "George Sand" could grow stale or pre­
dictable, and to avoid this she would every now and then dramatically alter 
the character she had create d; instead of conducting affairs with famous 
men, she would begin meddling in politics, Ieading demonstrat ions, inspir­
ing student rebellions. No one would dictate to her the limits of the charac­
ter she had created. Long after she died, and after most people had stopped 
reading her noveIs, the Iarger-than- life theatricality of that character has 
eontinued to fascinate and inspire. 
Interpretation 
Throughout Sand's public life, acquainta nces and other artists who spent 
time in her company had the feeling they were in the presence of a man. 
But in her journals and to her dosest friends, such as Gustave Flaubert, she 
eonfessed that she had no desire to be a man, but was playing a part for 
public consumption. What she really wanted was the power to determine 
her own character. She refused the limits her society would have set on her. 
She did not attain her power, however, by being herself; instead she cre­
ated a persona that she could constantly adapt to her own desires, a per­
sona that attracted attention and gave her presence. 
Understand this: The world wants to assign you a role in life. And 
onee you accept that role you are doomed. Your power is lirnited to the 
tiny amount allotted to the role you have selected or have been forced to 
assurne. An actor, on the other hand, plays many roles. Enjoy that protean 
power, and if it is beyond you, at least forge a new identity, one of YOUf 
own making, one that has had no boundaries assigned to it by an envious 
and resentful world. This act of defiance is Promet hean: It makes you re­
sponsible for your own creation. 
Your new identity will protect you from the world precisely because it 
is not "you"; it is a costume you put on and take off. You need not take it 
personally. And your new identity sets you apart, gives you theatrical pres­
ence. Those in the back rows can see you and hear you. Those in the front 
rows marvel at your audacity. 
Do not people talk in soc iety of a man being a great actor? They do not mean by 
that that he feets, but that he excels in simula ting, thou gh he feets noth ing. 
Denis Diderot, 1713-1 784 
KEYS TO POWER 
The character you seem to have been born with is not necessarily who you 
are; beyond the characteristics you have inherited, YOUf parents, your 
friends, and your peers have helped to shape your personality. The 
Promethean task of the powerful is to take control of the process, to stop al­
lowing others that ability to limit and mold them. Remake YOUfself into a 
eharacter of power. Working on yourself like day should be one of YOUf 
greatest and most pleasurable Iife tasks. It makes you in essence an artist­
an artist creating YOUfself. 
In fact, the idea of self-creation comes from the world of art. For thou-
LAW 25 195 
196 LAW 25 sands of years, only kings and the highest courtiers had the freedom to 
shape their public image and determine their own identity. Similarly, only 
kings and the wealthiest lords could contemplate their own image in art, 
and consciously alter it. The rest of mankind played the limited role that 
society demanded of them, and had little self-consciousne ss. 
A shift in this condition can be detected in Veläzquez's painting Las 
Meninas, made in 1656. The artist appears at the left of the canvas, standing 
before a painting that he is in the process of creating, but that has its back 
to us-we cannot see it. Beside hirn stands a princess, her attendants, and 
one of the court dwarves, all watching hirn work. The people posing for the 
painting are not directly visible, but we can see them in tiny reflections in a 
mirror on the back wall-the king and queen of Spain, who must be sitting 
somewhere in the foreground, outside the picture. 
The painting represents a dramatic change in the dynamics of power 
and the ability to determine one's own position in society. For Veläzquez, 
the artist, is far more prominently positioned than the king and queen. In a 
sense he is more powerful than they are, since he is clearly the one control­
ling the image-their image. Veläzquez no longer saw hirnself as the slav­
ish, dependent artist. He had remade hirnself into a man of power. And 
indeed the first people other than aristocrats to play openly with their 
image in Western society were artists and writers, and later on dandies and 
bohemians. Today the concept of self-creation has slowly filtered down to 
the rest of society, and has become an ideal to aspire to. Like Veläzquez, 
you must demand for yourself the power to determine your position in the 
painting, and to create your own image. 
The first step in the process of self-creation is self-consciousness­
being aware of yourself as an actor and taking control of your appearance 
and emotions. As Diderot said, the bad actor is the one who is always sin­
cere. People who wear their hearts on their sleeves out in society are tire­
some and embarrassing. Their sincerity notwithstanding, it is hard to take 
them seriously. Those who cry in public may temporarily elicit sympathy, 
but sympathy so on turns to scorn and irritation at their self­
obsessiveness-they are crying to get attention, we feel, and a malicious 
part of us wants to deny them the satisfaction. 
Good actors control themselves better. They can play sincere and 
heartfelt, can affect a tear and a compassionate look at will, but they don't 
have to feel it. They externalize emotion in a form that others can und er­
stand. Method acting is fatal in the real world. No mler or leader could 
possibly play the part if all of the emotions he showed had to be real. So 
leam self-control . Adopt the plasticity of the actor, who can mold his or her 
face to the emotion required. 
The second step in the process of self-creation is a variation on the 
George Sand strategy: the creation of a memorable character, one that 
compels attention, that stands out above the other players on the stage. 
This was the game Abraham Lincoln played. The homespun, common 
country man, he knew, was a kind of president that America had never had 
but would delight in electing. Although many of these qualit ies came natu­
rally to hirn, he played them up-the hat and clothes, the beard. (No presi­
dent before hirn had worn a beard.) Lincoln was also the first president to 
use photogra phs to spread his image, helping to create the icon of the 
"homespun president." 
Good drama, however, needs more than an interesting appeara nce, or 
a singl e stand-out moment. Drama takes place over time--it is an unfold­
ing event. Rhythm and timing are critical. One of the most important ele­
ments in the rhythm of drama is suspense. Houdini for instance, could 
sometimes complete his escape acts in secon ds-but he drew them out to 
minute s, to make the aud ience sweat. 
The key to keeping the audienc e on the edge of their seats is letting 
events unfold slowly, then speeding them up at the right moment, accord­
ing to a pattern and tempo that you control. Great mlers from Nap oleon to 
Mao Tse-tung have used theatrical timing to surprise and divert their pub­
Iic. Franklin Delano Roosevelt understood the importa nce of staging politi­
cal events in a particular order and rhythm. 
At the time of his 1932 president ial election, the United States was in 
the midst of a dire economic crisis. Banks were failing at an alarming rate. 
Shortly after winning the election, Roosevelt went into a kind of retreat. 
He said nothing about his plans or his cabinet appointm ents. He even re­
fused to meet the sitting president, Herbert Hoover, to discuss the transi­
tion. By the time of Roosevelt's inauguration the country was in astate of 
high anxiety. 
In his inaugural add ress, Roosevelt shifted gea rs. He made a powernd 
speech, making it clear that he intended to lead the country in a completely 
new direct ion, sweeping away the timid ge stures of his predecessors. From 
then on the pace of his speeches and public decision s-cabinet appoint­
ments, bold legislation-unf olded at an incredibly rapid rate . The period 
after the inauguration became known as the "Hundred Days," and its suc­
cess in altering the country's mood partly stemmed from Roosevelt's clever 
pacing and use of dramatic contrast. He held his audience in suspense, 
then hit them with a series of bold ge stures that seemed all the more mo­
mentous because they came from nowhere. You must leam to orchestrate 
events in a similar manner, never revealing all your cards at once, but un­
folding them in a way that height ens their dramatic effe ct. 
Besides covering a multitude of sins, good drama can also confuse and 
deceive your enemy. During Wo rld War II, the German playwright Bertolt 
Brecht worked in Hollywood as a scree nwriter. After the war he was called 
before the House Committee on Un-American Activit ies for his supp osed 
Communist sympat hies. Other writers who had been called to testify 
planned to humiliate the committee members with an angry emotional 
stand. Brecht was wiser: He would play the committee like a violin, charm­
ing them while fooling them as weIl. He carefully rehearsed his responses, 
and brought along some props, notably a cigar on which he puffed away, 
knowing the head of the committee liked ciga rs. And indeed he proceeded 
LAW 25 197 
198 LAW 25 to beguile the committee with well-crafted responses that were ambiguous, 
funny, and double-edged. Instead of an angry, heartfelt tirade, he ran cir­
cles around them with a staged production, and they let hirn off scot-free. 
Other dramatic effects for your repertoire include the beau geste, an 
action at a climactic moment that symbolizes your triumph or your bold­
ness. Caesar's dramatic crossing of the Rubicon was a beau geste--a move 
that dazzled the soldiers and gave hirn heroic proporti ons. You must also 
appreciate the importance of stage entranc es and exits. When Cleopa tra 
first met Caesar in Egypt, she arrived rolled up in a carpet, which she 
arranged to have unfurled at his feet. George Washington twice left power 
with flourish and fanfare (first as a general, then as a president who refused 
to sit for a third term), showing he knew how to make the moment count, 
dramatically and symbolica lly. Your own entrances and exits should be 
crafted and planned as carefully. 
Rememb er that overacting can be counterproductiv e--it is another 
way of spending too much effort trying to attract attention. The actor 
Richard Burton discovered early in his career that by standing totally still 
onstage, he drew attention to hirnself and away from the other actors. It is 
less what you do that matters, clearly, than how you do it-your graceful­
ness and imposing stillness on the sodal stage count for more than overdo­
ing your part and moving around too much. 
Finally: Learn to play many roles, to be whatever the moment re­
quires. Adapt your mask to the situation-be protean in the faces you wear. 
Bismarck played this game to perfection: To a liberal he was a liberal, to a 
hawk he was a hawk. He could not be grasped, and what cannot be 
grasped cannot be consumed. 
1 mag e 
The Creek Sea-God Proteus. 
His power came from his ability tb 
change shape at will, to be whatever the 
moment required. When Menelaus, brother 
of Agamemnon, tried to seize hirn, Proteus 
transformed hirnself into a lion, then a serpent, a 
panther, aboar, running water, and finally a leafy tree. 
Authority: Know how to be all things to all men. A discreet Proteus-a 
scholar among scholars, a saint among saints. That is the art of winning over 
everyone, far like attracts like. Take note of temperaments and adapt your­
self to that of each person you meet-follow the lead of the serious and 
jovial in turn, changing your mood discreetly. (Baltasar Craciän, 1601-1658) 
REVERSAL 
There can really be no reversal to this criticallaw: Bad theater is bad the­
ater. Even appearing natural requires art-in other words, acting. Bad act­
ing only creates embarrassment. Of course you should not be too 
dramatic-avoid the histrionic gest ure. But that is simply bad theater any­
way, since it violates centuries-old dramatic laws against overacting. In 
essence there is no revers al to this law.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I 
Near the end of the second century A.D., as China's mighty Han Empire 
slowly collapsed, the great general and imperial minister Ts'ao Ts'ao 
emerged as the most powernd man in the country. Seeking to extend his 
power base and to rid hirnself of the last of his rivals, Ts'ao Ts'ao began a 
campaign to take control of the strategically vital Central Plain. During the 
siege of a key city, he slightly miscalculated the timing for supplies of grain 
to arrive from the capital. As he waited for the shipment to come in, the 
army ran low on food, and Ts'ao Ts'ao was forced to order the chief of 
commissariat to reduce its rations. 
Ts'ao Ts'ao kept a tight rein on the army, and ran a network of inform­
ers. His spies soon reported that the men were complaining, grumbling 
timt he was living weIl while they themselves had barely enough to eat. 
Perhaps Ts'ao Ts'ao was keeping the food for hirnself, they murmured. If 
the grumbling spread, Ts'ao Ts'ao could have a mutiny on his hands. He 
summoned the chief of commissa riat to his tent. 
"I want to ask you to lend me something, and you must not refuse," 
Ts'ao Ts'ao told the chief. "What is it?" the chief replied. "I want the loan of 
your head to show to the troops," said Ts'ao Ts'ao. "But I've done nothing 
wrong!" cried the chief. "I know," said Ts'ao Ts'ao with a sigh, ;'but if I do 
not put you to death, there will be a mutiny. Do not grieve-after you're 
gone, I'Il look after your farnily." Put this way, the request left the chief no 
choice, so he resigned hirnself to his fate and was beheaded that very day. 
Seeing his head on public display, the soldiers stopped grumbling. Some 
saw through Ts'ao Ts'ao's ge sture, but kept quiet, stunned and intimidated 
by his violence. And most accepted his version of who was to bIarne, pre­
ferring to believe in his wisdom and fairness than in his incompetence and 
cruelty. 
Interpretation 
Ts'ao Ts'ao carne to power in an extremely tumultuous time. In the struggle 
for supremacy in the crumbling Han Empire, enemies had emerged from 
all sides. The battle for the Central Plain had proven more difficult than he 
imagined, and money and provisions were a constant concern. No wonder 
that under such stress, he had forgotten to order supplies in time. 
Once it became clear that the delay was a critical mistake, and that the 
army was seething with mutiny, Ts'ao Ts'ao had two options: apology and 
excuses, or a scapegoat. Understanding the workings of power and the im-CI/EL\l n'STlCE

OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW II 
For several years Cesare Borgia campaign ed to gain control of large parts 
of Italy in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. In the year 1500 he 
managed to take Romagna, in northem Italy. The region had for years 
been ruled by aseries of greedy masters who had plundered its wealth for 
themselve s. Without police or any disciplining force, it had descended into 
lawlessness, whole areas being ruled by robbers and feuding families. 
To establish order, Cesare appointed a lieutenant general of the region­
Remirro qe Orco, "a cruel and vigorous man," according to Niccolö 
Machiav elli. Cesare gave de Orco absolute powers. 
With energy and violence, de Orco established a severe, brutal justice 
in Romagna, and so on rid it of almost all of its lawless elemen ts. But in his 
zeal he sometimes went too far, and after a couple of years the local popu­
lation resented and even hated hirn. In December of 1502, Cesare took de­
cisive action. He first let it be known that he had not approved of de Orco's 
cruel and violent deeds, which stemmed from the lieutenant' s brutal na­
ture. Then, on December 22, he imprisoned de Orco in the town of Ce­
sena, and the day after Christmas the townspeople awoke to find a strange 
spectade in the middle ofthe piazza: de Orco's headless body, dressed in a 
lavish suit with a purple cape, the head impaled beside it on a pike, the 
bloody knife and executio ner's block laid out beside the head. As Machi­
avelli conclude d his comments on the affair, "The ferocity of this scene left 
the people at once stunned and satisfied." 
Interpretation 
Cesare Borgia was a master player in the game of power. Always planning 
several moves ahead, he set his opponents the cleverest traps. For this 
Machiavelli honored rum above all others in The Prince. 
Cesare foresaw the future with amazing clarity in Romagna: Only bru­
tal justice would bring order to the region. The process would take several 
years, and at first the people would welcome it. But it would soon make 
many enemies, and the citizens would come to resent the imposition of 
such unforgiving justice, especially by outsiders. Cesare hirnself, then, 
could not be seen as the agent of this justice-the people's hatred would 
cause too many problems in the future . And so he chose the one man who 
could do the dirty work, knowing in advance that once the task was done 
he would have to display de Orco's head on a pike. The scapegoat in this 
case had been planned fr om the beginning. 
With Ts'ao Ts'ao, the scapegoat was an entirely innocent man; in the 
Romagna, he was the offensive weapon in Cesare's arsenal that let hirn get 
the dirty work done without bloodying his own hands. With this second 
kind of scapegoat it is wise to separate yourself from the hatchet man at 
some point, either leaving hirn dangling in the wind or, like Cesare, even 
making yourself the one to bring hirn to justice. Not only are you free of in­
volvement in the problem, you can appear as the one who cleaned it up. 
The Athenians regularly maintained a number of degraded and useless 
beings at the public expense; and when any calamit y, such as plague, 
drough t, or famine, befeil the cit y ... [these scapego atsl were led about ... 
and then sacrificed, apparently by being stoned outside the city. 
The Colden Bough , Sir!ames George Frazer, 1854-1 941 
KEYS TO POWER 
The use of scapegoats is as old as civilization itself, and examples of it can 
be found in cultures around the world. The main idea behind these sacri­
fices is the shifting of guilt and sin to an outside figure-ob ject, animal, or 
man-which is then banished or destroyed. The Hebrews used to take a 
live goat (hence the term "scapegoat") upon whose head the priest would 
lay both hands while confessing the sins of the Children of Israel. Having 
thus had those sins transferred to it, the be ast would be led away and aban­
doned in the wildemess. With the Athenians and the Aztecs, the scapegoat 
was human, often a person fed and raised for the purpose. Since famine 
and plague were thought to be visited on humans by the gods, in punish­
ment for wrongdoing, the people suffered not only from the famine and 
plague themselves but from blame and guilt. They freed themselves of guilt 
by transferring it to an innocent person, whose death was intended to sat­
isfy the divine powers and banish the evil from their midst. 
It is an extremely human response to not look inward after amistake 
or crime, but rather to look outward and to affix blame and guilt on a con­
venient object. When the plague was ravaging Thebes, Oedipus looked 
everywhere for its cause, everywhere except inside hirnself and his own sin 
of incest, which had so offended the gods and occasioned the plague. This 
profound need to exteriorize one's guilt, to project it on another person or 
object, has an immense power, which the clever know how to hamess. Sac-
LAW 26 203 
204 LAW 26 rifice is a ritual, perhaps the most ancient ritual of all; ritual too is a well­
spring of power. In the killing of de Orco, note Cesare's symbolic and ritu­
alistic display of his body. By framing it in this dramatic way he focused 
guilt outward. The citizens of Romagna responded instantly. Because it 
comes so naturally to us to look outward rather than inward, we readily ac­
cept the scapegoat' s guilt. 
The bloody sacrifice of the scapegoat seems a barbaric relic of the 
past, but the practice lives on to this day, if indirectly and symbolically; 
since power depends on appearan ces, and those in power must seem never 
to make mistake s, the use of scapegoats is as popular as ever. What modem 
leader will take respons ibility for his blunders? He searches out others 
to blame, a scapegoat to sacrifice. When Mao Tse-tung' s Cultural Rev­
olution failed miserably, he made no apologies or excuses to the Chinese 
people; instead, like Ts'ao Ts'ao before hirn, he offered up scapegoats, in­
du ding his own personal secretary and high-ranking memher of the Party, 
eh' en Po-ta. 
Franklin D. Roosevelt had a reputation for honesty and fairness. 
Throughout his career, however, he faced many situations in which being 
the nice guy would have spelled political disaster-yet he could not be 
seen as the agent of any foul play. For twenty years, then, his secretary, 
Louis Howe, played the role de Orco had. He handle d the backro om deals, 
the manipulation of the press, the underhanded campaign maneu vers. And 
whenever amistake was committe d, or a dirty trick contradicting Roo­
sevelt's carefully crafted image became public, Howe served as the scape­
goat, and never complained. 
Besides conveniently shifting biarne, a scapegoat can serve as a wam­
ing to others. In 1631 a plot was hatched to oust France's Cardinal Riche­
lieu from power, a plot that became known as "The Day of the Dupes." It 
almost succeeded, since it involved the upper echelons of govemment, in­
duding the queen mother. But through luck and his own connivances, 
Richelieu survived. 
One of the key conspirators was a man named Marillac, the keeper of 
the seals. Richelieu could not imprison him without implicating the queen 
mother, an extremely dangerous tactic, so he targeted Marillac's brother, a 
marshai in the army. This man had no involvement in the plot. Richelieu, 
however, afraid that other conspiracies might be in the air, especially in the 
army, decided to set an example. He tried the brother on trumped-up 
charges and had hirn executed. In this way he indirectly punished the real 
perpetrator, who had thought hirnself protected, and warned any future 
conspirators that he would not shrink from sacrificing the innocent to pro-
tect his own power. , 
In fact it is often wise to choose the most i rbocent victim possible as a 
sacrificial goat. Such people will not be powerful enough to fight you, and 
their naive protests may be seen as protesting too much-may be seen, in 
other words, as a sign of their guilt. Be careful, however, not to create a 
martyr. It is important that you remain the victim, the poor leader betrayed 
by the incompetence of those around you. If the scapegoat appears too 
weak and his punishment too cruel, you may end up the victim of your 
own device. Sometimes you should find a more powerful scapegoat-one 
who will elicit less sympathy in the long run. 
In this vein, history has time and again shown the value of using a 
elose associate as a scapegoat. This is known as the "fall of the favorite." 
Most kings had a personal favorite at court, a man whom they singled out, 
sometimes for no apparent reason, and lavished with favors and attention. 
But this court favorite could serve as a convenient scapegoat in case of a 
threat to the king's reputation. The public would readily believe in the 
scapegoat's guilt-why would the king sacrifice his favorite unless he were 
guilty? And the other courtiers, resentful of the favorite anyway, would re­
joice at his downfall. The king, meanwhi le, would rid hirnself of a man who 
by that time had probably learned too much about hirn, perhaps becoming 
arrogant and even disdainful of hirn. Choosing a elose associate as a scape­
goat has the same value as the "fall of the favorite." You may lose a friend 
or aide, but in the long-term sc heme of things, it is more important to hide 
your mistakes than to hold on to someone who one day will probably turn 
against you. Besides, you can always find a new favorite to take hi� place. 
Image: The Innocent Goat. On 
the Day of Atonement, the high 
priest brings the goat into the 
temple, places his hands on its 
head, and confesses the peo­
ple's sins, transferring guilt to 
the guiltless beast, which is 
then led to the wildemess and 
abandoned, the people's sins 
and blame vanishing with hirn. 
Authority: Folly consists not in committing Folly, but in being 
incapable of concealing it. All men make mistakes, but the wise 
conceal the blunders they have made, while fools make them pub­
lic. Reputation depends more on what is hidden than on what is 
seen. If you can't be good, be careful. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658)

OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW I 
In 59 B.C., the future queen Cleopa tra of Egypt, then ten years old, wit­
nessed the overthrow and banishment of her father, Ptolemy XII, at the 
hand of his eIder daughters-her own sisters. One of the daughters, 
Berenice, emerged as the leader of the rebellion, and to ensure that she 
would now rule Egypt alone, she imprisoned her other sisters and mur­
dered her own husband. This may have been necessary as a practical step 
to secure her rule. But that a member of the royal family, a queen no less, 
would so overtly exact such violence on her own family horrified her sub­
jects and stirred up powerful opposit ion. Four years later this oppo sition 
was able to return Ptolemy to power, and he promptly had Berenice and 
the other eIder sisters beheaded. 
In 51 B.C. Ptolemy died, leaving four remaining children as heirs. As 
was the tradition in Egypt, the eldest son, Ptolemy XIII (only ten at the 
time) , married the eIder sister, Cleopatra (now eighteen), and the couple 
took the throne together as king and queen. None of the four children feIt 
satisfied with this; everyone, including Cleopatra, wanted more power. A 
struggle emerged between Cleopa tra and Ptolemy, each trying to push the 
other to the side. 
In 48 B.C., with the help of a government faction that feared Cleopa­
tra's ambiti ons, Ptolemy was able to force his sister to flee the country, 
leaving hirnself as sole ruler. In exile, Cleopa tra scheme d. She wanted to 
rule alone and to restore Egypt to its past glory, a goal she feIt none of her 
other siblings could achieve ; yet as long as they were alive, she could not 
realizeher dream. And the example of Berenice had made it clear that no 
one would serve a queen who was seen murdering her own kind. Even 
Ptolemy XIII had not dared murder Cleopa tra, although he knew she 
would plot against hirn from abroad. 
Within a year after Cleopatra's banishment, the Roman dictator Julius 
Caesar arrived in Egypt, determined to make the country a Roman colony, 
Cleopa tra saw her chance: Reentering Egypt in disguise, she traveled hun­
dreds of miles to reach Caesar in Alexandria. Legend has it that she had 
herself smuggled into his presence rolled up inside a carpet, which was 
gracefully unfurled at his feet, revealing the young queen. Cleopatra imme­
diately went to work on the Roman. She appealed to his love of spectacle 
and his interest in Egyptian history, and poured on her feminine charms . 
Caesar so on succumbed and restored Cleopa tra to the throne. 
Cleopatra's siblings seethed-she had outmaneuvered them. Ptolemy 
XIII would not wait to see what happened next: From his palace in 
Alexandria, he summoned a great army to march on the city and attack 
Caesar. In response, Caesar immediately put Ptolemy and the rest of the 
family under house arrest. But Cleopatra's younger sister Arsinoe escaped 
from the palace and placed herself at the head of the approaching Egyptian 
troops, proclaiming herself queen of Egypt. Now Cleopatra finally saw her 
chance: She convinced Caesar to release Ptolemy from house arrest, under 
the agreement that he would broker a truce. Of course she knew he would 
do the opposite-that he would fight Arsinoe for control of the Egyptian 
army. But this was to Cleopatra's benefit, for it would divide the royal fam­
ily. Better still, it would give Caesar the chance to defeat and kill her sib­
lings in battle. 
Reinforced by troops from Rome, Caesar swiftly defeated the rebels. 
In the Egyptian s' retreat, Ptolemy drowned in the Nile. Caesar captured 
Arsinoe and had her sent to Rome as a prisoner. He also executed the nu­
merous enemies who had conspired against Cleopatra, and imprisoned 
others who had opposed her. To reinforce her position as uncontested 
queen, Cleopatra now married the only sibling left, Ptolemy XIV -only 
eleven at the time, and the weakest of the lot. Four years later Ptolemy 
mysteriously died, of poison. 
In 41 B.C., Cleopatra employed on a second Roman leader, Marc 
Antony, the same tactics she had used so weIl on Julius Caesar. After se­
ducing hirn, she hin ted to hirn that her sister Arsinoe, still a prisoner in 
Rome, had conspired to destroy hirn. Marc Antony believed her and 
promptly had Arsi noe execute d, thereby getting rid of the last of the sib­
lings who had posed such a threat to Cleopatra. 
Interpretation 
Legend has it that Cleopatra succeeded through her seductive charms, but 
in reality her power came from an ability to get people to do her bidding 
without realizing they were being manipula ted. Caesar and Antony not 
only rid her of her most dangerous siblings-Pto lemy XIII and Arsinoe­
they decimated alt of her enemies, in both the govemment and the mili­
tary. The two men became her cat's-paws. They entered the fire for her, 
did the ugly b� necessary work, while shielding her from appearing as the 
destroyer of her\iblings and fellow Egyptians. And in the end, both men 
acquiesced to herdesire to rule Egypt not as a Roman colony but as an in­
dependent allied kingdom. And they did all this for her without realizing 
how she had manipulated them. This was persuasion of the subtlest and 
most powerful kind. and crammed it in his 
jaw. 
Now came the shining

And affin haste the 
two marauders 
scampered.

the plunder had the

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 11 
In the late 1920s, civil war broke out in China as the Nationalist and Com­
munist parties battled for control of the country. In 1927 Chiang Kai-shek, 
the Nationalist leader, vowed to kill every last Communist, and over the 
next few years he nearly accomplished his task, pushing his enemies hard 
until, in 1934-1935, he forced them into the Long March, a six-thousand­
mile retreat from the southeast to the remote northwest, through harsh ter­
rain, in which most of their ranks were decimate d. In late 1936 Chiang 
planned one last offensive to wipe them out, but he was caught in a mutiny: 
His own soldiers captured hirn and turned hirn over to the Communists. 
Now he could only expect the worst 
Meanwhil e, however, the Japanese began an invasion of China, and 
much to Chiang's surprise, instead of killing hirn the Communist leader, 
Mao Tse-tung, proposed adeal: The Communists would let hirn go, and 
would recognize hirn as commander of their forces as weIl as his, if he 
would agree to fight alongside them against their common enemy. Chiang 
had expected torture and execution; now he could not believe his luck. 
How soft these Reds had become. Without having to fight a rearguard ac­
tion against the Communists, he knew he could beat the Japanese, and 
then a few years down the line he would turn around and destroy the Reds 
with ease. He had nothing to lose and everything to gain by agreeing to 
their terms. 
The Communists proceeded to fight the J apanese in their usual fash­
ion, with hit-and-run guerrilla tact ics, while the Nationalists f<>ught a more 
conventional war, Together, after several years, they succeeded in evicting 
the Japanese. Now, however, Chiang finally understood what Mao had re­
ally planned. His own army had met the brunt of the Japanese artillery, 
was greatly weakened, and would take a few years to recover. The Com­
munists, meanwhile, had not only avoided any direct hits from the Japa­
nese, they had used the time to recoup their strength, and to spread out 
and gain pockets of influence all over China. As so on as the war against the 
Japanese ended, the civil war started again-but this time the Communists 
enveloped the weakened Nationalists and slowly beat them into submis­
sion. The Japanese had served as Mao's cat's-paw, inadvertently ploughing 
the fields for the Communists and making possible their victory over Chi­
ang Kai-shek. 
Interpretation 
Most leaders who had taken as powerful an enemy as Chiang Kai-shek 
prisoner would have made sure to kill hirn. But in doing so they would 
have lost the chance Mao exploited. Without the experienced Chiang as 
leader of the Nationalists, the fight to drive the Japanese out might have 
lasted much longer, with devastating results. Mao was far too clever to let 
anger spoil the chance to kill two birds with one stone. In essence, Mao 
used two cat's-paws to help hirn attain total victo ry. First, he cleverly baited 
Chiang into taking charge of the war against the Japanese. Mao knew the 
Nationalists led by Chiang would do most of the hard fighting and would 
succeed in pushing the Japanese out of China, if they did not have to con­
cern themselves with fighting the Communists at the same time. The Na­
tionalists, then, were the first cat's-paw, used to evict the Japanese. But 
Mao also knew that in the process of leading the war against the invaders, 
the Japanese artillery and air support would decimate the conventional 
forces of the Nationalists, doing damage it could take the Communists 
decades to inflict. Why waste time and lives if the J apanese could do the 
job quickly? It was this wise policy of using one cat's-paw after another that 
allowed the Communists to prevail. 
There are two uses of the cat's-paw: to save appeara nces, as Cleopatra 
did, and to save energy and effort. The latter case in particular demands 
that you plan several moves in advance, realizing that a temporary move 
backward (letting Chiang go, say) can lead to a giant leap forward. If you 
are temporarily weakened and need time to recover, it will often serve you 
weIl to use those around you both as a screen to hide your intentions and 
as a cat's-paw to do your work for you. Look for a powerful third party who 
shares an enemy with you (if for different reasons) , then take advantage of 
their superior power to deal blows which would have cost you much more 
energy, since you are weaker. You can even gently guide them into ho stili­
ties. Always search out the overly aggressive as potential cat's-pa ws-th ey 
are often more than willing to get into a fight, and you can choose just the 
right fight for your purposes.

When he got home, the 
hirt! asked him whether

"No," said Ihe 
merchant , "1 fear thaI 
my news is had. One of 
210 LAW 26 relative who had fallen into debt. But although Soemon had managed to 
bail out his relative, he had simply displaced the burden onto hirnself. 
Daizen knew Soemon well-he neither cared nor understood much ab out 
money, and could easily get into trouble through slowness in repaying the 
loan, which had been made by a wealthy merchant called Kawachiya 
Sanemon. Yet if Daizen offered to help Soemon pay back the loan, he 
would refuse, out of pride, and might even be offended. 
One day Daizen visited his friend, and after touring the garden and 
looking at Soemon's prized peonies, they retired to his reception room. 
Here Daizen saw a painting by the master Kano Tennyu. ''Ah,'' Daizen ex­
claimed, "a splendid piece of painting .... I don't know when I have seen 
anything I like better." Mter several more bouts of praise, Soemon had no 
choice: "Well," he said, "since you like it so much, I hope you will do me 
the favor of accepting it." 
At first Daizen refused, but when Soemon insisted he gave in. The 
next day Soemon in turn received a package from Daizen. Inside it was a 
beautiful and delicate vase, which Daizen, in an accompanying note, asked 
his friend to accept as a token of his appreciation for the painting that Soe­
mon had so graciously given hirn the day before. He explained that the 
vase had been made by Sen no Rikyu hirnself, and bore an inscription 
from Emperor Hideyoshi. If Soemon did not care for the vase, Daizen sug­
gested, he might make a gift of it to an adherent of Cha-no -yu-p erhaps 
the merchant Kawachiya Sanemon, who had often expressed adesire to 
possess it. "I hear," Daizen continued, "he has a fine piece of fancy paper 
[the 300-ryo 1.0.U.] which you would much like. It is possible you might 
arrange an exchange ." 
Realizing what his gracious friend was up to, Soemon took the vase to 
the wealthy lender. "However did you get this," exclaimed Sanemon, 
when Soemon showed hirn the vase. "I have often heard of it, but this is the 
first time I have ever seen it. It is such a treasure that it is never allowed 
outside the gate!" He instantly offered to exchange the debt note for the 
flower vase, and to give Soemon 300 ryo more on top of it. But Soemon, 
who did not care for money, only wanted the debt note back, and 
Sanemon gladly gave it to hirn. Then Soemon immediately hurried to 
Daizen's house to thank hirn for his clever support. 
Interpretation 
Kuriyama Daizen understo od that the granting of a favor is never simple: 
If it is done with' fuss and obviousness, its receiver feels burdened by an 
obligati on. This may give the doer a certain power, but it is apower that 
will eventually self-destruct, for it will stir up resentrnent and resistance . A 
favor done indirectly and elegantly has ten times more power. Daizen 
knew a direct approach would only have offended Soemon. By letting his 
friend give hirn the painting, however, he made Soemon feel that he too 
had pleased his friend with a gift. In the end, all three parties emerged from 
the encounter feeling fulfilled in their own way. 
In essence, Daizen made hirnself the cat's-paw, the tool to take the 
ehestnuts out of the fire. He must have feIt some pain in losing the vase, but 
he gained not only the painting but, more important, the power of the 
eourtier. The courtier uses his gloved hand to soften any blows against hirn, 
disguise his scars, and make the act of rescue more elegant and clean. By 
helping others, the courtier eventually helps hirnself. Daizen's example 
provides the paradigm for every favor done between friends and peers: 
never impose your favors. Search out ways to make yourself the cat's-paw, 
indirectly extricating your friends from distress without imposing yourself 
or making them feel obligated to you.

KEYS TO POWER 
As aleader you may imagine that constant diligence, and the appearance 
of working harder than anyone else, signify power. Actually, though, they 
have the opposite effect: They imply weakness. Why are you working so 
hard? Perhaps you are incompetent, and have to put in extra effort just to 
keep up; perhaps you are one of those people who does not know how to 
delegate, and has to meddle in everything. The truly powernd, on the other 
hand, seem never to be in a hurry or overburdened. While others work 
their fingers to the bone, they take their leisure. They know how to find the 
right people to put in the effort while they save their energy and keep their 
hands out of the fire. Similarly, you may believe that by taking on the dirty 
work yourself, involving yourself directly in unpleasant actions, you im­
pose your power and instill fear. In fact you make yourself look ugly, and 
abusive of your high position. Truly powernd people keep their hands 
clean. Only good things surround them, and the only announcements they 
make are of glorious achievements . 
You will often find it necessa ry, of course, to expend energy, or to ef­
feet an evil but necessa ry action. But you must never appear to be this ac­
tion's agent. Find a cat's-pa w. Develop the arts of finding, using, and, in 
time, getting rid of these people when their cat's-paw role has been ful­
filled.

After several hours, the men hiding on board sailed the vessels quickly 
downstream, where Chuko Liang met them and collecte d his 100,000

Chuko Liang would never do work that others could do for hirn-h e 
was always thinking up tricks like this one. The key to planning such a 
strategy is the ability to think far ahead, to imagine ways in which other 
people can be baited into doing the job for you. 
An essential element in making this strategy work is to disguise your 
goal, shrouding it in mystery, like the strange enemy boats appearing 
dimly in the mist. When your rivals cannot be sure what you are after, they 
will react in ways that often work against them in the long ron. In fact they 
will become your cat's-paws. If you disguise your intenti ons, it is much eas­
ier to guide them into moves that accomplish exactly what you want done, 
but prefer not to do yourself. This may require planning several moves in 
advance, like a billiard ball that bounces off the sides a few times before 
heading into the right pocket. 
The early-twentieth-century American con artist Yellow Kid Weil 
knew that no matter how skillfully he homed in on the perfect wealthy 
sucker, if he, a stranger, approac hed this man directly, the sucker might be­
come suspicious. So Weil would find someone the sucker already knew to 
serve as a cat's-pa w-s omeone lower on the totem pole who was himself 
an unlikely target, and would therefore be less suspicious. Weil would in­
terest this man in a scheme promising incredible wealth . Conv inced the 
scheme was for real, the cat's-paw would often suggest, without prompting, 
that his boss or wealthy friend should get invol ved: Having more cash to 
invest, this man would increase the size of the pot, making bigger bucks for 
an concemed. The cat's-paw would then involve the wealthy sucker who 
had been Weil's target an along, but who would not suspect a trap, since it 
was his trosty subordinate who had roped him in. Dev ices like this are 
often the best way to approach a person of power: Use an associate or sub­
ordinate to hook you up with your primary target. The cat's-paw estab­
lishes your cred ibility and shields you from the unsavory appearance of 
being too pushy in your courtship. 
The easiest and most effe ctive way to use a cat's-paw is often to plant 
information with him that he will then spread to your primary target. False 
or plan ted inform ation is a power ful tool, especia lly if spread by a dupe 
whom no one suspects. You will find it very easy to play innocent and dis­
guise yourself as the source. 
The strategic therapist Dr. Milton H. Erick son would often encounter 
among his patients a marrie d couple in which the wife wante d the therapy 
but the husband absolutely refused it. Rather than wasting energy trying to 
deal with the man directly, Dr. Erickson would see the wife alone, and as 
she talke d he would interj ect interpretations of the husb and's behavior that 
he knew would rile the husband up if he heard them. Sure enough, the wife 
would tell her husband what the doctor had said. After a few weeks the 
husband would be so furious he would insist on joining his wife in the ses­
sions so he could set the doctor straight. 
Finally, you may well find cases in which deliberately offering yourself 
as the cat's-paw will ultimately gain you great power. This is the ruse of the 
perfect courtier. Its symbol is Sir Walter Raleigh, who once placed his own 
cloak on the muddy ground so that Queen Elizabeth would not sully her 
shoes. As the instrument that protects a master or peer from unpleasant­
ness or danger, you gain immense respect, which sooner or later will pay 
dividends. And remember: If you can make your assistance subtle and gra­
cious rather than boastful and burdensome, your recompense will be that 
much the more satisfying and powerful. 
Image: The Cat's-P aw. 
It has long claws to grab 
things . It is soft and 
padded. Take hold of the cat 
and use its paw to pluck 
things out of the fire, to claw 
your enemy, to play with the 
mouse before devouring it. 
Sometimes you hurt the 
cat, but most often it 
doesn't feel a thing. 
Authority : Do everything pie asant yourself, everything unpleas­
ant through third parties. By adopting the first course you win 
favor, by taking the second you deflect ill will. Important affairs

214 LAW 26 REVERSAL 
The cat's-paw and the scapegoat must be used with extreme caution and 
delicacy. They are like screens that hide your own involvement in dirty 
work from the public; if at any moment the screen is lifted and you are 
seen as the manipulator, the puppet master, the whole dynamic turns 
around-your hand will be seen everywhere, and you will be blamed for 
misfort unes you may have had nothing to do with. Once the truth is re­
vealed, events will snowball beyond your control. 
In 1572, Queen Catherine de' Medicis of France conspired to do away 
with Gaspard de Coligny, an admiral in the French navy and a leading 
member of the Huguenot (French Protestant) community. Coligny was 
elose to Catheri ne's son, Charles IX, and she feared his growing influence 
on the young king. So she arranged for a member of the Guise family, one 
of the most powernd royal elans in France, to assassinate hirn. 
Secretly, however, Catherine had another plan: She wanted the Hu­
guenots to blame the Guises for killing one of their leaders, and to take re­
venge. With one blow, she would erase or injure two threatening rivals, 
Coligny and the Guise family. Yet both plans went awry. The assassin 
missed his target, only wounding Coligny; knowing Catherine as his 
enemy, he strongly suspected it was she who had set up the attack on hirn, 
and he told the king so. Eventually the failed assassination and the argu­
ments that ensued from it set off achain of events that led to a bloody civil 
war between Catholics and Protestants, culminating in the harrifying Mas­
sacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve, in which thousands of Protestants were 
killed. 
If you have to use a cat's-paw or a scapegoat in an action of great con­
sequence, be very care ful: Too much can go wrong. It is often wiser to use 
such dupes in more innocent endeavors, where mistakes or miscalculations 
will cause no serious harm. 
Finally, there are moments when it is advanta geous to not disguise 
your involvement or responsibility, but rather to take the blame yourself 
far some mistake . If you have power and are secure in it, you should some­
times play the penitent: With a sorrowful look, you ask for forgiveness 
from those weaker than you. It is the ploy of the king who makes a show of 
his own sacrifices far the good of the people. Similarly, upon occasion you 
may want to appear as the agent of punishment in order to instill fear and 
trembling in your subordinate s. Instead of the cat's-paw you show your 
own mighty hand as a threatening gesture. Play such a card sparingly. If 
you play it too often, fear will turn into resentrnent and hatred. Before you 
know it, such emotions will spark a vigorous opposition that will someday 
bring you down. Get in the habit of using a cat's-pa w-it is far safer.

216 LAW 27 THE SCIENCE OF CHARL ATANISM , 
OR HOW TO CREA TE A CULT IN FIVE EASY STEPS 
In searching, as you must, for the methods that will gain you the most 
power for the least effort, you will find the creation of a cultlike following 
one of the most effective. Having a large following opens up all sorts of 
possibilities for deception; not only will your followers worship you, they 
will defend you from your enemies and will voluntarily take on the work of 
enticing others to join your fledgling cult. This kind of power will lift you to 
another realm: You will no longer have to struggle or use subterfuge to en­
force your wilL You are adored and can do no wrong. 
You might think it a gargan tuan task to create such a following, but in 
fact it is fairly simple. As humans, we have adesperate need to believe in 
something, anything. This makes us eminently gullible: We simply cannot 
endure long periods of doubt, or of the emptin ess that comes from a lack of 
something to believe in. Dangle in front of us some new cause, elixir, get­
rich-quick scherne, or the latest technological trend or art movement and 
we leap from the water as one to take the bait. Look at history: The chroni­
des of the new trends and cults that have made a mass following for them­
selves could fill a library. After a few centurie s, a few decades, a few years, 
a few months, they generally look ridiculous, but at the time they seem so 
attractive, so transcendental, so divine. 
Always in a rush to believe in something, we will manufacture saints 
and faiths out of nothing. Do not let this gullibility go to waste: Make your­
self the object of worship . Make people form a cult around you. 
The great European charlatans of the sixteenth and seventeenth cen­
turies mastered the art of cultmaking. They lived, as we do now, in a time 
of transformat ion: Organiz ed religion was on the wane, seience on the rise. 
People were desperate to rally around a new cause or faith. The charlatans 
had begun by peddling health elixirs and alchemie shortcuts to wealth. 
Moving quickly from town to town, they originally focused on small 
groups-until, by accident, they stumbled on a truth of human nature: 
The larger the group they gathered around themselve s, the easier it was to 
deceive. 
The charlatan would station hirnself on a high wooden platform (hence 
the term "mountebank") and crowds would swarm around hirn. In a group 
setting, people were more emotional, less able to reason. Had the charlatan 
spoken to them individually, they might have found hirn ridiculous, but lost 
in a crowd they got caught up in a communal mood of rapt attention. It be­
came impossible for them to find the distance to be skepticaL Any defieien­
eies in the charlata n's ideas were hidden by the zeal of the mass. Passion 
and enthusiasm swept through the crowd like a contagion, and they reacted 
violently to anyone who dared to spread a seed of doubt. Both consciously 
studying this dynamic over decades of experiment and spontaneous ly 
adapting to these situations as they happened, the charlatans perfected the 
seience of attracting and holding a crowd, molding the crowd into followers 
and the followers into a cult. 
The gimmicks of the charlatans may seem quaint today, but there are 
thousands of charlatans among us still, using the same tried-and-true meth­
ods their predecessors refined centuries ago, only changing the names of 
their elixirs and modernizing the look of their cults. We find these latter­
day charlatans in all arenas of life-b usiness, fashion, politics, art. Many of 
them, perhaps, are following in the charlatan tradition without having any 
knowledge of its history, but you can be more systematic and deliberate . 
Simp ly follow the five steps of cultmaking that oUf charlatan ancestors per­
fected over the years . 
Step 1: Keep It Vague; Keep It Simple. To create a cult you must first 
attract attention. This you should do not through actions, which are too 
clear and reada ble, but through words, which are hazy and deceptive. Your 
initial speeches, conversa tions, and interviews must include two elements : 
on the one hand the promise of somet hing great and tran sformative, and 
on the other a total vag ueness. This combination will stimulate all kinds of 
hazy dreams in your listeners, who will make their own connections and 
see what they want to see. 
To make your vaguen ess attrac tive, use words of great resonance but 
cloudy meaning, words full of heat and enth usiasm . Fancy titles for simple 
things are helpful, as are the use of numbers and the creation of new words 
for vague concepts. All of these create the impre ssion of specialized knowl­
edge, giving you aveneer of profund ity. By the same token, try to make the 
subject of YOUf cult new and fresh, so that few will understand it. Done right, 
the combination of vague promises, cloudy but alluring concepts, and fiery 
enthu siasm will stir people's souls and a group will form around you. 
Talk too vaguely and you have no credibility. But it is more dangerous 
to be specific. If you explain in detail the benefits people will gain by fol­
Iowing your cult, you will be exp ected to satisfy them. 
As a corollary to its vaguen ess your appeal should also be simple. 
Most people's problems have complex causes: deep-rooted neurosis, inter­
connected social factors, roots that go way back in time and are exceed­
ingly hard to unra vel. Few, however, have the patience to deal with this; 
most people want to hear that a simple solution will cure their problems. 
The ability to offer this kind of solution will give you great power and build 
you a following. Instead of the complicated explanations of real life, return 
to the primitive solutions of our ancestors, to good old country remedies, to 
mysterious panace as. 
Step 2: Emphasize the Visual and the Sensual over the Intellectual. 
Once people have begun to gather around you, two dangers will present 
themselve s: boredom and skeptici sm. Boredom will make people go else­
where ; skepticism will allow them the distance to think rationally about 
whate ver it is you are offering, blowing away the mist you have artfully cre­
ated and revealing your ideas for what they are. You need to amuse the 
bored, then, and ward off the cynics. eneountered scienee 
and edueation at some 
time, though briefly 
and unsuecessfully ... 
The great mass of 
mankind has always 
been predisposed to 
marvel at mysteries, 
and this was especially 
true at eertain historie 
periods when the 
secure foundations of 
life seemed shaken and 
old' values, eeonomie or 
spiritual, long aceepted 
as certaintie;; eould no 
longer be relied upon. 
Then the numbers of 
the charlatan 's dupes 
multiplied-the "self 
killers," as a seven­
teenth-eentur y English­
man called them.

unnoticed. "You!" said 
the owl. "Who?" they 
quavered, in fear and 
astonishment, for they 
eould not believe it was 
possible for anyone to 
see them in that thick 
darkness. "You two!" 
said the owl. The moles 
hurried away and told 
the other ereatures of 
the jield and forest that 
the owl was the greatest 
and wisest of all 
animals beeause he 
could see in the dark 
LAW 27 217 
and beeause he eould 
answer any question. 
''!'ll see about that," 
said a seeretary bird, 
and he called on the 
owl one night when it 
was aga in very dark. 
"How many claws am I 
holding up?" said the 
secretary bird. "Two," 
said the owl, and that 
was right. "Can you 
give me another 
expression for 'that is 
to say' or 'namely?'" 
asked the secretary 
bird. "To wit," said the 
owl. "Why does a lover 
eall on his love?" asked 
the secretary bird. "To 
woo," said the owl. 
The secretary bird 
hastened baek to the 
other creatures and 
reported that the owl 
was indeed the greatest 
and wisest animal in 
the world becallse he 
could see in the dark 
and because he cOllld 
answer any ljuestion. 
"Can /ze sec in the 
daytime, too?" asked a 
red fox. "Yes," echoed a 
dormouse and a 
French poodle. "Can he 
see in the daytime, 
too?" All the other 
creatures laughed 
loudly at this silly ljues­
tion, and they set upon 
the red fox and his 
friends and drove them 
out ofthe region. Then 
they sent a messen ger 
to the owl and asked 
him to be their leader. 
When the owl appeared 
among the animals it 
was high noon and the 
sun was shining 
brightly. He walked 
very slowly, which gave 
him an appearance of 
great dignity, ami he 
peered ab out him with 
large, staring eye,\; 
which gave him an air 
218 LAW 27 The best way to do this is through theater, or other devices of its kind, 
Surround YOUfselfwith luxury, dazzle YOUf followers with visual splendor, 
fill their eyes with spectacle. Not only will this keep them from seeing the 
ridiculousness of YOUf ideas, the holes in YOUf belief system, it will also at­
tract more attention, more followers. Appeal to all the senses: Use incense 
for scent, soothing music for hearing, colorful charts and graphs for the 
eye. You might even tickle the mind, perhaps by using new technological 
gadgets to give YOUf cult a pseudo-scientific veneer-as long as you do not 
make anyone really think. Use the exotic-distant cultures, strange cus­
toms-to create theatrical effects, and to make the most banal and ordinary 
affairs seem signs of something extraordinary. 
Step 3: Borrow the Forms of Organ ized Religion to Structure the 
Group. YOUf cultlike following is growing; it is time to organize it. Find a 
way both elevating and comforting. Organized religions have long held un­
questioned authority for large numbers of people, and continue to do so in 
OUf supposedly secular age. And even if the religion itself has faded some, 
its forms still resonate with power. The lofty and holy associations of orga­
nized religion can be endlessly exploited. Create rituals for YOUf followers; 
organize them into a hierarchy, ranking them in grades of sanctity, and giv­
ing them names and titles that resound with religious overtones; ask them 
for sacrifices that will fill YOUf coffers and increase your power. To empha­
size YOUf gathering's quasi-religious nature, ta1k and act like a prophet. You 
are not a dictator, after all; you are a priest, a guru, a sage, a shaman, or any 
other word that hides YOUf real power in the mist of religion. 
Step 4: Disguise Your Source of Income. YOUf group has grown, and you 
have structured it in a chUfchHke form. YoUf coffers are beginning to fill 
with your followers' money. Yet you must never be seen as hungry for 
money and the power it brings. It is at this moment that you must disguise 
the SOUfce of your income. 
Your followers want to believe that if they follow you all sorts of good 
things will fall into their lap. By surrounding YOUfself with luxury you be­
come living proof of the soundness of YOUf belief system. Never reveal that 
your wealth actually comes from your followers' pockets; instead, make it 
seem to come from the truth of YOUf methods. Followers will copy YOUf 
each and every move in the belief that it will bring them the same results, 
and their imitative enthusiasm will blind them to the charlatan nature of 
YOUf wealth. 
Step 5: Set Up an Us-V ersus- Them Dynamic. The group is now large 
and thriving, a magnet attracting more and more particles. If you are not 
careful, though, inertia will set in, and time and boredom will demagnetize 
the group. To keep YOUf followers united, you must now do what all reli­
gions and belief systems have done: create an us-versus-them dynamic. 
First, make sure YOUf followers believe they are part of an exclusive 
club, unified by a bond of common goals. Then, to strengthen this bond, 
manufacture the notion of a devious enemy out to ruin you. There is a 
force of nonbelievers that will do anything to stop you. Any outsider who 
tries to reveal the charlatan nature of your belief system can now be de­
scribed as a member of this devious force. 
If you have no enemies, invent one. Given a straw man to react 
against, your followers will tighten and cohere. They have your cause to 
believe in and infidels to destroy. 
OBSER VANCES OF THE LAW 
Observance I 
In the year 1653, a twenty -seven-year-old Milan man named Francesco 
Giuseppe Borri claimed to have had a vision. He went around town telling 
one and all that the archangel Michael had appeared to hirn and an­
nounced that he had been chosen to be the capitano generale of the Army 
of the New Pope, an army that would seize and revitalize the world. 
The archangel had further revealed that Borri now had the power to see 
people's souls, and that he would so on discover the philosopher's stone-a 
long-sought-after substance that could change base metals into gold. 
Friends and acquainta nces who heard Borri explain the vision, and who 
witnessed the change that had come over hirn, were impressed, for Borri 
had previously devoted hirnself to a life of wine, women, and gambling. 
Now he gave all that up, plunging hirnself into the study of alchemy and 
talking only of mysticism and the occult. 
The transformation was so sudden and miracu lous, and Borri's words 
were so filled with enthusiasm, that he began to create a following. Unfor­
tunately the Italian Inquisition began to notice hirn as well-they pro se­
cuted anyone who delved into the occult-so he left Italy and began to 
wander Europe, from Austria to Holland, telling one and all that "to those 
who follow me all joy shall be grahted." Wherever Borri stayed he at­
tracted followers. His method was simple : He spoke of his vision, which 
had grown more and more elaborate , and offered to "look into" the soul of 
anyone who believed hirn (and they were many). Seemingly in a trance, he 
would stare at this new follower for several minutes, then claim to have 
seen the person's soul, degree of enlightenment, and potential for spiritual 
greatness. If what he saw showed promise, he would add the person to his 
growing order of disciple s, an honor indeed. 
The cult had six degre es, into which the disciples were assigned ac­
cording to what Borri had glimpsed in their souls. With work and total de­
votion to the cult they could graduate to a higher degree. Borri-whom 
they called "His Excellency ," and "Universal Doctor"-demanded from 
them the strictest vows of poverty. All the goods and moneys they pos­
sessed had to be tumed over to hirn. But they did not mind handing over 
their property, for Borri had told them, "I shall soon bring my chemical o.f tremenduus impo.r­
tance. "He's Gadl" 
screamed a Plymuuth 
Ruck hen. And the 
uthers tuuk up the cry 
"He's Godl" So. they 
fullowed him wherever 
he went and when he 
began ta bump into 
things they began to. 
bump info things, too. 
Finally he came to. a 
co.ncrete highway and 
he started up the 
middle o.f it and all the 
o.ther creatures 
fo.llowed him. Presently 
a hawk, who was acting 
as o.utrider, o.bserved a 
truck caming toward 
them at fifty mi/es an 
ho.ur, and he reported 
to the secretary bird 
and the secretary bird 
repo.rted to. the owl. 
"There's danger 
ahead," said the sec re­
tary bird. "To wit?" 
said the awl. The sec re­
tary bird told him. 
"Aren't you afraid?" 
He asked. "Who?" said 
the o.wl calmly. fo.r he 
co.uld no.t see the truck. 
"He's Go.dl" cried all 
the creatures again. and 
they were still crying 
"He's Go.dl" when the 
truck hit them and ran 
them down. So.me of 
the animals were 
merely injured. but 
most o.f them, including 
the o.wl. were killed.

Given his growing wealth, Borri began to change his style of living. 
Renting the most splendid apartment in the city into which he had tem­
porarily settled, he would furnish it with fabulous furniture and accessories, 
which he had begun to collect. He would drive through the city in a coach 
studded with jewels, with six magnificent black horses at its head. He never 
stayed too long in one place, and when he disappeared, saying he had 
more souls to gather into his flock, his reputation only grew in his absence. 
He became famous, although in fact he had never done a single concrete 
thing. 
From all over Europe, the blind, the crippled, and the desperate came 
to visit Borri, for word had spread that he had healing powers. He asked no 
fee for his services, which only made hirn seem more marvelous, and in­
deed some claimed that in this or that city he had performed a miracle 
eure. By only hinting at his accomplishments, he encouraged people's 
imaginati ons to blow them up to fantastic proportions. His wealth, for ex­
ample, actually came from the vast sums he was collecting from his in­
creasingly select group of rich disciples; yet it was presumed that he had in 
fact perfected the philosopher's stone. The Church continued to pursue 
hirn, denouncing hirn for heresy and witchcraft, and Borri's response to 
these charges was a dignified silence; this only enha nced his reputation and 
made his followers more passionate . Only the great are persecuted, after 
all; how many understood Jesus Christ in his own time? Borri did not have 
to say a word-his followers now called the Pope the Antichrist. 
And so Borri's power grew and grew, until one day he left the city of 
Amsterdam (where he had settled for a while), absconding with huge sums 
of bOITowed money and diamonds that had been entrusted to hirn. (He 
claimed to be able to remove the flaws from diamonds through the power 
of his gifted mind.) Now he was on the run. The Inquisition eventually 
caught up with him, and for the last twenty years of his life he was impris­
oned in Rome. But so great was the belief in his occult powers that to his 
dying day he was visited by wealthy believers , including Queen Christina 
of Sweden. Supplying hirn with money and materials, these visitors al­
lowed hirn to continue his search for the elusive philosopher's stone. 
Interpretation 
Before he formed his cult, Borri seems to have stumbled on a critical dis­
covery. Tiring of his life of debauchery, he had decided to give it up and to 
devote hirnself to the occult, a genuine int erest of his. He must have no­
ticed, however, that when he alluded to a mystical experience (rather than 
physical exhaustion) as the source of his conversion, people of all classes 
wanted to hear more. Realizing the power he could gain by ascribing the 
change to something external and mysterious, he went further with his 
manufactured visions. The grander the vision, and the more sacrifices he 
asked for, the more appealing and believable his story seemed to become. 
Rememb er: People are not interested in the truth about change. They 
do not want to hear that it has come from hard work, or from anything as 
banal as exhaustion, bore dom, or depression; they are dying to believe in 
sornething romantic, otherworldly. They want to hear of angels and out-of­
body experiences. Indulge them. Hint at the mystical source of some per­
sonal change, wrap it in ethereal colors, and a cultlike following will form 
around you. Adapt to people's needs: The messiah must mirror the desires 
ofhis followers. And always aim high. The bigger and bolder your illusion, 
the better.

In the mid-1700s, word spread in Europe's fashionable society of a Swiss 
eountry doctor named Michael Schüppach who practiced a different kind 
of rnedicine: He used the healing powers of nature to perform miraculous 
eures. Soon well-to-do people from all over the Continent, their ailments 
both serious and mild, were making the trek to the alpine village of Lang­
nau, where Schüppach lived and worked. Trudging through the mountain s, 
these visitors witnessed the most dramatic naturallandscapes that Europe 
has to offer. By the time they reached Langnau, they were already feeling 
transformed and on their way to health. 
Schüppach, who had become known as simply the "Mountain Doc­
tor," had a small pharmacy in town. This place became quite a scene: 
Crowds of people from many different countries would cram the small 
roorn, its walls lined with colorful bottles filled with herbal eures. Where 
most doctors of the time prescribed foul-tasting concoctions that bore in­
cornprehensible Latin titles (as medicines often do still), Schüppach's eures 
had names such as "The Oil of Joy," "Little Flower's Heart," or ''Against 
the Monster," and they tasted sweet and pleasing. 
Visitors to Langnau would have to wait patiently for a visit with the 
Mountain Doctor, because every day some eighty messengers would arrive 
at the pharmacy bearing flasks of urine from all over Europe. Schüppach 
claimed he could diagnose what ailed you simply by looking at a sampie of 
your urine and reading a written description of your ailment. (Naturally he 
read the description very carefully before prescribing a eure.) When he fi­
nally had a spare minute (the urine sampies took up much of his time), he 
would call the visitor into his office in the pharmacy. He would then exam­
ine this person's urine sampie, explaining that its appearance would tell 
hirn everything he needed to know. Country people had a sense for these 
things, he would say-their wisdom came from living a simple, godly life 
with none of the complicat ions of urban living. This personal consultation 
would also include a discussion as to how one might bring one's soul more 
into harmony with nature. 
Schüppach had devised many forms of treatment, each profoundly un­
like the usual medical practices of the time. He was a believer, for instance, 
in electric shock therapy. To those who wondered whether this was in 
keeping with his belief in the healing power of nature, he would explain 
that electricity is a natural phenomenon; he was merely imitating the the fabulous establish­
ment he opened in 
London for the sale of 
his elixirs .... In the

received patient s, stood

devils. The doctor cured hirn with electrical shocks, and as he administered 
these he exclaimed that he could see the devils flying out of the man's 
body, one by one. Another man claimed to have swallowed a hay wagon 
and its driver, whieh were causing hirn massive pains in the ehest. The 
Mountain Doctor listened patiently, claimed to be able to hear the crack of 
a whip in the man's belly, promised to eure hirn, and gave hirn asedative 
and a purgative. The man fell asleep on a ehair outside the pharmacy. As 
so on as he awoke he vomited, and as he vomited a hay wagon sped past 
hirn (the Mountain Doctor had hired it for the occasion), the crack of its 
whip making hirn feel that somehow he had indeed expelled it under the 
doctor's care. 
Over the years, the Mountain Doctor's farne grew. He was consulted 
by the powerful-even the writer Goethe made the trek to his village-and 
he becarne the center of a cult of nature in whieh everything natural was 
considered worthy of worship . Sehüppaeh was careful to create effects that 
would entertain and inspire his patients. A professor who visited hirn once 
wrote, "One stands or sits in company, one plays cards, sometimes with a 
young woman; now a concert is given, now a luneh or supper, and now a 
little ballet is presented. With a very happy effect, the freedom of nature is 
everywhere united with the pleasures of the beau monde, and if the doctor 
is not able to heal any diseases, he can at least eure hypoehondria and the 
vapors." 
Interpretation 
Schüppach had begun his career as an ordinary village doctor. He would 
sometimes use in his practice some of the village remedies he had grown 
up with, and apparently he noticed some results, for soon these herbal tinc­
tures and natural forms ofhealing became his specialty. And in fact his nat­
ural form of healing did have profound psyehological effects on his 
patients. Where the normal drugs of the time created fear and pain, Schüp­
pach's treatments were comfortable and soothing. The resulting improve­
ment in the patient's mood was a critical element in the eures he brou ght 
about. His patients believed so deeply in his skills that they willed them­
selves into health. Instead of scoffing at their irrational explanations for 
their ailments, Schüppach used their hypochondria to make it seem that he 
had effected a great eure . 
The caseof the Mountain Doctor teaches us valuable lessons in the 
creation of a cultlike following. First, you must find a way to engage peo­
ple's will, to make their belief in your powers strong enough that they 
imagine all sorts of benefits. Their belief will have a self-fulfilling quality, 
but you must make sure that it is you, rather than their own will, who is 
seen as the agent of transformati on. Find the belief, cause, or fantasy that 
will make them believe with a passion and they will imagine the rest, wor­
shipping you as healer, prophet, genius, whatever you like. 
Second, Schüppach teaches us the everlasting power of belief in na­
ture, and in simplic ity. Nature, in reality, is full of much that is terrifying­
poisonous plants, fierce animal s, sudden disasters, plagues. Belief in the 
healing, comforting quality of nature is really a constructed myth, a roman­
ticism. But the appeal to nature can bring you great power, especia lly in 
cornplicated and stressful times. 
This appeal, however, must be handled right. Devise a kind of theater 
of nature in which you, as the director, pick and choose the qualities that fit 
the romanticism of the times. The Mountain Doctor played the part to per­
fection, playing up his homespun wisdom and wit, and staging his eures as 
drarnatic pieces. He did not make hirnself one with nature; instead he 
molded nature into a cult, an artificial construction. To create a "natural" 
effect you actually have to work hard, making nature theatrical and de­
lightfully pagan. Otherwise no one will notice. Nature too must follow 
trends and be progressive.

In 1788, at the age of fifty-five, the doctor and scientist Franz Mesmer was 
at a crossroads. He was a pioneer in the study of animal magnetism-the 
belief that animals contain magnetic matter, and that a doctor or specialist 
can effect miraculous eures by working on this charged substance-but in 
Vienna, where he lived, his theories had met with scom and ridicule from 
the medical establishment. In treating women for convulsions, Mesmer 
clairned to have worked a number of eures, his proudest achievement 
being the restoration of sight to a blind girl. But another doctor who exam­
ined the young girl said she was as blind as ever, an assessment with which 
she herself agreed. Mesmer countered that his enemies were out to slander 
hirn by winning her over to their side. This claim only elicited more 
ridicule. Clearly the sober-minded Viennese were the wrong audience for 
his theories, and so he decided to move to Paris and start again. 
Renting a splendid apartment in his new city, Mesmer decorated it ap­
propriately. Stained glass in most of the windows created a religious feel­
ing, and mirrors on all the walls produced an hypnotic effect. The doctor 
advertised that in his apartment he would give demonstrations of the pow­
ers of animal magnetism, inviting the diseased and melancholie to fee! its 
powers. Soon Parisians of all classes (but mostly women, who seemed more 
attracted to the idea than men did) were paying for entry to witness the 
miracles that Mesmer promised. 
Inside the apartm ent, the scents of orange blossom and exotic incense 
wafted through special vents. As the initiates filtered into the salon where 
the demon strations took place, they heard harp music and the lulling 
sounds of a female vocalist coming from another room. In the center of the 
salon was a long oval container filled with water that Mesmer claimed had 
been magnetiz ed. From holes in the container's metallid protruded long 
movable iron rods. The visitors were instructed to sit around the container, 
place these magnetized rods on the body part that gave them pains or 
problems, and then hold hands with their neighb ors, sitting as close as pos­
sible to one another to help the magnetic force pass between their bodies. 
Sometim es, too, they were attached to each other by cords. 
Mesmer would leave the room, and "assistant magnet izers"-all hand-T//L I'()\ \ /,:11 <H ,\ I.W

224 LAW 27 some and strapping young men-would enter with jars of magnetized 
water that they would sprinkle on the patients, rubbing the healing fluid on 
their bodies, massaging it into their skin, moving them toward a trancelike 
state. And after a few minutes a kind of delirium would overcome the 
women. Some would sob, some would shriek and tear their hair, others 
would laugh hysterically_ At the height of the delirium Mesmer would 
reenter the salon, dressed in a flowing silk robe embroidered with golden 
flowers and carrying a white magnetic rod. Moving around the container, 
he would stroke and soothe the patients until calm was restored. Many 
women would later attribute the strange power he had on them to his 
piercing look, which, they thought, was exciting or quieting the magnetic 
fluids in their bodies. 
Within months of his arrival in Paris, Mesmer became the rage. His 
supporters included Marie-Antoinette herself, the queen of France, wife of 
Louis XVL As in Vienna, he was condemned by the official faculty of med­
icine, but it did not matter. His growing following of pupils and patients 
paid hirn handsome ly_ 
Mesmer expanded his theories to proclaim that all humanity could be 
brought into harmony through the power of magnetism, a concept with 
much appeal during the French Revolution. A cult of Mesmerism spread 
across the country; in many towns, "Societies of Harmony" sprang up to 
experiment with magnetism. These societies eventually became notorious : 
They tended to be led by libertines who would turn their sessions into a 
kind of group orgy. 
At the height of Mesmer's popularity, a French commission published 
areport based on years of testing the theory of animal magnetism. The 
conclusion : Magnetism's effects on the body actually came from a kind of 
group hysteria and autosugge stion. The report was well documented, and 
ruined Mesmer's reputation in France. He left the country and went into 
retirement. Only a few years later, however, imitators sprang up all over 
Europe and the cult of Mesmerism spread once again, its believers more 
numerous than ever. 
Interpretation 
Mesmer's career can be broken into two parts. When still in Vienna, he 
clearly believed in the validity of his theory, and did all he could to prove 
it. But his growing frustration and the disapproval of his colleagues made 
hirn adopt another strategy. First he moved to Paris, where no one knew 
him, and where his extravagant theories found a more fruitful soH. Then he 
appealed to the French love of theater and spectacle, making his apartment 
into a kind of magical world in which a sensory overload of smells, sights, 
and sounds entranced his customers. Most irnportant, from now on he 
practiced his magnetism only on a group_ The group provided the setting 
in which the magnetism would have its proper effect, one believer infecting 
the other, overwhelming any individual doubter. 
Mesmer thus passed from being a confirmed advocate of magnetism 
to the role of a charlatan using every trick in the book to captivate the pub-
He. The biggest trick of all was to play on the repressed sexuality that bub­
bles under the surface of any group setting. In a group, a longing for social 
unity, a longing older than civilization, cries out to be awakened. This de­
sire rnay be subsumed under a unifying cause, but beneath it is a repressed 
sexuality that the charlatan knows how to exploit and manipulate for his 
own purposes. 
This is the lesson that Mesmer teaches us: Our tendency to doubt, the 
distance that allows us to reason, is broken down when we join a group. 
The warmth and inf ectiousness of the group overwh elm the skeptical indi­
vidual. This is the power you gain by creating a cult. Also, by playing on 
people's repressed sexuality, you lead them into mistaking their excited 
feelings for signs of your mystical strength. You gain untold power by 
working on people's unrealized desire for a kind of promiscuous and 
pagan unity. 
Remember too that the most effective cuIts mix religion with science. 
Take the latest technological trend or fad and blend it with a noble cause, a 
mystical faith, a new form of healing. People's interpretat ions of your hy­
brid cuIt will run rampant, and they will attribute powers to you that you 
had never even thought to claim. 
Image: The Magnet. An unseen force draws objects to it, 
whieh in turn become magnetized themselves, drawing other 
pieees to them, the magnetie power of tlle whole constantly 
increasing. But take away the original magnet and it all falls 
apart. Become the magnet, the invisible farce that attracts 
people's imaginat ions and holds them together. Onee they 
have clustered around you, no power can wrest them away. 
Authority: The eharlatan achieves his great power by simply opening 
a possibility far men to believe what they already want to believe .... 
The eredulous eannot keep at a distance; they erowd around the

LAW 27 225 
226 LAW 27 REVERSAL 
One reason to create a following is that a group is often easier to deceive 
than an individual, and turns over to you that much more power. This 
comes, however, with a danger: If at any moment the group sees through 
you, you will find yourself facing not one deceived soul but an angry crowd 
that will tear you to pieces as avidly as it once followed you. The charlatans 
constantly faced this danger, and were always ready to move out of town as 
it inevitably became clear that their elixirs did not work and their ideas 
were sham. Too slow and they paid with their lives. In playing with the 
crowd, you are playing with fire, and must constantly keep an eye out far 
any sparks of doubt, any enemies who will turn the crowd against you. 
When you play with the emotions of a crowd, you have to know how to 
adapt, attuning yourself instantan eously to all of the moods and desires that 
a group will produce. Use spies, be on top of everything, and keep yOUf 
bags packed. 
For this reason you may often prefer to deal with people one by one. 
Isolating them from their normal milieu can have the same effect as putting 
them in a group--it makes them more prone to suggestion and intimida­
tion. Choose the right sucker and if he eventually sees through you he may 
prove easier to escape than a crowd.

228 LAW 28 BOLDNE SS AN D HESIT A TI ON: A Brief Psychological Camparisan 
Boldness and hesitation elicit very different psychological responses in their 
targets : Hesitation puts obstacles in your path, boldness eHminates them. 
Once you understand this, you will find it essential to overcome your nat­
ural timidity and practice the art of audacity. The following are among the 
most pronounc ed psychological effects of boldness and timidity. 
The Bolder the Lie the Bet ter. We all have weak nesses, and our efforts 
are never perfeet. But entering action with boldness has the magical effect 
of hiding our deficiencie s. Con artists know that the bolder the He, the 
more convincing it becomes. The sheer audacity of the story makes it more 
credible, distracting atte ntion from its inconsist encies. Wh en putting to­
gether a con or entering any kind of negotiati on, go further than you 
plann ed. Ask for the mo on and you will be surpri sed how often you get it. 
Lions Circle the Hesitant Prey. People have a sixth sense for the weak­
nesses of others. If, in a first encounter, you demons trate your willingness 
to compromise, back down, and retreat, you bring out the Hon even in peo­
pIe who are not necess arily bloo dthirst y. Everything depends on percep­
tion, and once you are seen as the kind of person who quickly goes on the 
defensive, who is willing to negotiate and be amenable, you will be pushed 
around without mercy. 
Boldness Strikes Fear; Fear Creates Autho rity. The bald move makes 
you seem larger and more powerful than you are. If it comes suddenly, 
with the stealth and swift ness of a snake, it inspires that much more fear. By 
intimidating with a bald move, you esta bHsh a precedent: in every sub se­
quent encounter, people will be on the defensi ve, in terror of your next 
strike. 
Going Halfway with Half a Heart Digs the Deeper Grave. If you 
enter an action with less than total confidence, you set up obstacles in your 
own path. Wh en a problem arises you will grow confused, seeing options 
where there are none and inadvertently creating more problems still. Re­
treating from the hunter, the timid hare scurries more easily into his snares. 
Hesitat ion Creates Gaps, Boldness Obliterates Them. Wh en you take 
time to think, to hem and haw, you create a gap that allows others time to 
think as weH. Your timidity infects people with awkwar d energy, elicits em­
barrassment. Doubt springs up on all sides. 
Boldness destroys such gap s. The swift ness of the move and the energy 
of the action leave others no space to doubt and worry. In seduction, hesi­
tation is fatal-it makes your victim conscious of your intent ions. The bald

OBSERVANCES OF THE LAW 
Observance I 
In May of 1925, five of the most successful dealers in the French scrap­
metal business found themselves invited to an "official" but "highly confi­
dential" meeting with the deputy director general of the Ministry of Post 
and Telegraphs at the Hotel Crillon, then the most luxurious hotel in Paris. 
When the businessmen arrived, it was the director general himself, a Mon­
sieur Lustig, who met them in a swank suite on the top floor. 
The businessmen had no idea why they had been summoned to this 
meeting, and they were bursting with curiosity. Mter drinks, the director 
explained. "Gentlemen," he said, "this is an urgent matter that requires 
complete secrecy. The government is going to have to tear down the Eiffel 
Tower." The dealers listened in stunned silence as the director explained 
that the tower, as recently reported in the news, desperately needed re­
pairs. It had originally been meant as a temporary structure (for the Expo­
sition of 1889), its maintenance costs had soared over the years, and now, 
in a time of a fiscal crisis, the government would have to spend millions to 
fix it. Many Parisians considered the Eiffel Tower an eyesore and would be 
delighted to see it go. Over time, even the tourists would forget about it-it 
would live on in photographs and postcards. "Gentlemen," Lustig said, 
"you are all invited to make the government an offer for the Eiffel Tower." 
He gave the businessmen sheets of government stationery filled with 
figures, such as the tonnage of the tower's metal. Their eyes popped as they 
calculated how much they could make from the scrap. Then Lustig led 
them to a waiting limo, which brought them to the Eiffel Tower. Flashing 
an official badge, he guided them through the area, spicing his tour with 
amusing anecdotes. At the end of the visit he thanked them and asked 
them to have their offers delivered to his suite within four days. 
Several days after the offers were submitted, one of the five, a Mon­
sieur P., received notice that his bid was the winner, and that to secure the 
sale he should come to the suite at the hotel within two days, bearing a cer­
tified check for more than 250,000 francs (the equivalent today of about 
$1,OOO,OOO)-a quarter of the total price. On delivery of the check, he 
would receive the documents confirming his ownership of the Eiffel Tower. 
Monsieur P. was excited-he would go down in history as the man who 
had bought and tom down the infamous landmark. But by the time he ar­
rived at the suite, check in hand, he was beginning to have doubts about 
the whole affair. Why meet in a hotel instead of a government building? 
Why hadn't he heard from other officials? Was this a hoax, ascam? As he 
listened to Lustig discuss the arrangements for the scrapping of the tower, 
he hesitated, and contemplated backing out. be the dwarf figure of 
an elephant. fit only to 
be placed on the top of 
a stick; and then what 
honor would there be 
in such an adventure? 
"There is," said he. 
"some deeeption in this 
writing. It is an enigma 
only fit to amuse a 
chi/d. I shall therefore 
leave you and your 
elephant." 
The reasoner then 
departed; but the 
adventurous man 
rushed with his eyes 
closed across the water; 
neither depth nor 
violence prevented 
hirn, and according to 
the inscri ption he saw 
the elephant lying on 
the opposite bank. 
He took it and carried 
it to the top of the hili, 
where he saw a town. A 
shriek from the 
elephant alarmed the 
people ofthe city, who 
rose in arms; but the 
adventurer, nothing 
daunted. was deter­
mined to die a hero.

In a lowly thatehed

out ofdoors .... Arriv-
ing in the heart of the 
230 LAW 28 Suddenly, however, he realized that the director had changed his tone. 
Instead of talking about the tower, he was complaining about his low 
salary, about his wife's desire for a fur coat, about how galling it was to 
work hard and be unapprecia ted. It dawned on Monsieur P. that this high 
government official was asking for abribe. The effect on hirn, though, was 
not outrage but relief. Now he was sure that Lustig was for real, since in all 
of his previous encounters with French bureaucrats, they had inevitably 
asked for a litde greasing of the palm. His confidence restored, Monsieur P. 
slipped the director several thousand francs in bills, then handed hirn the 
certified check. In return he received the documentation, including an im­
pressive-Iooking bill of sale. He left the hotel, dreaming of the profits and 
farne to come. 
Over the next few days, however, as Monsieur P. waited for corre­
spondence from the government, he began to realize that something was 
amiss. A few telephone calls made it clear that there was no deputy direc­
tor general Lustig, and there were no plans to destroy the Eiffel Tower: He 
had been bilked of over 250,000 francs! 
Monsieur P. never went to the police. He knew what kind of reputa­
tion he would get if word got out that he had fallen for one of the most ab­
surdly audacious cons in history. Besides the public humiliation, it would 
have been business suicide . 
Interpretation 
Had Count Victor Lustig, con artist extraordinaire, tried to sell the Arc de 
Triomphe, a bridge over the Seine, astatue of Balzac, no one would have 
believed him. But the Eiffel Tower was just too large, to� improbable to be 
part of a con job. In fact it was so improbable that Lustig was able to return 
to Paris six months later and "resell" the Eiffel Tower to a different scrap­
iron dealer, and for a higher price-a sum in francs equivalent today to 
over $1,500,000! 
Largen ess of scale deceives the human eye. It distracts and awes us, 
and is so self-evident that we cannot imagine there is any illusion or decep­
tion afoot. Arm yourself with bigness and boldness -stretch your decep­
tions as far as they will go and then go further. If you sense that the sucker 
has suspicions, do as the intrepid Lustig did: Instead of backing down, or 
lowering his price, he simply raised his price higher, by asking for and get­
ting abribe. Asking for more puts the other person on the defensive, cuts 
out the nibbling effect of compromise and doubt, and overwhelms with its 
boldness. 
Observance II 
On his deathbed in 1533, Vasily III, the Grand Duke of Moscow and ruler 
of a semi-united Russia, proclaimed his three-year-old son, Ivan IV, as his 
successor. He appointed his young wife, Helena, as regent until Ivan 
reached his majority and could rule on his own. The aristocra cy-the bo­
yars-secredy rejoiced: For years the dukes of Moscow had been trying to 
extend their authority over the boyars' turf. With Vasily dead, his heir a 
mere three years old, and a young woman in charge of the dukedom, the 
boyars would be able to roll back the dukes' gains, wrest control of the 
state, and humiliate the royal family. 
Aware of these dangers, young Helena tumed to her trusted friend 
Prince Ivan Obolensky to help her rule. But after five years as regent she 
suddenly died-poisoned by a member of the Shuisky family, the most 
fearsome boyar clan. The Shuisky princes seized control of the govem­
ment and threw Obolensky in prison, where he starved to death. At the age 
of eight, Ivan was now a despised orphan, and any boyar or family mem­
ber who took an interest in hirn was immediately banished or killed. 
And so Ivan roamed the palace, hungry, ill clothed, and often in hid­
ing from the Shuiskys, who treated hirn roughly when they saw hirn. On 
some days they would search hirn out, clothe hirn in royal robes, hand him 
a scepter, and set hirn on the throne-a kind of mock ritual in which they 
lampooned his royal pretensions. Then they would shoo hirn away. One 
evening several of them chased the Metropolitan-the head of the Russian 
church-t hrough the palace, and he sought refuge in Ivan's room; the boy 
watched in horror as the Shuiskys entered, hurled insults, and beat the 
Metropolitan mercilessl y. 
Ivan had one friend in the palace, a boyar named Vorontsov who con­
soled and advised hirn. One day, however, as he, Vorontsov, and the 
newest Metropolitan conferred in the palace refectory, several Shuiskys 
burst in, beat up Vorontsov, and insulted the Metropolitan by tearing and 
treading on his robes. Then they banished Vorontsov from Moscow. 
Throughout all this Ivan maintain ed a strict silence. To the boyars it 
seemed that their plan had worked: The young man had tumed into a ter­
rified and obedient idiot. They could ignore hirn now, even leave hirn 
alone. But on the evening of December 29, 1543, Ivan, now thirteen, asked 
Prince Andrei Shuisky to come to his room. When the prince arrived, the 
room was filled with palace guards. Young Ivan then pointed his finger at 
Andrei and ordered the guards to arrest hirn, have hirn killed, and throw 
his body to the bloodhounds in the royal kennel. Over the next few days 
Ivan had all of Andrei's close associates arrested and banished. Caught off­
guard by his sudden boldness, the boyars now stood in mortal terror of this 
youth, the future Ivan the Terrible, who had planned and waited for five 
years to execute this one swift and bold act that would secure his power for 
decades to come. 
Interpretat ion 
The world is full of boyars-men who despise you, fear your ambition, and 
jealously guard their shrinking realms of power. You need to establish your 
authority and gain respect, but the moment the boyars sense your growing 
boldness, they will act to thwart you. This is how Ivan met such a situation: 
He lay low, showing neither ambition nor discontent. He waited, and when 
the time came he brought the palace guards over to his side. The guards 
had come to hate the cruel Shuiskys. Once they agreed to Ivan's plan, he 
struck with the swiftness of a snake, pointing his finger at Shuisky and giv­
ing hirn no time to react. 
Negotiate with a boyar and you create opportunities for hirn. A small city, he stopped a pass­
ing gentleman. "Hello, 
my friend! Who is the 
richest man in town?" 
"Poor countryman!

house pierced by twelve 
gates is just over there. " 
Huh Saeng bent his 
steps to the rich man's 
house. Having entered 
the big gate, he flung 
the guest-room door 
open and addressed the 
host: "I need 10,000

"Very weil, sir. I will

"Good-bye, sir."

Observance III 
In 1514 the twenty-two-year-o ld Pietro Aretino was working as a lowly as­
sistant scullion to a wealthy Roman family. He had ambitions of greatness 
as a writer, to enflame the world with his name, but how could a mere 
lackey hope to realize such dreams? 
That year Pope Leo X received from the king of Portugal an embassy 
that included many gifts, most prominent among them a great elephant, 
the first in Rome since imperial times. The pontiff adored this elephant and 
showered it with attention and gifts. But despite his love and care, the ele­
phant, which was called Hanno, became deathly ill. The pope summoned 
doctors, who administered a five-hundred-pound purgative to the ele­
phant, but all to no avail. The animal died and the pope went into moum­
ing, To console hirnself he summoned the great painter Raphael and 
ordered hirn to create a life-sized painting of Hanno above the animal's 
tomb, bearing the inscription, "What nature took away, Raphael has with 
his art restored." 
Over the next few days, a pamphlet circulated throughout Rome that 
caused great merriment and laughter. Entitled "The Last Will and Testa­
ment of the Elephant Hanno," it read, in part, "To my heir the Cardinal 
Santa Croce, I give my knees, so that he can imitate my genufle ctions ... , 
To my heir Cardinal Santi Quattro, I give my jaws, so that he can more 
readily devour all of Christ's revenues .... To my heir Cardinal Medici, I 
give my ears, so that he can hear everyone 's doings ... ," To Cardinal 
Grassi, who had areputation for lechery, the elephant bequeathed the ap­
propriate, oversized part of his own anatomy. 
On and on the anonymous pamphlet went, sparing none of the great 
in Rome, not even the pope. With each one it took aim at their best-known 
weakness. The pamphlet ended with verse, "See to it that Aretino is your 
friend / For he is a bad enemy to have. / His words alone could ruin the 
high pope / So God guard everyone from his tongue." 
Interpret ation 
With one short pamphlet, Aretino, son of a poor shoemaker and a servant 
hirnself, hurled hirns elf to farne. Everyone in Rome rushed to find out who 
this daring young man was. Even the pope, amused by his audacity, sought 
hirn out and ended up giving hirn a job in the papal service. Over the years 
he came to be known as the "Scourge of Princes," and his biting tongue 
earned him the respect and fear of the great, from the king of Fran ce to the 
Hapsburg emperor. 
The Aretino strategy is simple: When you are as small and obscure as 
David was, you must find a Goliath to attack The larger the target, the 
more attention you gain. The bolder the attack, the more you stand out 
from the crowd, and the more admirat ion you earn. Society is full of those 
who think daring thoughts but lack the guts to print and publicize them. 
Voice what the public feels-the expression of shared feelings is always 
powerful. Search out the most prominent target possible and sling yoUf 
boldest shot. The world will enjoy the spectacle , and will honor the under­
dog-y ou, that is-with glory and power. 
KEYS TO POWER 
Most of us are timid. We want to avoid tension and conflict and we want to 
be liked by all. We may contemplate a bold action but we rarely bring it to 
life. We are terrified of the consequences, of what others might think of us, 
of the hostility we will stir up if we dare go beyond OUf usual place. 
Although we may disguise OUf timidity as a concern for others, a de­
sire not to hurt or offend them, in fact it is the opposite-we are really self­
absorbed, worried about oUfselves and how others perceive uso Boldness, 
on the other hand, is outer-directed, and often makes people feel more at 
ease, since it is less self-conscious and less repressed. 
This can be seen most clearly in seduction. All great seducers succeed 
through effrontery. Casanova' s boldness was not revealed in a daring ap­
proach to the woman he desired, or in intrepid words to flatter her; it con­
sisted in his ability to surrender himself to her completely and to make her 
believe he would do anything for her, even risk his life, which in fact he 
sometimes did. The woman on whom he lavished this attention under­
stood that he held nothing back from her. This was infinitely more flatter­
ing than compliments. At no point during the seduction would he show 
hesitation or doubt, simply because he never feIt it. 
Part of the charm of being seduced is that it makes us feel engulfed, 
temporarily outside of oUfselves and the usual doubts that permeate our 
Jives. The moment the seducer hesitate s, the charm is broken, because we 
become aware of the process, of their deliberate effort to seduce us, of 
their self-consciousness. Boldness directs attention outward and keeps 
the illusion alive. It never induces awkwa rdness or embarrassment. And 
so we admire the bold, and prefer to be around them, because their self­
confidence infects us and draws us outside OUf own realm of inwardness 
and reflection. 
Few are born bold. Even Napoleon had to cultivate the habit on the 
battlefield, where he knew it was a matter of life and death. In social set­
tings he was awkward and timid, but he overcame this and practiced bold­
ness in every part of his life because he saw its tremendous power, how it 
could literally enlarge a man (even one who, like Napoleon, was in fact 
conspicuously small). We also see this change in Ivan the Terrible: A harm­
less boy suddenly transforms himself into a powerful young man who com­
mands authority, simply by pointing a finger and taking bold action. 
You must practice and develop YOUf boldness. You will often find uses 
for it. The best place to begin is often the delicate world of negotiat ion, par-THE BOY Ar\D

234 LAW 28 ticularly those discussions in which you are asked to set your own price. 
How often we put ourselves down by asking for too little. When Christo­
pher Columbus proposed that the Spanish court finance his voyage to the 
Americas, he also made the insanely bold demand that he be called 
"Grand Admiral of the Ocean." The court agreed. The price he set was the 
price he received-he demanded to be treated with respect, and so he was. 
Henry Kissinger too knew that in negotiation, bold demands work better 
than starting off with piecemeal concessions and trying to meet the other 
person halfway. Set your value high, and then, as Count Lustig did, set it 
higher. 
Understand : If boldness is not natural, neither is timidity. It is an ac­
quired habit, picked up out of adesire to avoid conflict. If timidity has 
taken hold of you, then, root it out. Your fe ars of the consequences of a 
bold action are way out of proportion to reality, and in fact the conse­
quences of timidity are worse. Your value is lowered and you create a self­
fulfilling cyde of doubt and disaster. Rememb er: The problems created by 
an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater 
audacity. 
Image: The Lion and the 
Hare. The lion creates no 
gaps in his way-his 
movements are too 
swift, his jaws too quick 
and powerful. The 
timid hare will do any­
thing to escape danger, 
but in its haste to 
retreat and flee, it backs 
into traps, hops smack 
into its enemies' jaws. 
Authority: I certainly think that it is better to be impetuous than 
cautious, for fortune is a woman, and it is necessary, if you wish to 
master her, to conquer her by force; and it can be seen that she lets 
herself be overcome by the bold rather than by those who proceed 
coldly. And therefore, like a woman, she is always a friend to 
the young, because they are less cautious, fiercer, and master 
her with greater audacity. (Niccolö Machiavelli, 1469-1527) 
REVERSAL 
Boldness should never be the strategy behind all of your actions. It is a tac­
tical instrument, to be used at the right moment. Plan and think ahead, and 
make the final element the bold move that will bring you success. In other 
words, since boldness is a leamed response, it is also one that you leam to 
control and utilize at will. To go through life armed only with audacity 
would be tiring and also fatal. You would offend too many people, as is 
proven by those who cannot control their boldness. One such person was 
Lola Montez; her audacity brought her triumphs and led to her seduction 
of the king of Bavaria. But since she could never rein in her boldness, it 
also led to her downfall-in Bavaria, in England, wherever she tumed. It 
crossed the border between boldness and the appearance of cruelty, even 
insanity. Ivan the Terrible suffered the same fate: When the power of bold­
ness brought hirn success, he stuck to it, to the point where it became a life­
long pattern of violence and sadism. He lost the ability to tell when 
boldness was appropriate and when it was not. 
Timidity has no place in the realm of power; you will often benefit, 
however, by being able to feign it. At that point, of course, it is no longer 
timidity but an offensive weapon: You are luring people in with your show 
of shyness, all the better to pounce on them boldly later.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW 
In 1510 a ship set out from the island of Hispaniola (now Haiti and the 
Dominican Republic) for Venezuela, where it was to rescue a besieged 
Spanish colony. Several miles out of port, a stowaway climbed out of a 
provision ehest: Va sco Nufiez de Balboa, a noble Spaniard who had come 
to the New World in search of gold but had fallen into debt and had es­
eaped his creditors by hiding in the ehest. 
Balboa had been obsessed with gold ever since Columbus had re­
turned to Spain from his voyages with tales of a fabulous but as yet undis­
eovered kingdom called EI Dorado. Balboa was one of the first 
adventurers to come in search of Columbus's land of gold, and he had de­
eided from the beginning that he would be the one to find it, through 
sheer audacity and single-mi ndedness. Now that he was free of his credi­
tors, nothing would stop hirn. 
Unfortunately the ship's owner, a wealthy jurist named Francisco Fer­
nändez de Enciso, was furious when told of the stowaway, and he ordered 
that Balboa be left on the first island they came acro ss. Before they found 
any island, however, Enciso received news that the colony he was to res­
eue had been abandoned. This was Balboa's chance. He told the sailors of 
his previous voyages to Panama, and of the rumors he had heard of gold 
in the area. The excited sailors convinced Enciso to spare Balboa's life, 
and to establish a colony in Panama. Weeks later they named their new 
settlement "Darien." 
Darien's first governor was Enciso, but Balboa was not a man to let 
others steal the initiative. He campaigned against Enciso among the 
sailors, who eventually made it clear that they preferred hirn as governor. 
Enciso fled to Spain, fearing for his life. Months later, when a representa­
tive of the Spanish crown arrived to establish hirnself as the new, official 
governor of Darien, he was turned away. On his return voyage to Spain, 
this man drowned; the drowning was accidental, but under Spanish law, 
Balboa had murdered the governor and usurped his position. 
Balboa's bravado had got hirn out of scrapes before, but now his 
hopes of wealth and glory seemed doomed. To lay claim to EI Dorado, 
should he discover it, he would need the approval of the Spanish king­
which, as an outlaw, he would never receive. There was only one solution. 
Panamanian Indians had told Balboa of a vast ocean on the other side of 
the Central American isthmus, and had said that by traveling south upon 
this western coast, he would reach a fabulous land of gold, called by a 
name that to his ears sounded like "Biru." Balboa decided he would cross 
the treacherous jungles of Panama and become the first European to bathe 
his feet in this new ocean. From there he would march on EI Dorado. If he 
did this on Spain's behalf, he would obtain the eternal gratitude of the 
king, and would seeure his own reprieve-only he had to act before Span­
ish authorities came to arrest hirn. 
In 1513, then, Balboa set out, with 190 soldiers. Halfway across the 
isthmus (some ninety miles wide at that point), only sixty soldiers re-There are very few

In ancient tim es a king 
of Tartary was out 
walking with some of 
his noblemen. At the 
roadside was an abdal 
(a wandering Sufi), 
who cried out: 
"Whoever will give me 
a hundred dinars, 1 will 
give hirn some 
good advice." 
The king stopped, and 
said: "Abdal, what is 
this good advice for a 
hundred dinars?" 
"Sir," answered the 
abdal, "order the sum 
to be given to me, and 1 
will tell it you immedi­
ately." The king did so, 
expecting to hear some­
thing extraordinary. 
The dervish said to 
hirn: "My advic<' is this: 
Never bel(in anything 
until you have reflected 
what will be the end of 
it." At this the nobles 
and everyone else 
present laughed, saying 
that the abdal had been 
wise to ask jor his 
money in advance. BU! 
the king said: "You 
have no reason to 
laugh at the good 
advice this abdal has 
given me. No one is 
238 LAW 29 mained, many having succumbed to the harsh conditions-the blood­
sucking insects, the torrential rainfall, fever. Finally, from a mountaintop, 
Balboa became the first European to lay eyes on the Pacific Ocean. Days 
later he marched in his armor into its waters, bearing the banner of Castile 
and claiming all its seas, lands, and islands in the name of the Spanish 
throne. 
Indians from the area greeted Balboa with gold, jewels, and precious 
pearls, the like of which he had never seen. When he asked where these 
had come from, the Indians pointed south, to the land of the Incas. But 
Balboa had only a few soldiers left. For the moment, he decided, he 
should return to Darien, send the jewels and gold to Spain as a token 
of good will, and ask for a large army to aid hirn in the conquest of EI 
Dorado, 
When news reached Spain of Balboa's bold crossing of the isthmus, 
his discovery of the western ocean, and his planned conquest of EI Do­
rado, the former criminal became a hero, He was instantly proclaimed 
governor of the new land. But before the king and queen received word of 
his discovery, they had already sent a dozen ships, under the command of 
a man named Pedro Arias Davila, "Pedrarias ," with orders to arrest Bal­
boa for murder and to take command of the colony. By the time Pedrarias 
arrived in Panama, he had learned that Balboa had been pardoned, and 
that he was to share the governorship with the former outlaw. 
All the same, Balboa felt uneasy, Gold was his dream, EI Dorado his 
only desire. In pursuit of this goal he had nearly died many times over, 
and to share the wealth and glory with a newcomer would be intolerable, 
He also soon discovered that Pedrarias was a jealous, bitter man, and 
equally unhappy with the situation. Once again, the only solution for Bal­
boa was to seize the initiative by propos ing to cross the jungle with a 
larger army, carrying ship-building materials and tools. Once on the Pa­
cific coast, he would create an armada with which to conquer the Incas. 
Surprisingly enough, Pedrarias agreed to the plan-perhaps sensing it 
would never work. Hundreds died in this second march through the jun­
gle, and the timber they carried rotted in the torrential rains. Balboa, as 
usual, was undaunted-no power in the world could thwart his plan-and 
on arriving at the Pacific he began to cut down trees for new lumb er. But 
the men remaining to hirn were to� few and too weak to mount an inva­
sion, and once again Balboa had to return to Darien, 
Pedrarias had in any case invited Balboa back to discuss a new plan, 
and on the outskirts of the settlement, the explorer was met by Francisco 
Pizarro, an old friend who had accompanied him on his first crossing of 
the isthmus. But this was a trap: Leading one hundred soldiers, Pizarro 
surrounded his former friend, arrested hirn, and returned hirn to Pe­
drarias, who tried him on charges of rebellion. A few days later Balboa's 
head fell into a basket, along with those of his most trusted followers, 
Years later Pizarro hirnself reached Peru, and Balboa's deeds were for­
gotten. 
Interpretation 
Most men are ruled by the heart, not the head. Their plans are vague, and 
when they meet obstacles they improvis e. But improvisation will only 
bring you as far as the next crisis, and is never a substitute for thinking 
several steps ahead and planning to the end. 
Balboa had a dream of glory and wealth, and a vague plan to reach it. 
Yet his bold deeds, and his discovery of the Pacific, are largely forgotten, 
for he committed what in the world of power is the ultimate sin: He went 
part way, leaving the door open for others to take over. A real man of 
power would have had the prudence to see the dangers in the distance­
the rivals who would want to share in the conquests, the vultures that 
would hover once they heard the word "gol d." Balboa should have kept 
his knowledge of the Incas secret until after he had conquered Peru. Only 
then would his wealth, and his head, have been secure. Once Pedrarias ar­
rived on the scene, a man of power and prudence would have schemed to 
kill or imprison hirn, and to take over the army he had brought for the 
conquest of Peru. But Balboa was locked in the moment, always reacting 
emotionally, never thinking ahead. 
What good is it to have the greatest dream in the world if others reap 
the benefits and the glory ? Never lose your head over a vague, open­
ended dream-plan to the end. 
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 
In 1863 the Prussian premier Otto von Bismarck surveyed the chessboa rd 
of European power as it then stood. The main players were England, 
France, and Austria. Prussia itself was one of several states in the loosely 
allied German Federation. Austria, dominant member of the Federation, 
made sure that the other German states remained weak, divided and sub­
missive. Bismarck believed that Prussia was destined for something far 
greater than servant boy to Austria. 
This is how Bismarck played the game. His first move was to start a 
war with lowly Denmark, in order to recover the former Prussian lands of 
Schieswig-Hoistein. He knew that these rumblings of Prussian indepen­
dence might worry France and England, so he enlisted Austria in the war, 
claiming that he was recovering Schleswig-Hoistein for their benefit. In a 
few months, after the war was decided, Bismarck demanded that the 
newly conquered lands be made part of Prussia. The Austrians of course 
were furious, but they compromised: First they agreed to give the Prus­
sians Schleswig, and a year later they sold them Holstein. The world 
began to see that Austria was weakening and that Prussia was on the rise. 
Bismarck's next move was his boldest: In 1866 he convinced King 
William of Prussia to withdraw from the German Federation, and in doing 
so to go to war with Austria itself. King William's wife, his son the crown 
prince, and the princes of the other German kingdoms vehemently op­
posed such a war. But Bismarck, undaunted, succeeded in forcing the con­
flict, and Prussia's superior army defeated the Austrians in the brutally unaware of the fact that 
we should think weil 
before doing anything. 
But we are daily guilty 
ofnot remember ing, 
and the eonsequenees 
are evil. I very much 
value this dervish's 
advice. " 
The king decided to 
bear the adviee always 
in his mind, and com­
manded it to be written 
in gold on the walls 
and even engraved on 
his silver plate. 
Not long afterward a 
plotter desired to kill 
the king. He bribed the 
royal surgeon with a 
promise of the prime 
ministership if he thrust 
a poisoned laneet into 
the king's arm. When 
the time came to let 
some ofthe king's 
blood, a silver basin 
was placed to catch the 
blood. Suddenly the 
surgeon became aware 
ofthe words engraved 
upon it: "Never begin 
anything until you have 
rejteeted what will be 
the end of it." It was 
only then that he real­
ized that if the plotter 
became king he eould 
have the surgeon killed 
instantly, and would 
not need to fulfill his 
bargain. 
The king, seeing that 
the surgeon was now 
trembling, asked him 
what was wrimg with 
him. And so he 
eonfessed the truth, at 
that very moment . 
The plotter was seized; 
and the king sent for all 
the people who had 
been present when the 
abdal gave his adviee, 
and said to them: "Do 
you stililaugh at the 
dervish? "

240 LAW 29 short Seven Weeks War. The king and the Prussian generals then wanted 
to march on Vienna, taking as much land from Austria as possible. But 
Bismarck stopped them-now he presented himself as on the side of 
peace. The result was that he was able to conclude a treaty with Austria 
that granted Prussia and the other German states total autonomy. Bis­
marck could now position Prussia as the dominant power in Germany and 
the head of a newly formed North German Confederation. 
The French and the English began to compare Bismarck to Attila the 
Hun, and to fear that he had designs on all ofEurope. Once he had started 
on the path to conquest, there was no telling where he would stop. And, 
indeed, three years later Bismarck provoked a war with France. First he 
appeared to give his permission to France's annexation of Belgium, then 
at the last moment he changed his mind. Playing a cat-and-mouse garne, 
he infuriated the French emperor, Napoleon III, and stirred up his own 
king against the French. To no one's surprise, war broke out in 1870. The 
newly formed German federation enthusiastically joined in the war 
on France, and once again the Prussian military machine and its allies 
destroyed the enemy army in a matter of months. Although Bismarck 
opposed taking any French land, the generals convin ced him that Alsace­
Lorraine would become part of the federatio n. 
Now all of Europe feared the next move of the Prussian monster, led 
by Bismarck, the "lron Chancellor. " And in fact a year later Bismarck 
founded the German Empire, with the Prussian king as the newly 
crowned emperor and Bismarck himself a prince. But then something 
strange happened: Bismarck instigated no more wars. And while the other 
European powers grabbed up land for colonies in other continents, he se­
verely limited Germany 's colonial acquisiti ons. He did not want more 
land for Germany, but more security. For the rest of his life he struggled to 
maintain peace in Europe and to prevent further wars. Everybody as­
sumed he had change d, mellowing with the years. They had failed to un­
derstand: This was the final move of his original plan. 
Interpretation 
There is a simple reason why most men never know when to come off the 
attack: They form no concrete idea of their goal. Once they achieve vic­
tory they only hunger for more. To stop-to aim for a goal and then keep 
to it-seems almost inhuman, in fact; yet nothing is more critical to the 
maintenance of power. The person who goes too far in his triumphs cre­
ates areaction that inevitably leads to a decline. The only solution is to 
plan for the long run. Foresee the future with as much clarity as the gods 
on Mount Olympus, who look through the clouds and see the ends of all 
things. 
From the beginning of his career in politics, Bismarck had one goal: 
to form an independent German state led by Prussia. He inst igated the 
war with Denmark not to conquer territory but to stir up Prussian nation­
alism and unite the country. He incited the war with Austria only to gain 
Prussian independence. (This was why he refused to grab Austrian terri­
tory.) And he fomented the war with France to unite the German king­
doms against a common enemy, and thus to prepare for the formation of a 
united Germany. 
Once this was achieved, Bismarck stopped. He never let triumph go 
to his head, was never tempted by the siren call of more. He held the reins 
tightly, and whenever the generals, or the king, or the Prussian people de­
manded new conquests, he held them back. Nothing would spoil the 
beauty of his creation, certainly not a false euphoria that pushed those 
around hirn to attempt to go past the end that he had so carefully planned. 
Expenence shows that, if one foresees from far away the designs to be 
undertaken, one can act with speed when the moment comes to execute them. 
Cardinal Richelieu, 158 5-1642 
KEYS TO POWER 
According to the cosmology of the ancient Greeks, the gods were thought 
to have complete vision into the future. They saw everything to come, 
right down to the intricate detai ls. Men, on the other hand, were seen as 
victims of fate, trapped in the moment and their emotions, unable to see 
beyond immediate dangers. Those heroes, such as Odysseus, who were 
able to look beyond the present and plan several steps ahead, seemed to 
defy fate, to approximate the gods in their ability to determine the future. 
The comparison is still valid-those among us who think further ahead 
and patiently bring their plans to fruition seem to have a godlike power. 
Because most people are too imprisoned in the moment to plan with 
this kind of foresight, the ability to ignore immediate dangers and plea­
sures translates into power. It is the power of being able to overcome the 
natural human tendency to react to things as they happen, and instead to 
train oneself to step back, imagining the larger things taking shape beyond 
one's immediate vision. Most people believe that they are in fact aware of 
the future, that they are planning and thinking ahead. They are usually de­
luded: What they are really doing is succumbing to their desires, to what 
they want the future to be. Their plans are vague, based on their imagina­
tions rather than their reality. They may believe they are thinking all the 
way to the end, but they are really only focusing on the happy ending, and 
deluding themselves by the strength of their desire. 
In 415 B.C., the ancient Athenians attacked Sicily, believing their ex­
pedition would bring them riches, power, and a glorious ending to the six­
teen-year Peloponnesian War. They did not consider the dangers of an 
invasion so far from horne; they did not foresee that the Sicilians would 
fight all the harder since the battles were in their own homeland, or that 
all of Athens's enemies would band together against them, or that war 
would break out on several fronts, stretching their forces way too thin. 
The Sicilian expedition was a complete dis aster, leading to the destruction 
LAW 29 241 
242 LAW 29 of one of the greatest civilizations of all time. The Athenians were led into 
this disaster by their hearts, not their minds. They saw only the chance of 
glory, not the dangers that loomed in the dista nce. 
Cardinal de Retz, the sevente enth-century Frenchman who prided 
himself on his insights into human schemes and why they mostly fail, ana­
lyzed this phenomenon. In the course of arebellion he spearheaded 
against the French mona rchy in 1651, the young king, Louis XIV, and his 
court had suddenly left Paris and established themselves in a palace out­
side the capital. The presence of the king so dose to the heart of the revo­
lution had been a tremendous burden on the revolut iona ries, and they 
breathed a sigh of relief. This later proved their downfall, however, since 
the court' s absence from Paris gave it much more room to maneuver. 
"The most ordinary cause of people's mistake s," Cardinal de Retz later 
wrote, "is their being too much fright ened at the present danger, and not 
enough so at that which is remote ." 
The dangers that are remote, that 100m in the distance-if we can see 
them as they take shape, how many mistakes we avoid. How many plans 
we would instantly abort if we realized we were avoiding a small danger 
only to step into a larger one. So much of power is not what you do but 
what you do not do-the rash and foolish actions that you refrain from be­
fore they get you into trouble. Plan in detail be fore you act-do not let 
vague plans lead you into trouble . Will this have unin tended conse­
quences? Will I stir up new enemie s? Will someone else take advantage of 
my labors? Unhappy endings are much more common than happy 
ones-do not be swayed by the happy ending in your mind. 
The French elections of 1848 came down to a struggle between Louis­
Adolphe Thiers, the man of order, and General Louis Eugene Cavaignac, 
the rabble-rouser of the right. When Thiers realized he was hopelessly be­
hind in this high- stakes race, he searched desp erately for a solut ion. His 
eye fell on Louis Bona parte, grand- nephew ofthe great general Napoleon, 
and a lowly deputy in the parlia ment. This Bonap arte seemed a bit of an 
imbecile, but his name alone could get him elected in a country yearning 
for a strong ruler. He would be Thiers's puppet and event ually would be 
pushed offstage . The first part of the plan worked to perfection, and 
Napoleon was elected by a large margin. The problem was that Thiers 
had not foreseen one simple fact: This "imbecile" was in fact a man of 
enormous ambit ion. Three years later he dissolved parliament, dedared 
himself emperor, and ruled France for another eighteen years, much to 
the horror of Thiers and his party. 
The ending is everything. It is the end of the action that determines 
who gets the glory, the money, the prize. Your condusion must be crystal 
clear, and you must keep it constantly in mind. You must also figure out 
how to ward off the vultur es circling overhead, trying to live off the car­
cass of your creation. And you must anticipate the many possible crises 
that will tempt you to improv ise. Bismarck overcame these dangers be­
cause he plan ned to the end, kept on course through every crisis, and 
never let others steal the glory. Once he had reached his stated goal, he 
withdrew into his shelllike a turtle. This kind of self-control is godlike. 
When you see several steps ahead, and plan your moves all the way 
to the end, you will no longer be tempted by emotion or by the desire to 
improvise. Your elarity will rid you of the anxiety and vagueness that are 
the primary reasons why so many fail to conelude their actions success­
fully. You see the ending and you tolerate no deviation.

has its original vigor and drive. We must rather begin gently and 
eooUy, saving our breath for the eneounter and our vigorous thrusts 
for finishing off the job. In their beginnings it is we who guide affairs 
and hold them in our power; but so often onee they are set in motion, 
it is they which guide us and sweep us along. (Montaigne, 1533-1592)

244 LAW 29 REVERSAL 
It is a diche among strategists that your plan must indude alternatives and 
have a degree of flexibility. That is certainly true. If you are locked into a 
plan too rigidly, you will be unable to deal with sudden shifts of fortune. 
Once you have examined the future possibilities and decided on your tar­
get, you must build in alternatives and be open to new routes toward your 
goal. 
Most people, however, lose less from overplanning and rigidity than 
from vagueness and a tendency to improvise constantly in the face of cir­
cumstance. There is no real purpose in contemplating areversal to this 
Law, then, for no good can come from refusing to think far into the future 
and planning to the end. If you are dear-and far-thinking enough, you 
will understand that the future is uncertain, and that you must be open to 
adaptation. Only having a dear objective and a far-reaching plan allows 
you that freedom.

The Japanese tea ceremony called Cha-no-yu ("Hot Water for Tea") has 
origins in ancient times, but it reached its peak of refinement in the six­
teenth century under its most renowned practitioner, Sen no Rikyu. Al­
though not from a noble family, Rikyu rose to great power, becoming the 
preferred tea master of the Emperor Hideyoshi, and an important adviser 
on aesthetic and even political matters. For Rikyu, the secret of success 
consisted in appearing natural, concealing the effort behind one's work. 
One day Rikyu and his son went to an acquainta nce's house for a tea 
ceremony. On the way in, the son remarked that the lovely antique-Iook­
ing gate at their host's house gave it an evocatively lonely appeara nce. "I 
don't think so," replied his father, "it looks as though it had been brought 
from some mountain temple a long way off, and as if the labor required to 
import it must have cost a lot of money. " If the owner of the house had put 
this much effort into one gate, it would show in his tea ceremo ny-and in­
deed Sen no Rikyu had to leave the ceremony early, unable to endure the 
affeetation and effort it inadvertently revealed. 
On another evening, while having tea at a friend's house, Rikyu saw 
his host go outside, hold up alantern in the darkness, cut a lernon off a tree, 
and bring it in. This charmed Rikyu-the host needed a relish for the dish 
he was serving, and had spontaneously gone outside to get one. But when 
the man offered the lemon with some Osaka rice cake, Rikyu realized that 
he had planned the cutting of the lemon all along, to go with this expensive 
delicacy. The ge sture no longer seemed spontaneous-it was a way for the 
host to prove his cleverness. He had accidentally revealed how hard he 
was trying. Having seen enough, Rikyu politely declined the cake, excused 
hirnself, and left. 
Emperor Hideyoshi once planned to visit Rikyu for a tea ceremon y. 
On the night before he was to come, snow began to fall. Thinking quickly, 
Rikyu laid round cushions that fit exactly on each of the stepping-stones 
that led through the garden to his house. Just before dawn, he rose, saw 
that it had stopped snowing, and carefully removed the cushions. When 
Hideyoshi arrived, he marveled at the simple beauty of the sight-the per­
fectly round stepping stones, unencumbered by snow-and noticed how it 
called no attention to the manner in which Rikyu had accomplished it, but 
only to the polite gesture itself. 
After Sen no Rikyu died, his ideas had a profound influence on the 
practice of the tea ceremon y. The Tokugawa shogun Yorinobu, son of the 
great Emperor Ieyasu, was a student of Rikyu's teachings. In his garden he 
had a stone lantern made by a famous master, and Lord Sakai Tadakatsu 
asked if he could come by one day to see it. Yorinobu replied that he would 
be honored, and commanded his gardeners to put everything in order for 
the visit. These gardeners, unfamiliar with the precepts of Cha-no-yu, 
thought the stone lantern missha pen, its windows being too small for the 
present taste. They had a local workman enlarge the windows. A few days 
before Lord Sakai's visit, Yorinobu toured the garden. When he saw the al-
tered windows he exploded with rage, ready to impale on his sword the 
fool who had ruined the lantem, upsetting its natural grace and destroying 
the whole purpose of Lord Sakai's visit. 
When Yorinobu calmed down, however, he remembered that he had 
originally bought two of the lantems, and that the second was in his garden 
on the island of Kishu. At great expense, he hired a whale boat and the 
finest rowers he could find, ordering them to bring the lantem to hirn 
within two days-a difficult feat at best. But the sailors rowed day and 
night, and with the luck of a good wind they arrived just in time. To Yori­
nobu's delight, this stone lantem was more magnificent than the first, for it 
had stood untouched for twenty years in a bamboo thicket, acquiring a 
brilliant antique appearance and a delicate covering of moss. When Lord 
Sakai arrived, later that same day, he was awed by the lantem, which was 
more magnificent than he had imagined-so graceful and at one with the 
elements. Fortunately he had no idea what time and effort it had cost Yori­
nobu to create this sublime effect. 
Interpretation 
To Sen no Rikyu, the sudden appearance of something naturally, almost 
accidentally graceful was the height of beauty. This beauty came without 
warning and seemed effortless. Nature created such things by its own laws 
and processes, but men had to create their effects through labor and con­

OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW II 
The great escape artist Harry Houdini once advertised his aet as "The Im­
possible Possible ." And indeed those who witnessed his dramatic escapes 
feIt that what he did onstage contradicted commonsense ideas of human 
capacity. 
One evening in 1904, an audience of 4,000 Londoners filled a theater 
to watch Houdini accept achalienge: to escape from a pair of manacles 
billed as the strongest ever invented. They contained six sets of locks and 
nine tumbiers in each cuff; a Birmingham maker had spent five years con­
structing them. Experts who examined them said they had never seen any­
thing so intricate, and this intricacy was thought to make them impossible 
to escape. 
The crowd watched the experts secure the manacles on Houdini's 
wrists. Then the escape artist entered a black cabinet on stage. The minutes swallows over willow 
trees. When Masamune 
saw the finished work 
he was as overjoyed at 
the artist's skill as he 
had previously been 
annoyed at the appar­
ent mess he was 
making of the screens.

There was once a 
wrestling master who 
was versal in 360 feints 
and holds. He took a 
specialliking tu one of 
his pupils, to whom he 
taught 359 of them over 
aperiod of time. Some­
how he never got 
around tu the tast trick. 
As months went by the 
young man became so 
profiäent in the art that 
he bested everyone who 
dared to face him in the 
ring. He was so proud 
of his prowess that one 
day he boasted berore 
the sultan that he could 
readily whip his master, 
were it not out of 
respect for his age and 
gratitude for his 
tutetage. 
The sultan became 
incensed at this irre ver­
ence and ordered an 
immediate match wäh 
the royal court in 
attendance. 
At the gong fhe youth 
barged forward with a 
tusty yell, only to be

The master seized his 
former pupil, lifted hirn 
high above his head, 
and jlung hirn crashing 
to the ground. The 
sultan and the assem-

When the sultan asked 
the master how he was 
able to overcome such 
a strong opponent, the 
master confessed that 
he had reserved a secret 
technique for hirnself 
for just such a contin­
gency. Then he related 
the lamentation of a 
master of archery, who 
taught everything he 
knew. "No one has 
learned archery fram 
me," the poor fellow 
complained, "who has 
not tried to use me as a

AS TOLD IN 
THE CRAF T OF POWER,

248 LAW 30 went by; the more time passed, the more certain it seemed that these man­
aeles would be the first to defeat him. At one point he emerged from the 
cabinet, and asked that the cuffs be temporarily removed so that he could 
take off his coat-it was hot inside. The challengers refused, suspecting his 
request was a trick to find out how the locks worked. Undeterred, and with­
out using his hands, Houdini managed to lift the coat over his shoulders, 
turn it inside out, remove a penknife from his vest pocket with his teeth, 
and, by moving his head, cut the coat off his arms. Freed from the coat, he 
stepped back into the cabinet, the audience roaring with approval at his 
grace and dexterity. 
Finally, having kept the audience waiting long enough, Houdini 
emerged from the cabinet a second time, now with his hands free, the man­
aeles raised high in triumph. To this day no one knows how he managed 
the escape. Although he had taken elose to an hour to free himself, he had 
never looked concerned, had shown no sign of doubt. Indeed it seemed by 
the end that he had drawn out the escape as a way to heighten the drama, 
to make the audience worry-for there was no other sign that the perfor­
mance had been anything but easy. The complaint ab out the heat was 
equally part of the act. The spectators of this and other Houdini perfor­
mances must have feit he was toying with them: These manaeles are noth­
ing, he seemed to say, I could have freed myself a lot sooner, and from a 
lot worse. 
Over the years, Houdini escaped from the chained carcass of an em­
balmed "sea monster" (a half octopus, half whalelike beast that had 
beached near Boston); he had himself sealed inside an enormous envelope 
from which he emerged without breaking the paper; he passed through 
brick walls; he wriggled free from strailjackets while dangling high in the 
air; he leaped from bridges into icy waters, his hands manaeled and his legs 
in chains; he had himself submerged in glass cases full ofwater, hands pad­
locked, while the audience watched in amazement as he worked himself 
free, struggling for elose to an hour apparently without breathing. Each 
time he seemed to court certain death yet survived with superhuman 
aplomb. Meanwhile, he said nothing about his methods, gave no elues as 
to how he accompli shed any of his tricks-he left his audiences and critics 
speculating, his power and reputation enhanced by their struggles with the 
inexplica ble, Perhaps the most baffling trick of all was making a ten-thou­
sand-pound elephant disappear before an audience's eyes, a feat he re­
peated on stage for over nineteen weeks. No one has ever really explained 
how he did this, for in the auditorium where he performed the trick, there 
was simply nowhere for an elephant to hide. 
The effortlessness of Houdini's escapes led some to think he used oc­
cuIt forces, his superior psychic abilities giving him special control over his 
body. But a German escape artist named Kleppini elaimed to know Hou­
dini's secret: He simply used elaborate gadgets, Kleppini also elaimed to 
have defeated Houdini in a handcuff challenge in Holland. 
Houdini did not mind all kinds of speculation floating around ab out 
his methods, but he would not tolerate an outright lie, and in 1902 he ehal­
lenged Kleppini to a handeuff duel. Kleppini aeeepted. Through a spy, he 
found out the seeret word to unloek a pair of Freneh eombinati on-loek 
cuffs that Houdini liked to use. His plan was to ehoose these euffs to eseape 
from onstage . This would definitively debunk Houdini-his "genius" sim­
ply lay in his use of meehanieal gadgets. 
On the night of the ehallenge, just as Kleppini had planned, Houdini 
offered hirn a ehoice of euffs and he seleeted the ones with the eombination 
lock. He was even able to disappear with them behind a sereen to make a 
quick test, and reemerged seeonds later, eonfident of vietory. 
Aeting as if he sensed fraud, Houdini refused to loek Kleppini in the 
cuffs. The two men argued and began to fight, even wrestling with each 
other onstage . Mter a few minutes of this, an apparently angry, frustrated 
Houdini gave up and loeked Kleppini in the euffs. For the next few minutes 
Kleppini strained to get free. Something was wrong-min utes earlier he 
had opened the euffs behind the sereen; now the same eode no longer 
worked. He sweated, raeking his brains. Hours went by, the audienee left, 
and finally an exhausted and humiliated Kleppini gave up and asked to be 
released. 
The euffs that Kleppini hirnself had opened behind the sereen with the 
word "C-L-E-F-S" (Freneh for "keys") now clieked open only with the 
word "F-R-A-U-D. "Kleppini never figured out how Houdini had aecom­
plished this uneanny feat. 
Interpretation 
Although we do not know for eertain how Houdini aeeomplished many of 
his most ingenious eseapes, one thing is clear: It was not the oeeult, or any 
kind of magie, that gave him his powers, but hard work and endless prae­
tice, all of whieh he earefully eoneealed from the world. Houdini never left 
anything to ehanee-day and night he studied the workings of locks, re­
searehed eenturies-old sleight-of-hand tricks, pored over books on meehan­
ics, whatever he eould use. Every moment not spent researehing he spent 
working his body, keeping hirnself exeeptionally limber, and learning how 
to eontrol his muscles and his breathing. 
Early on in Houdini's eareer, an old Japanese performer whom he 
toured with taught hirn an ancient trick: how to swallow an ivory ball, then 
bring it baek up. He practieed this endlessly with a small peeled potato tied 
to a string-up and down he would manipulate the potato with his throat 
muscles, until they were strong enough to move it without the string. The 
organizers of the London handeuff challenge had searehed Houdin i's body 
thoroughly beforehand, but no one eould cheek the inside of his throat, 
where he eould have eoneealed small tools to help hirn eseape. Even so, 
Kleppini was fundamentally wrong: It was not Houdin i's tools but his prae­
tiee, work, and research that made his eseapes possible. 
Kleppini, in fact, was eompletely outwitted by Houdini, who set the 
whole thing up. He let his opponent learn the eode to the Freneh euffs, Keep the extent 01 your 
abilities unknown. The 
wise man does not 
allow his knowledge 
and abilWes to be 
sounded to the bottom, 
il he desires to be 
honored by all. He 
allows you to know 
them but not to 
comprehend them. No 
one must know the 
extent 01 his abilities, 
lest he be disappointed. 
No one ever has an

about the extent 01 his

veneration than accu­
rate knowledge 01 
them, be they ever so 
great.

250 LAW 30 then baited hirn into choosing those cuffs onstage. Then, during the two 
men's tussle, the dexterous Houdini was able to change the code to ''F-R­
A-U-D." He had spent weeks practicing this trick, but the audience saw 
none of the sweat and toil behind the scenes. Nor was Houdini ever ner­
vous; he induced nervousness in others. (He deliberately dragged out the 
time it would take to escape, as a way of heightening the drama, and mak­
ing the audience squirm.) His escapes from death, always graceful and 
easy, made hirn look like a superman. 
As a person of power, you must research and practice endlessly before 
appearing in public, onstage or anywhere else. Never expose the sweat and 
labor behind your poise. Some think such exposure will demonstrate their 
diligence and honesty, but it actually just makes them look weaker-as if 
anyone who practiced and worked at it could do what they had done, or as 
if they weren't really up to the job. Keep your effort and your tricks to 
yourself and you seem to have the grace and ease of a god. One never sees 
the source of a god's power revea led; one only sees its effects.

KEYS TO POWER 
Humanity's first notions of power came from primitive encounters with na­
ture-the flash of lightning in the sky, a sudden flood, the speed and feroc­
ity of a wild animal. These forces required no thinking, no planning-they 
awed us by their sudden appearance, their gracefuln ess, and their power 
over life and death. And this remains the kind of power we have always 
wanted to imitate. Through science and technology we have re-created the 
speed and sublime power of nature, but something is missing: Our ma­
chines are noisy and jerky, they reveal their effort. Even the very best cre­
ations of technology cannot root out our admiration for things that move 
easily and effortlessly. The power of children to bend us to their will comes 
from a kind of seductive charm that we feel in the presence of a creature 
less reflective and more graceful than we are. We cannot return to such a 
state, but if we can create the appearance of this kind of ease, we elicit in 
others the kind of primitive awe that nature has always evoked in hu­
·mankind. 
One of the first European writers to expound on this principle came 
from that most unnatural of environments, the Renaissance court. In 17ze 
Book of the Courtier, published in 1528, Baldassare Castiglione describes the 
highly elaborate and codified manners of the perfect court citizen. And yet, 
Castiglione explains, the courtier must execute these gestures with what he 
calls spre;zatura, the capacity to make the difficult seem easy. He urges the 
courtier to "practice in all things a certain nonchalance which conceals all 
artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effort­
less." We all admire the ach ievement of some unusual feat, but if it is ac­
complished naturally and gracefully, our admiration increases tenfold­
"whereas . . . to labor at what one is doing and . . . to make bones over it, 
shows an extreme lack of grace and causes everything, whatever its worth, 
to be discounte d." 
Much of the idea of sprezzatura came from the world of art. All the 
great Renaissance artists carefully kept their works under wrap s. Only the 
finished master piece could be shown to the public. Michelangelo forbade 
even popes to view his work in process. A Rena issance artist was always 
careful to keep his studios shut to patrons and public alike, not out of fear 
of imitati on, but because to see the making of the works would mar the 
magic of their effect, and their studied atrno sphere of ease and natural 
beauty. 
The Rena issance painter Vasari, also the first great art critic, ridiculed 
the work of Paolo Uccello, who was obsessed with the laws of perspect ive. 
The effo rt Uccello spent on improving the appearance of perspect ive was 
too obvious in his work-it made his paintings ugly and labored, over­
whelmed by the effort of their effects. We have the same response when we 
watch perform ers who put too much effo rt into their act: Seeing them try­
ing so hard breaks the illusion. 1t also makes us unco mfortabl e. Calm, 
grac eful perf ormers, on the other hand, set us at ease, creating the illusion 
that they are not acting but being natural and themselves, even when 
everything they are doing involves labor and practice. 
The idea of sprezzatura is relevant to all forms of power, for power 
depends vitally on appeara nces and the illusions you create. Your public 
actions are like artwo rks: They must have visual appeal, must create antici­
pation, even enterta in. When you reveal the inner workings of your cre­
ation, you become just one more morta1 among others . What is 
understandable is not awe-inspiri ng-we tell ourselves we could do as well 
if we had the money and time. Avoid the temptation of showing how 
clever you are-it is far more clever to conceal the mechanisms of your 
cleve rness. 
Talleyra nd's applicat ion of this concept to his daily life greatly en­
hanced the aura of power that surrounded him. He never liked to work too 
hard, so he made others do the work for him-the spying, the research, the 
detailed ana lyses. With all this labor at his disposal, he hirnself never 
seemed to strain. When his spies revealed that a certain event was about to 
take place, he would talk in social conversation as if he sensed its immi­
nence. The result was that people thought he was clairvoya nt. His short 
pithy statements and wit ticisms always seemed to summarize a situat ion 
perf ectly, but they were based on much research and thought. To those in 
government, including Napoleon hirnse lf, Talleyrand gave the impre ssion 
of immense pow er-an effect entirely dependent on the apparent ease 
with which he accomplished his feats. 
There is another reason for concea ling your shortcuts and tricks : 
LAW 30 251 
252 LAW 30 When you let this information out, you give people ideas they can use 
against you. You lose the advantages of keeping silent. We tend to want the 
world to know what we have done--we want our vanity gratified by hav­
ing OUf hard work and cleverness applauded, and we may even want sym­
pathy for the hOUfS it has taken to reach OUf point of artistry. Learn to 
control this propensity to blab, for its effect is often the opposite of what 
you expected. Remember: The more mystery surrounds YOUf actions, the 
more awesome your power seems. You appear to be the only one who can 
do what you do-and the appearance of having an exclusive gift is im­
mensely powernd. Finally, because you achieve YOUf accomplis hments 
with grace and ease, people believe that you could always do more if you 
tried harder. This elicits not only admiration but a touch of fear. YOUf pow­
ers are untapped-no one can fathom their limits. 
Image: The Racehorse. From up close we would see the 
strain, the effort to control the horse, the labored, painful 
breathing. But from the distance where we sit and watch, it 
is all gracefulness, flying through the air. Keep others at a 
distance and they will only see the ease with which you move. 
Authority: For whatever action [nonchalance] accompan ies, no 
matter how trivial it is, it not only reveals the skill of the person 
doing it but also very often ca uses it to be considered far greater 
than it really iso This is because it makes the onlookers believe that 
a man who performs weIl with so much facility must possess even 
greater skill than he does. (Baldassare Castiglione, 1478-1529) 
REVERSAL 
The secrecy with which you surround YOUf actions must seem lighthearted 
in spirit. A zeal to conceal YOUf work creates an unpleasant, almost para­
noiac impression: you are taking the game too seriously. Houdini was care­
ful to make the concealment of his tricks seem agame, all part of the show. 
Never show YOUf work until it is finished, but if you put too much effort 
into keeping it under wraps you will be like the painter Pontormo, who 
spent the last years of his life hiding his frescoes from the public eye and 
only succeeded in driving hirnself mad. Always keep your sense of humor 
about yourself. 
There are also times when revealing the inner workings of your pro­
jects can prove worthwh ile. It all depends on YOUf audience's taste, and on 
the times in which you operate. P. T. Barnum recognized that his public 
wanted to feel involved in his shows, and that understanding his tricks de­
lighted them, partly, perhaps, because implicitly debunking people who 
kept their sources of power hidden from the masses appealed to America' s 
democratic spirit. The public also appreciated the showma n's humor and 
honesty. Bamum took this to the extreme of publicizing his own humbug­
gery in his popular autobiogra phy, written when his career was at its 
height. 
As long as the partial disclosure of tricks and techniq ues is carefully 
planned, rather than the result of an uncontrollable need to blab, it is the 
ultimate in cleverne ss. It gives the audience the illusion of being superior 
and involved, even while much of what you do remains concealed from 
them.

OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW I 
From early in his reign, Ivan IV, later known as Ivan the Terrible, had to 
confront an unpleasant reality: The country desperately needed reform, 
but he lacked the power to push it through. The greatest limit to his author­
ity came from the boyars, the Russian princely dass that domina ted the 
country and terrorized the peasantry. 
In 1553, at the age of twenty-three, Ivan fell ill. Lying in bed, nearing 
death, he asked the boyars to swear allegiance to his son as the new czar. 
Some hesitate d, some even refused. Then and there Ivan saw he had no 
power over the boyars. He recovered from his illness, but he never forgot 
the lesson: The boyars were out to destroy hirn. And indeed in the years to 
corne, many of the most powerful of them defected to Russia's main ene­
mies, Poland and Lithuania, where they plotted their return and the over­
throw of the czar. Even one of Ivan's dosest friends, Prince Andrey 
Kurbski, suddenly turned against hirn, defecting to Lithuania in 1564, and 
becoming the strongest of Ivan's enemies. 
When Kurbski began raising troops for an invasion, the royal dynasty 
seerned suddenly more precarious than ever. With emigre nobles foment­
ing invasion from the west, Tartars bearing down from the east, and the bo­
yars stirring up trouble within the country, Russia's vast size made it a 
nightmare to defend. In whatever direction Ivan struck, he would leave 
hirnself vulnerable on the other side. Only if he had absolute power could 
he deal with this many-headed Hydra. And he had no such power. 
Ivan brooded until the morning of December 3, 1564, when the citi­
zens of Moscow awoke to a strange sight. Hundreds of sleds filled the 
square before the Kremlin, loaded with the czar's treasures and with provi­
sions for the entire court. They watched in disbelief as the czar and his 
court boarded the sleds and left town. Without explaining why, he estab­
lished hirnself in a village south of Moscow. For an entire month a kind of 
terror gripped the capital, for the Muscovites feared that Ivan had aban­
doned them to the bloodthirsty boyars. Shops closed up and riotous mobs 
gathered daily. Finally, on January 3 of 1565, a letter arrived from the czar, 
explaining that he could no longer bear the boyars' betrayals and had de­
cided to abdicate once and for all. 
Read aloud in public, the letter had a startling effect: Merchants and 
commoners blamed the boyars for Ivan's decision, and took to the streets, 
terrifying the nobility with their fury. Soon a group of delegates represent­
ing the church, the princes, and the people made the joumey to Ivan's vil­
lage, and begged the czar, in the name of the holy land of Russia, to return 
to the throne. Ivan listened but would not change his mind. After days of 
hearing their pleas, however, he offered his subjects a choice: Either they 
grant hirn absolute powers to govern as he pleased, with no interference 
frorn the boyars, or they find a new leader. 
Faced with a choice between civil war and the acceptance of despotie 
power, almost every sector of Russian society "opted" for a strong czar, 
calling for Ivan's return to Moscow and the restoration oflaw and order. In The German Chancel­
lor Bismarck. enraged 
at the constant criti­
cisms from Rudolf 
Virchow (the German 
pathologist ami liberal 
politician ), had his 
seconds call upon the 
scientist to chal/enge 
him to a duel. "As the 
challenged party, I have 
the choice of weapons, " 
said Virchow, "and I 
choose these." He held 
aloft two large and 
apparently identical 
sausages. "One of 
these," he went on, "is 
infected with deadly 
germs; the other is 
perfectly sound. Let 
His Excellency decide 
which one he wishes to 
eat. and I will eat the 
other." Almost immedi­
ately the message came 
back that the chancel­
lor had decided to 
cancel the duel.

Interpretation 
Ivan the Terrible faced a terrible dilemma: To give in to the boyars would 
lead to certain destruction, but civil war would bring a different kind of 
ruin. Even if Ivall came out of such a war on top, the country would be dev­
astated and its divisions would be stronger than ever. His weapon of choice 
in the past had been to make a bold, offensive move. Now, however, that 
kind of move would turn against him-the more boldly he confronted his 
enemies, the worse the reactions he would spark 
The main weakness of a show of force is that it stirs up resentment and 
eventually leads to a response that eats at your authority_ Ivan, immensely 
creative in the use of power, saw clearly that the only path to the kind of 
victory he wanted was a false withdrawal. He would not force the country 
over to his position, he would give it "options": either his abdication, and 
certain anarchy, or his accession to absolute power. To back up his move, 
he made it clear that he preferred to abdicate: "Call my bluff," he said, 
"and watch what happens." No one called his bluff. By withdrawing for just 
a month, he showed the country a glimpse of the nightmares that would 
follow his abdication-Tartar invasions, civil war, ruin. (All of these did 
eventually come to pass after Ivan's death, in the infamous "Time of the 
Troubles.") 
Withdrawal and disappearance are classic ways of controlling the op­
tions. You give people a sense ofhow things will fall apart without you, and 
you offer them a "choice": I stay away and you suffer the consequences, or 
I return under circumstanc es that I dictate. In this method of controlling 
people's options, they choose the option that gives you power because the 
alternative is just too unpleasant. You force their hand, but indirectly : They 
seem to have a choice. Whenever people feel they have a choice, they walk 
into your trap that much more easily. 
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 11 
As a seventeenth-century French courtesan, Ninon de Lenclos found that 
her life had certain pleasures. Her lovers came from royalty and aristoc­
racy, and they paid her well, entertained her with their wit and intellect, 
satisfied her rather demanding sensual needs, and treated her almost as an 
equal. Such a life was infinitely preferable to marriage. In 1643, however, 
Ninon's mother died suddenly, leaving her, at the age of twenty-three, to­
tally alone in the world-no family, no dowry, nothing to fall back upon. A 
kind of panic overtook her and she entered a convent, turning her back on 
her illustrious lovers. A year later she left the convent and moved to Lyons. 
When she finally reappeared in Paris, in 1648, lovers and suitors flocked to 
her dOOf in greater numbers than ever before, for she was the wittiest and 
most spirited courtesan of the time and her presence had been greatly 
missed. 
Ninon's foHowers quickly discovered, however, that she had changed 
her old way of doing things, and had set up a new system of options. The 
dukes, seigneurs, and princes who wanted to pay for her serv ices could 
cont inue to do so, but they were no longer in control-she would sleep 
with them when she wante d, according to her whim. All their money 
bought them was a possi bility. If it was her pleasure to sleep with them only 
onee a month, so be it. 
Those who did not want to be what Ninon called a payeur could join 
the large and growing group of men she caHed her martyr.f-men who vis­
ited her apartment principally for her friendship, her biting wit, her lute­
playing, and the company of the most vibrant minds of the period, 
including Moliere, La Rochef oucauld, and Saint-Evremond. The martyrs, 
too, however, enterta ined a poss ibility : She would regularly select from 
them a favori, a man who would become her lover without having to pay, 
and to whom she would aban don herself completely for as long as she so 
desi red-a week, a few mont hs, rarely longer. A payeur could not become a 
fovori, but a martyr had no guarantee of becoming one, and indeed could 
remain disappointed for an entire lifetime. The poet Charleval, for exam­
pIe, never enjoyed Ninon's favors, but never stopped coming to visit -he 
did not want to do without her compa ny. 
As word of this system reached polite French society, Ninon became 
the object of intense host ility. Her reversal of the position of the courtesan 
scanda lized the queen mother and her court. Much to their horror, how­
ever, it did not dis courage her male suitors- indeed it only increased their 
numbers and intensified their desire. It became an honor to be a payeur, 
helping Ninon to maintain her lifestyle and her glittering salon, accompa­
nying her sometime s to the theater, and sleeping with her when she chose. 
Even more distingui shed were the martyrs, enjoying her compa ny without 
paying for it and maintaining the hope, however remote, of some day be­
coming her favori. That pos sibility spurred on many a young nobleman, as 
word spread that none among the courtesans eould surpass Ninon in the 
art of love. And so the married and the sing le, the old and the young, en­
tered her web and chose one of the two options presented to them, both of 
which amply satisfied her. 
Interpretation 
The life of the courtesan entailed the pos sibility of apower that was denied 
a marri ed woman, but it also had obvious perils. The man who paid for the 
courte san's serv ices in essence owned her, determining when he could pos­
sess her and when, later on, he would abandon her. As she grew older, her 
options narrowed, as fewer men chose her. To avoid a life of poverty she 
had to amass her fortune while she was young. The courte sa n's legendary 
greed, then, reflected a practical neces sity, yet also lessened her aHure, 
sinee the illusion of being desired is important to men, who are often alien-dered. "Surely you 
remember? You owe 
me a pot ofgold, and 1 
have come to 
collect it." 
"You are aperfeet har, 
sir!" exclaimed the 
king. "1 owe you no 
money!" 
"A perfect liar, am I?" 
said the poor man. 
"Then give me the 
golden apple!" 
The king, realizing that 
the man was trying to 
trick him, started to 
hedge. 
"No, not You are not a 
liarf" 
"Then give me the pot 
of gold you owe me, 
sire, " said the man. 
The king saw the 
dilemma. He handed 
over the golden apple.

258 LAW 31 ated if their partner is too interested in their money. As the courtesan aged, 
then, she faced a most difficult fate. 
Ninon de Lenclos had a horror of any kind of dependence. She early 
on tasted a kind of equality with her lovers, and she would not settle into a 
system that left her such distasteful options. Strangely enough, the system 
she devised in its place seemed to satisfy her suitors as much as it did her. 
The payeurs may have had to pay, but the fact that Ninon would only sleep 
with them when she wanted to gave them a thrill unavailable with every 
other courtesan : She was yielding out of her own desire. The martyrs' 
avoidance of the taint of having to pay gave them a sense of superiority; as 
members of Ninon's fraternity of admirers, they also might some day expe­
rience the ultimate pleasure of being her favori. Finally, Ninon did not 
force her suitors into either category. They could "choose" which side they 
preferred-a freedom that left them a vestige of masculine pride. 
Such is the power of giving people a choice, or rather the illusion of 
one, for they are playing with cards you have dealt them. Where the alter­
natives set up by Ivan the Terrible involved a certain risk-one option 
would have led to his losing his power-Ninon created a situation in which 
every option redounded to her favor. From the payeurs she received the 
money she needed to run her salon. And from the martyrs she gained the 
ultimate in power: She could surround herself with a bevy of admirers, a 
harem from which to choose her lovers. 
The system, though, depended on one critical factor: the possibility, 
however remote, that a martyr could become a favori. The illusion that 
riches, glory, or sensual satisfaction may someday fall into your victim's lap 
is an irresistible carrot to include in your list of choices. That hope, how­
ever slim, will make men accept the most ridicul ous situations, because it 
leaves them the all-important option of a dream. The illusion of choice, 
married to the possibility of future good fortune, will lure the most stub­
born sucker into your glittering web. 
KEYS TO POWER 
Words like "freedom," "options," and "choice" evoke apower of possibility 
far beyond the reality of the benefits they entail. When examined closely, 
the choices we have-in the market place, in elections, in our jobs-tend to 
have noticeable limitations: They are often a matter of a choice simply be­
tween A and B, with the rest of the alphabet out of the pieture. Yet as long 
as the faintest mirage of choice flickers on, we rarely focus on the missing 
options. We "choose" to believe that the game is fair, and that we have our 
freedom. We prefer not to think too much about the depth of our liberty to 
choose. 
This unwillingn ess to probe the smallness of our choices sterns from 
the fact that too much freedom creates a kind of anxiety. The phrase "un­
limited options" sounds infinitely promising, but unlimited options would 
actually paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose. Our limited range of 
choices comforts uso 
This supplie s the clever and cunning with enormous opportunities for 
deception. For people who are choosing between alternativ es find it hard 
to believe they are being manipulated or deceived; they cannot see that 
you are allowing them a small amount of free will in exchange for a much 
more powerful imposition of your own will. Setting up a narrow range of 
choices, then, should always be a part of your deceptions. There is a say­
ing: If you can get the bird to walk into the cage on its own, it will sing that 
much more prettily. 
The following are among the most common forms of "controlling the 
options": 
Color the Choices. This was a favored technique of Henry Kissinger. As 
President Richard Nixon's secretary of state, Kissinger considered hirnself 
better informed than his boss, and believed that in most situations he could 
make the best decision on his own. But if he tried to determine policy, he 
would offend or perhaps enrage a notoriously insecure man. So Kissinger 
would propose three or four choices of action for each situation, and would 
present them in such a way that the one he preferred always seemed the 
best solution compared to the others. Time after time, Nixon fell for the 
bait, never suspecting that he was moving where Kissinger pushed hirn. 
This is an excellent device to use on the insecure master. 
Force the Resister . One of the main problems faced by Dr. Milton H. Er­
ickson, a pioneer of hypnosis therapy in the 1950s, was the relapse. His pa­
tients might seem to be recovering rapidly, but their apparent suscept ibility 
to the therapy masked a deep resistance: They would soon relapse into old 
habits, blame the doctor, and stop coming to see hirn. To avoid this, Erick­
son began ordering some patients to have a relapse, to make themselves feel 
as bad as when they first came in-to go back to square one. Faced with 
this option, the patients would usually "choose" to avoid the relapse­
which, of course, was what Ericks on really wanted. 
This is a good technique to use on children and other willful people 
who enjoy doing the opposite of what you ask them to: Push them to 
"choose" what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite. 
Alter the Playing Field. In the 1860s, John D. Rockefeller set out to cre­
ate an oil monopoly. If he tried to buy up the smaller oil companies they 
would figure out what he was doing and fight back. Instead, he began se­
cretly buying up the railway companies that transported the oil. When he 
then attempted to take over a particular company, and met with resistance, 
he reminded them of their dependence on the rails. Refusing them ship­
ping, or simply raising their fees, could ruin their business. Rockefeller al­
tered the playing field so that the only options the small oil producers had 
were the ones he gave them. 
In this tactic your opponents know their hand is being forced, but it 
doesn't matter. The technique is effective against those who resist at all 
costs. 
LAW 31 259 
260 LAW 31 The Shrinking Options. The late-nineteent h-century art dealer Am­
broise Vollard perfected this technique. 
Customers would come to Vollard's shop to see some Cezannes. He 
would show three paintings, neglect to mention a price, and pretend to 
doze off. The visitors would have to leave without deciding. They would 
usually come back the next day to see the paintings again, but this time 
Vollard would pull out less interesting works, pretending he thought they 
were the same ones. The baffled customers would look at the new offer­
ings, leave to think them over, and return yet again. Once again the same 
thing would happen: Vollard would show paintings of lesser quality still. Fi­
nally the buyers would realize they had better grab what he was showing 
them, because tomorrow they would have to settle far something worse, 
perhaps at even higher prices. 
A variation on this technique is to raise the price every time the buyer 
hesitates and another day goes by. This is an excellent negotiating ploy to 
use on the chronically indecisive, who will fall for the idea that they are get­
ting a better deal today than if they wait till tomorrow. 
The We ak Man on the Precip ice. The weak are the easiest to maneuver 
by controlling their options. Cardinal de Retz, the great seventeenth-cen­
tury provocateur, served as an unofficial assistant to the Duke of Orleans, 
who was notoriously indecisive. It was a constant struggle to convince the 
duke to take action-he would hem and haw, weigh the options, and wait 
till the last moment, giving everyone around hirn an ulcer. But Retz discov­
ered a way to handle hirn: He would describe all sorts of dangers, exagger­
ating them as much as possible, until the duke saw a yawning abyss in 
every direction except one: the one Retz was pushing hirn to take. 
This tactic is similar to "Color the Choices," but with the weak you 
have to be more aggressive. Work on their emotions- use fear and terror 
to propel them into action. Try reason and they will always find a way to 
procrastinate. 
Brothers in Crime. This is a classic con-artist technique: You attract YOUf 
victims to same criminal scheme, creating a bond of blood and guilt be­
tween you. They participate in your deception, commit a crime (or think 
they do-see the story of Sam Geezil in Law 3), and are easily manipu­
lated. Serge Stavisky, the great French con artist of the 1920s, so entangled 
the government in his scams and swindles that the state did not dare to 
prosecute hirn, and "chose" to leave hirn alone. It is often wise to implicate 
in your deceptions the very person who can do you the most harm if you 
fail. Their involvement can be subtle--even a hint of their involvement 
will narrow their options and buy their silence. 
The Horns of a Dilemma. This idea was demonstrated by General 
William Sherman's infamous march through Georgia during the American 
Civil War. Although the Confederates knew what direction Sherman was 
heading in, they never knew if he would attack from the left or the right, for 
he divided his army into two wings--- and if the rebels retreated from one 
wing they found themselves facing the other. This is a classic triallawyer's 
technique: The lawyer leads the witnesses to decide between two possible 
explanati ons of an event, both of which poke a hole in their story. They 
have to answer the lawyer's questions, but whatever they say they hurt 
themselves. The key to this move is to strike quick ly: Deny the victim the 
time to think of an escape. As they wriggle between the horns of the 
dilemma, they dig their own grave. 
Understa nd: In your struggles with your rivals, it will often be necessary 
for you to hurt them. And if you are clearly the agent of their punishment, 
expect a counte rattack-e xpect revenge. If, however, they seem to them­
selves to be the agents of their own misfortune, they will submit quietly. 
When Ivan left Moscow for his rural village, the citizens asking hirn to re­
turn agreed to his demand for absolute power. Over the years to come, 
they resented hirn less for the terror he unleashed on the country, because, 
after all, they had granted hirn his power themselves. This is why it is al­
ways good to allow your victims their choice of poison, and to cloak your 
involvement in providing it to them as far as possible.

Authority: For the wounds and every other evil that men inflict upon them­

painful than those inflicted by others. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527) 
LAW 31 261 
262 LAW 31 REVERSAL 
Controlling the options has one main purpose: to disguise yourself as the 
agent of power and punishment. The tactic works best, then, for those 
whose power is fragile, and who cannot operate too openly without incur­
ring suspicion, resentment, and anger. Even as a general rule, however, it is 
rarely wise to be seen as exerting power directly and forcefully, no matter 
how secure or strong you are. 1t is usually more elegant and more effective 
to give people the illusion of choice. 
On the other hand, by limiting other people's options you sometimes 
limit your OWll. There are situations in which it is to your advantage to 
allow your rivals a large degree of freedom: As you watch them operate, 
you give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather informati on, and plan 
your deceptions. The nineteenth-century banker James Rothschild liked 
this method: He feIt that if he tried to control his opponents' movements, 
he lost the chance to observe their strategy and plan a more effective 
course. The more freedom he allowed them in the short term, the more 
forcefully he could act against them in the long run.

The city-state ofVenice was prosperous for so long that its citizens feIt their 
small republic had destiny on its side. In the Middle Ages and High Re­
naissance, its virtual monopoly on trade to the east made it the wealthiest 
city in Europe. Under a beneficent republican government, Venetians en­
joyed liberties that few other Italians had ever known. Yet in the sixteenth 
century their fortunes suddenly change d. The opening of the New Wo rld 
transf erred power to the Atlantic side of Europe-to the Spanish and Por­
tugu ese, and later the Dutch and Engli sh. Venice could not compete eco­
nomically and its empire gradually dwind led. The final blow was the 
devastating loss of a prized Mediterranean poss ession, the island of 
Cypr us, captured from Venice by the Turks in 1570. 
Now noble familie s went broke in Venice, and banks began to fold. A 
kind of gloom and depression settled over the citizens. They had known a 
glittering past-had either lived through it or heard stories about it frorn 
their elders. The closeness of the glory years was humiliating. The Vene­
tians half believed that the goddess Fortune was only playing a joke on 
them, and that the old days would soon return . For the time being, though, 
what could they do? 
In 1589 rumors began to swirl around Venice of the arrival not far 
away of a mysterious man called "11 Bragadin o," a master of alchemy, a 
man who had won incredible wealth through his ability, it was said, to mul­
tiply gold through the use of a secret substa nce. The rumor spread quickly 
because a few years earlier, a Venetian nobleman passing through Poland 
had heard a leamed man prophesy that Venice would recover her past 
glory and power if she could find a man who understood the alchemic art 
of manufacturing gold. And so, as word reached Venice of the gold this 
Bragadino possess ed-he clinked gold coins continuously in his hands , 
and golden objects filled his palace-s ome began to dream : Through hirn, 
their city would prosper again. 
Members of Venice's most important noble families accord ingly went 
together to Brescia, where Bragadino li ved. They toured his palace and 
watched in awe as he demonst rated his gold-making abiliti es, taking a 
pinch of seem ingly wort hless minerals and transforming it into several 
ounc es of gold dust. The Venetian senate prepared to debate the idea of ex­
tending an official invitation to Bragadino to stay in Venice at the city's ex­
pense, when word suddenly reached them that they were compet ing with 
the Duke of Mantua for bis serv ices. They heard of a mag nificent party in 
Bragadin o's palace for the duke, featuring garments with golden butto ns, 
gold watc hes, gold plates, and on and on. Wo rried they might lose Bra­
gadino to Mantua, the senate voted almost unanimously to invite hirn to 
Venice, promising him the mountain of money he would need to continue 
living in his luxurious style-but only if he came right away. 
Late that year the mysterious Bragadino arrived in Venice. With his 
piercing dark eyes under thick brows, and the two enormous black mastiffs 
that accompanied him everyw here, he was forbidding and impressive. He 
took up residence in a sumptuous palace on the island of the Giudecca, 
with the republic funding his banquets, his expensive clothes, and all his 
other whims. A kind of alchemy fever spread through Venice. On street 
corners, hawkers would sell coal, distilling apparat us, bellows, how-to 
books on the subject. Everyone began to practice alchemy-everyone ex­
cept Bragadino. 
The alchemist seemed to be in no hurry to begin manufacturing the 
gold that would save Venice from ruin. Strangely enough this only in­
creased his popularity and following ; people thronged from all over Eu­
rope, even Asia, to meet this remarkable man. Months went by, with gifts 
pouring in to Bragadino from all sides. Still he gave no sign of the miracle 
that the Venetians confidently expected hirn to produce. Eventually the cit­
izens began to grow impatient, wondering if he would wait forever. At first 
the senators warned them not to hurry hirn-he was a capricious devil, 
who needed to be cajoled. Finally, though, the nobility began to wonder 
too, and the senate came under pressure to showareturn on the city's bal­
looning investment. 
Bragadino had only scorn for the doubters, but he responded to them. 
He had, he said, already deposited in the city's mint the mysterious sub­
stance with which he multiplied gold. He could use this substance up all at 
once, and produce double the gold, but the more slowly the process took 
place, the more it would yield. If left alone for seven years, sealed in a cas­
ket, the substance would multiply the gold in the mint thirty times over. 
Most of the senators agreed to wait to reap the gold mine Bragadino 
promised. Others, however, were angry: seven more years of this man liv­
ing royally at the public trough ! And many of the common citizens of 
Venice echoed these sentiments. Finally the alchemist's enemies demanded 
he produce a proof of his skills: a substantial amount of gold, and soon. 
Lofty, apparently devoted to his art, Bragadino responded that Venice, 
in its impatience, had betrayed hirn, and would therefore lose his services. 
He left town, going first to nearby Padua, then, in 1590, to Munich, at the 
invitation of the Duke of Bavaria, who, like the entire city of Venice, had 
known great wealth but had fallen into bankruptcy through his own profli­
gacy, and hoped to regain his fortune through the famous alchemist's ser­
vices. And so Bragadino resumed the comfort able arrangement he had 
known in Venice, and the same pattern repeated itself. 
Interpretati on 
The young Cypriot Mamugna had lived in Venice for several years before 
reincarnating hirnself as the alchemist Bragadino. He saw how gloom had 
settled on the city, how everyone was hoping for a redemption from some 
indefinite source. While other charlatans mastered everyday cons based on 
sleight of hand, Mamugna mastered human nature. With Venice as his tar­
get from the start, he traveled abroad, made some money through his 
alchemy scams, and then returned to Italy, setting up shop in Brescia. 
There he created areputation that he knew would spread to Venice. From 
a distance, in fact, his aura of power would be all the more impressive. 
At first Mamugna did not use vulgar demonstrations to convince peo-formerly strangled his 
wife and son. A courtier 
thought fit to inform the 
bereaved monarch, and 
even affirmed that he 
had seen the stag laugh. 
The rage of a king, says 
Solomon, is terrible, 
and especially that of 
a lion-king. "Pitiful 
foresterf" he exclaimed, 
"darest thou laugh 
when all around are 
dissolved in tears? We 
will not soU our royal 
claws with thy profane 
blood! Do thou, brave 
wolf, avenge our queen, 
by immolating this 
traitor to her august 
manes." 
Hereupon the stag 
replied: "Sire, the time 
for weeping is passed; 
grief is here superflu­
ous. Your revered 
spouse appeared to me 
but now, reposing on a 
bed of roses; J instantly

myself Let the king's 
despair remain for 
some time unchecked. it 
gratifies me.' " Scarcely 
had he spoken, when 
every one shouted: "A 
miracle! a miracle f" 
The stag, instead of 
being punished, re­
ceived a handsome gift.

dink of gold in his hands, all these provided a superior argument to any­
thing rational. And these established the cyde that kept him going: His ob­
vious wealth confirmed his reputation as an alchemist, so that patrons like 
the Duke of Mantua gave him money, which allowed him to live in wealth, 
which reinforced his reputation as an alchemist, and so on. Only once this 
reputation was established, and dukes and senators were fighting over hirn, 
did he resort to the trifling necessity of a demonstration. By then, however, 
people were easy to deceive: They wanted to believe. The Venetian sena­
tors who watched him multiply gold wanted to believe so badly that they 
failed to notice the glass pipe up his sleeve, from which he slipped gold 
dust into his pinches of minerals. Brilliant and capricious, he was the al­
chemist of their fantasies-and once he had created an aura like this, no 
one noticed his simple deceptions. 
Such is the power of the fantasies that take root in us, especially in 
times of scarcity and dedine. People rarely believe that their problems 
arise from their own misdeeds and stupidity. Someone or something out 
there is to blarne-the other, the world, the gods-and so salvation comes 
from the outside as weH. Had Bragadino arrived in Venice armed with a 
detailed analysis of the reasons behind the city's economic dedine, and of 
the hard-nosed steps that it could take to turn things around, he would 
have been scomed. The reality was too ugly and the solution too painful­
mostly the kind of hard work that the citizens' ancestors had mustered to 
create an empire. Fantasy, on the other hand-in this case the romance of 
alchemy-was easy to understand and infinitely more palatable. 
To gain power, you must be a source of pleasure for those around 
you-and pleasure comes from playing to people's fantasies. Never 
promise a gradual improvement through hard work; rather, promise the 
mo on, the great and sudden transformation, the pot of gold.

KEYS TO POWER 
Fantasy can never operate alone. It requires the backdrop of the humdrum 
and the mundane. It is the oppressiveness of reality that allows fantasy to 
take root and bloom. In sixteenth-century Venice, the reality was one of de­
dine and loss of prestige. The corresponding fantasy described a sudden 
recovery of past glories through the miracle of alchemy. While the reality 
only got worse, the Venetians inhabited a happy dream world in which 
their city restored its fabulous wealth and power ovemight, tuming dust 
into gold. 
The person who can spin a fantasy out of an oppressive reality has ac­
cess to untold power. As you search for the fantasy that will take hold of the 
masses, then, keep your eye on the banal truths that weigh heavily on us 
all. Never be distracted by people's glamorous portraits of themselves and 
their lives; search and dig far what really imprisons them. Once you find 
that, you have the magical key that will put great power in your hands. 
Although times and people change, let us examine a few of the oppres­
sive realities that endure, and the opportunities for power they provide: 
TM Reality: Change is slow and gradual. It requires hard work, a bit o[ luck, a [air 
amount o[selfsacrifice, and a lot p[patience. 
The Fantasy: A sudden transformation will bring a total change in one's fortunes, 
bypassing work, luck, selfsacrifice, and time in one [antastic stroke. 
This is of course the fantasy par excellence of the charlatans who

Promise a great and total change-from poor to rich, sickness to health,

How did the great sixteenth -century German quack Leonhard 
Thumeisser become the court physician for the Elector of Brandenburg 
without ever studying medicine? Instead of offering amputations, leeches, 
and foul-tasting purgatives (the medicaments of the time), Thumeisser of­
fered sweet-tasting elixirs and promised instant recovery. Fashionable 
courtiers especially wanted his solution of "drinkable gold," which cost a 
fortune. If so me inexplicable illness assailed you, Thumeisser would con­
sult a horoscope and prescribe a talisman. Who could resist such a 
fantasy-health and well-being without sacrifice and pain! 
The Reality: The social realm has hard-set codes and boundaries. We understand 
these limits and know that we have to move within the same [amiliar circles, day in 
and day out. 
The Fantasy: We can enter a totally new world with different codes and the promise 
o[ adventure. 
In the early 1700s, all London was abuzz with talk of a mysterious 
stranger, a young man named George Psalmanazar. He had arrived from 
what was to most Englishmen a fantastical land: the island of Formosa 
(now Taiwan), off the coast of China. Oxford University engaged 
Psalmanazar to teach the island's language ; a few years later he translated 
the Bible into Formosan, then wrote a book-an immediate best-seIler-on 
Formosa's history and geography. English royalty wined and dined the 
young man, and everywhere he went he entertained his hosts with won­
drous stories of his homeland, and its bizarre customs. 
After Psalmanazar died, however, his will revealed that he was in fact 
merely a Frenchman with a rich imaginati on. Everything he had said about 
Formosa-its alphabet, its language, its literature, its entire culture-he had 
invented. He had built on the English publ ic's ignorance of the place to 
concoct an elaborate story that fulfilled their desire for the exotic and 
LAW 32 267 
268 LAW 32 strange. British culture's rigid control of people's dangerous dreams gave 
hirn the perfect opportunity to exploit their fantasy. 
The fantasy of the exotic, of course, can also skirt the sexual. It must 
not come too elose, though, for the physical hinders the power of fantasy; it 
can be seen, grasped, and then tired of-the fate of most courtesans. The 
bodily charms of the mistress only whet the master's appetite for more and 
different pleasures, a new beauty to adore. To bring power, fantasy must re­
main to some degree unrealized, literally unreal. The dancer Mata Hari, 
for instance, who rose to public prominence in Paris before World War I, 
had quite ordinary looks. Her power came from the fantasy she created of 
being strange 'and exotic, unknowable and indedphera ble, The taboo she 
worked with was less sex itself than the breaking of sodal codes. 
Another form of the fantasy of the exotic is simply the hope for relief 
from boredom. Con artists love to play on the oppressiveness of the work­
ing world, its lack of adventure. Their cons might involve, say, the recov­
ery of lost Spanish treasure, with the possible partidpation of an alluring 
Mexican seiiorita and a connection to the president of a South American 
country-anything offering release from the humdrum. 
The Reality: Society is frag;mented and foll of conflict. 
The Fantasy: People can come together in a mystical union ofsouls. 
In the 1920s the con man Oscar Hartzell made a quick fortune out of 
the age-old Sir Frands Drake swindle-basically promising any sucker who 
happened to be surnamed "Drake" a substantial share of the long-lost 
"Drake treasure," to which Hartzell had access. Thousands across the Mid­
west fell for the scam, which Hartzell eleverly turned into a crusade against 
the government and everyone else who was trying to keep the Drake for­
tune out of the rightful hands of its heirs. There developed a mystical union 
of the oppressed Drakes, with emotional rallies and meetings . Promise such 
a union and you can gain much power, but it is a dangerous power that can 
easily turn against you. This is a fantasy for demagogues to play on. 
The Reality: Death. The dead cannot be brought back, the past cannot be changed. 
The Fantasy: A sudden reversal ofthis intolerable fact. 
This con has many variations, but requires great skill and subtlety. 
The beauty and importance of the art of Vermeer have long been rec­
ognized, but his paintings are small in number, and are extremely rare. In 
the 1930s, though, Vermeers began to appear on the art market. Experts 
were called on to verify them, and pronounced them real. Pos session of 
these new Vermeers would crown a collector's career. It was like the resur­
rection of Lazarus: In a strange way, Vermeer had been brought back to 
life. The past had been changed. 
Only later did it come out that the new Vermeers were the work of a 
middle-aged Dutch forger named Han van Meegeren. And he had chosen 
Vermeer for his scam because he understood fantasy: The paintings would 
seem real precisely because the public, and the experts as weIl, so desper­
ately wanted to believe they were. 
Remember: The key to fantasy is distance. The distant has allure and 
promise, seems simple and problem free. What you are offering, then, 
should be ungraspabl e. Never let it become oppressively familiar; it is the 
mirage in the distance, withdrawing as the sucker approac hes. Never be 
too direct in describing the fantasy-keep it vague. As a forger of fantasies, 
let your victim come elose enough to see and be tempted, but keep hirn far 
away enough that he stays dreaming and desiring. 
Image: The

disappearing and reappear­
ing. We look at it, imagine, 
wonder, and pine-never fa­
miliar, continuous provoker 
of dream s. Do not offer 
the obvious. Promise 
the moon. 
Authority : A lie is an allurement, a fabrication, that can be embell­
ished into a fantasy. It can be elothed in the raiments of a mystic 
conceptio n. Truth is cold, sober fact, not so comfortable to absorb. 
A lie is more palatable. The most detested person in the world is 
the one who always teIls the truth, who never romances. . . . 
I found it far more interesting and profitable to romance than to 
tell the truth. (Joseph Weil, a.k.a. "The Yellow Kid," 1875-1976) 
LAW 32 269 
270 LAW 32 REVERSAL 
If there is power in tapping into the fantas ies of the masses, there is also 
danger. Fantasy usually contains an element of play-the public half real­
izes it is being duped, but it keeps the dream alive anyway, relishing the en­
tertainment and the temporary diversion from the every day that you are 
providing. So keep it light -never come too elose to the place where you 
are actually expected to produce results . That place may prove extremely 
hazardous. 
After Bragadino estab lished hirnself in Munieh, he found that the 
sober-minded Bavarians had far less faith in alchemy than the tempera­
mental Venetians. Only the duke really believed in it, for he needed it des­
perately to rescue him from the hopeless mess he was in. As Bragadino 
played his familiar waiting gam e, accepting gifts and expecting patience, 
the public grew angry. Money was being spent and was yielding no results. 
In 1592 the Bavarians dema nded justice, and eventually Bragadino found 
hirnself swinging from the gallo ws. As before, he had promised and had 
not delivered, but this time he had mis judged the forbearance of his hosts, 
and his inability to fulfill their fantasy proved fatal. 
One last thing: Never make the mistake of imagining that fantasy is al­
ways fant astical. It certa inly contrasts with reality, but reality itself is some­
times so theatrical and styli zed that fantasy be comes ad esire for simple 
things. The image Abraham Lincoln created of hirnself , for example, as a 
homespun country lawyer with a beard, made him the common man's 
president. 
P. T. Barn um created a successful act with Tom Thumb, a dwarf who 
dressed up as fam ous leaders of the past, such as Napoleon, and lam­
pooned them wickedly. The show delighted everyone, right up to Queen 
Victoria, by appealing to the fan tasy of the time: Enough of the vain­
glorious rulers of history, the common man knows best. Tom Thumb re­
versed the familiar pattern of fantasy in which the strange and unknown 
be comes the ideal. But the act still obeyed the Law, for underl ying it 
was the fantasy that the simple man is without problems, and is happier 
than the powerful and the rich. 
Both Lincoln and Tom Thumb played the commoner but carefully 
maintained their distanc e. Should you play with such a fantasy, you too 
must carefully cultivate distance and not allow your "common" persona to 
become too familiar or it will not project as fantasy.

272 LAW 33 FINDING THE THUMBSCR EW: A Strategie Plan of Action 
We all have resistan ces, We live with a perpetual arrn or around oUfselves 
to defend against change and the intrusive actions of friends and rivals. We 
would like no thing more than to be left to do things our own way. Con­
stantly butting up against these resistances will cost you a lot of energy. 
One of the most important things to realize about people, though, is that 
they all have a weakness, some part of their psychological arrn or that will 
not resist, that will bend to your will if you find it and push on it. Some peo­
pIe wear their weaknesses openly, others disguise them. Those who dis­
guise them are often the ones most effectively undone through that one 
chink in their arrn or. 
In planning YOUf assault, keep these principl es in mi nd: 
Pay Attention to Gestures and Unconscious Signals. As Sigmund 
Freud remarked, "No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chat­
ters with his fingertip s; betra yal oozes out of hirn at every pore." This is a 
critical concept in the search for a person's weakness -it is revealed by 
seemingly unimp ortant ge stures and passing words. 
The key is not only what you look for but where and how you look. 
Everyday conversation suppli es the richest mine of weaknesses, so train 
yourself to listen. Start by always seeming interested-the appearance of a 
sympathetic ear will SpUf anyone to talk. A clever trick, often used by the 
nineteenth-century French state sman Talleyrand, is to appear to open up to 
the other person, to share a secret with them. It can be completely made 
up, or it can be real but of no great importance to you-the impo rtant 
thing is that it should seern to come from the heart. This will usually elicit a 
response that is not only as frank as Y0ufS but more genuine--a response 
that reveals a weakness. 
If you suspect that someone has a particular soft spot, probe for it indi­
rectly. If, for instanc e, you sense that a man has a need to be loved, openly 
flatter him. If he laps up Y0uf compliments, no matter how obvious, you 
are on the right track. Train Y0uf eye for details-how someone tips a 
waiter, what delights aperson, the hidden messages in clothes. Find peo­
ple's idols, the things they worship and will do anything to get-perhaps 
you can be the supplier of their fanta sies. Rememb er: Since we all try to 
hide Ouf weakn esses, there is little to be learned from Ouf conscious beha v­
ior. What oozes out in the little things outside Ouf conscious control is what 
you want to know. 
Find the Helpless Child. Most wea knesses begin in childhood, before 
the self builds up compensa tory defen ses. Perhaps the child was pampered 
or indulged in a particular area, or perhaps a certain emotional need went 
unfulfi lled; as he or she grows older, the indulgence or the deficiency may 
be buried but never disa ppears. Knowing about a childh ood need gives 
you a powerful key to a person's weakn ess. 
One sign of this weak ness is that when you touch on it the person will 
often act like a child, Be on the lookout, then, for any behavior that should 
have been outgrown. If your victims or rivals went without something im­
portant, such as parental support, when they were children, supply it, or its 
facsimile. If they reveal a secret taste, a hidden indulgen ce, indulge it. In ei­
ther case they will be unable to resist you. 
Look for Cont rasts. An overt trait often conceals its opposite. People 
who thump their chests are often big cowards; a prudish exterior may hide 
a lascivious soul; the uptight are often screaming for advent ure; the shy are 
dying for attention. By probing beyond appeara nces, you will often find 
people's weaknesses in the opposite of the qualities they reveal to you. 
Find the We ak Link. Sometimes in your search for weaknesses it is not 
what but who that matters. In today's versions of the court, there is often 
someone behind the scenes who has a great deal of power, a tremendous 
influence over the person superficially on top. These behind-the-scenes 
powerbrokers are the group's weak link: Win their favor and you indirectly 
influence the king. Altematively, even in a group of people acting with the 
appearance of one will-as when a group und er attack closes ranks to resist 
an outsider-there is always a weak link in the chain. Find the one person 
who will bend under pressure. 
Fill the Void. The two main emotional voids to fill are insecurity and un­
happiness. The insecure are suckers for any kind of social validation; as for 
the chron ically unhappy, look for the roots of their unhappiness. The inse-­
eure and the unhappy are the people least able to disguise their weak­
nesses. The ability to fill their emotional voids is a great source of power, 
and an indefinitely prolongable one. 
Feed on Uncontrolla ble Emotions. The uncontrollable emotion can be 
a paranoid fear-a fear disproportionate to the situation-or any base mo­
tive such as lust, greed, vanity, or hatred. People in the grip of these emo­
tions often cannot control themselves, and you can do the controlling for 
them.

274 LAW 33 Louis, as the regent ruling France until her son reached his ma jori ty, Every­
one expected Richelieu to say the usual kind words to the young king. In­
stead, however, he looked directly at and only at the queen mother. Indeed 
his speech ended in long and fulsome praise of her, praise so glowing that it 
actually offended some in the Church . But the smile on the queen's face as 
she lapped up Richelieu' s compliments was unforgetta ble. 
A year later the queen mother appointed Richelieu secretary of state 
for foreign affa irs, an incredible coup for the young bishop. He had now 
ente red the inner cirele of power, and he studied the workings of the court 
as if it were the machinery of a watch. An Itali an, Concino Concini, was 
the queen mother 's favorite, or rather her lover, a role that made hirn per­
haps the most powerful man in France. Concini was vain and foppish, and 
Richelieu played him perfect ly-atte nding to him as if he were the king. 
Within months Richelieu had become one of Concini's favorit es. But 
something happ ened in 1617 that turned everything upside down: the 
young king, who up until then had shown every sign of being an idiot, had 
Concini mur dered and his most important associates imp risoned, In so 
doing Louis took command of the country with one blow, sweeping the 
queen mother aside. 
Had Richelieu played it wrong? He had been elose to both Concini 
and Marie de Medicis, whose adv isers and ministers were now all out of 
favor, some even arrested. The queen mother herself was shut up in the 
Louvre, a virtual prisoner. Richelieu wasted no time . If everyone was de­
serting Marie de Medicis, he would stand by her. He knew Louis could not 
get rid of her, for the king was still very young, and had in any case always 
been inordinately attached to her. As Marie's only remaining powerful 
friend, Richelieu filled the valuable function of liaison between the king 
and his mother. In return he received her protection, and was able to sur­
vive the palace coup, even to thri ve. Over the next few years the queen 
mother grew still more dependent on hirn, and in 1622 she repaid hirn for 
his loyalty: Through the inte rcession of her allies in Rome, Richelieu was 
elevated to the powerful rank of cardinal. 
By 1623 King Louis was in trouble. He had no one he could trust to 
advise hirn, and although he was now a young man instead of a boy, he re­
mained childish in spirit, and affairs of state came hard to hirn. Now that he 
had taken the throne, Marie was no longer the regent and theoretica lly had 
no power, but she still had her son's ear, and she kept telling him that 
Richelieu was his only possible savior. At first Louis would have none of 
it-he hate d the cardinal with a passion, only tolerating him out of love for 
Marie. In the end, however, isolate d in the court and crippled by his own 
indecisiven ess, he yielded to his mother and made Richelieu first his chief 
councilor and later prime minister. 
Now Richelieu no longer needed Marie de Medicis. He stopp ed visit­
ing and courting her, stopped listening to her opinions, even argued with 
her and opposed her wishes. Instead he concentrated on the king, making 
himself indispensable to his new master. All the previous premiers, under­
standing the king's childis hness, had tried to keep him out of troubl e; the 
shrewd Richelieu played hirn differentl y, deliberately pushing hirn into 
one ambitious project after another, such as a crusade against the 
Huguenots and finally an extended war with Spain. The immensity of 
these projects only made the king more dependent on his powerful pre­
mier, the only man able to keep order in the realm. And so, for the next 
eighteen years, Richelieu, exploiting the king's weakne sses, govemed and 
molded France according to his own vision, unifying the country and mak­
ing it a strong European power for centuries to come. 
Interpretat ion 
Richelieu saw everything as a military campaign, and no strategie move 
was more important to hirn than discovering his enemy's weakne sses and 
applying pressure to them. As early as his speech in 1615, he was looking 
for the weak link in the chain of power, and he saw that it was the queen 
mother. Not that Marie was obviously weak-she govemed both France 
and her son; but Richelieu saw that she was really an insecure woman who 
needed constant masculine attention. He showered her with affection and 
respect, even toadying up to her favorite, Concini . He knew the day would 
come when the king would take over, but he also recognized that Louis 
loved his mother dearly and would always remain a child in relat ion to her. 
The way to control Louis, then, was not by gaining his favor, which could 
change ovemight, but by gaining sway over his mother, for whom his af­
fection would never change . 
Once Richelieu had the position he desired-prime minister-he dis­
carded the queen mother, moving on to the next weak link in the chain: 
the king's own character. There was apart of hirn that would always be a 
helpless child in need of higher authority. 1t was on the foundation of the 
king's weakne ss that Richelieu established his own power and farne. 
Remember: When entering the court, find the weak link. The person 
in control is often not the king or queen; it is someone behind the scenes­
the favorite, the husband or wife, even the court fool. This person may 
have more weaknesses than the king hirnself, because his power depends 
on all kinds of capricious factors outside his control. 
Finally, when dealing with helpless children who cannot make deci­
sions, play on their weakne ss and push them into bold ventures. They will 
have to depend on you even more, for you will become the adult figure 
whom they rely on to get them out of scrapes and to safety.

276 LAW 33 head of an engineering company, and entered into conversation with him . 
LoUer had made his fortune only recently, and forging social connections 
was very important to him . He feit honored and somewhat intimidated by 
this sophisticated man, who spoke perfect English with a hint of a foreign 
accent. Over the days to come, the two became friends. 
LoUer of course did most of the talking, and one night he confessed 
that his business was doing poorly, with more troubles ahead. In return, 
Lustig confided in his new friend that he too had serious money 
problems-Communists had seized his family estate and aU its assets. He 
was too old to learn a trade and go to work. Luckily he had found an an­
swer-"a money-making machine." "You counterf eit?" LaUer whispere d in 
half-shock. No, Lustig replied, explaining that through a secret chemical 
process, his machine could duplicate any paper currency with complete ac­
curacy. Put in a doUar bill and six hours later you had two, both perfect. He 
proceeded to explain how the machine had been smuggle d out of Europe, 
how the Germans had developed it to undermine the British, how it had 
supported the count for several years, and on and on. When LaUer insisted 
on a demonstration, the two men went to Lustig's room, where the count 
produced a magnificent mahogany box fitted with slots, cranks, and dials. 
Loller watched as Lustig inserted a dollar bill in the box. Sure enough, 
early the foUowing moming Lustig puUed out two bills, stiU wet from the 
chemicals. 
Lustig gave the notes to LaUer, who immediately took the bills to a 
local bank-which accepted them as genuin e. Now the businessman fever­
ishly begged Lustig to sell hirn a machin e. The count explained that there 
was only one in existence, so Loller made hirn a high offer: $25,000, then a 
considerable amount (more than $400,000 in today's terms). Even so, 
Lustig seemed reluctant: He did not feel right about making his friend pay 
so much. Yet finally he agreed to the sale. After all, he said, "I suppose it 
matters little what you pay me. You are, after all, going to recover the 
amount within a few days by duplicating your own bills." Making LoUer 
swear never to reveal the machine's existence to other people, Lustig ac­
cepted the money. Later the same day he checked out of the hotel. A year 
later, after many futile attempts at duplicating bills, LaUer finaUy went to 
the police with the story of how Count Lustig had conned hirn with a pair 
of doUar bills, some chemicals, and a worthless mahogany box. 
Interpretation 
Count Lustig had an eagle eye for other people's weakne sses. He saw them 
in the smallest gesture. LaUer, for instance, overtipped waiters, seemed 
nervous in conversation with the concierge, talked loudly about his busi­
ness. His weakne ss, Lustig knew, was his need for social validation and for 
the respect that he thought his wealth had earned hirn. He was also chroni­
cally insecure. Lustig had come to the hotel to hunt for prey. In LaUer he 
homed in on the perfect sucker-a man hungering for someone to fill his 
psychic voids. 
In offering LoUer his friendship, then, Lustig knew he was offering him 
the immediate respect of the other guests. As a count, Lustig was also offer-
ing the newly rich businessman access to the glittering world of old wealth. 
And for the coup de gräce, he apparently owned a machine that would res­
eue Laller from his worries. It would even put hirn on a par with Lustig 
hirnself, who had also used the machine to maintain his status. No wonder 
Loller took the bait. 
Rememb er: When searching for suckers, always look for the dissatis­
lied, the unhapp y, the insecure. Such people are riddled with weaknesses 
and have needs that you can fill. Their neediness is the groove in which 
you place your thumbnail and turn them at will.

In the year 1559, the French king Henri II died in a jousting exhibiti on. His 
son assumed the throne, becoming Francis II, but in the background stood 
Henri's wife and queen, Catherine de' Medicis, a woman who had long 
ago proven her skill in affairs of state. When Francis died the next year, 
Catherine took control of the country as regent to her next son in line of 
sueeession, the future Charles IX, a mere ten years old at the time. 
The main threats to the queen's power were Antoine de Bourbon, king 
of Navarre, and his brother, Louis, the powerful prince of Cande, both of 
whom could elaim the right to serve as regent instead of Catherine, who, 
after all, was Italian-a foreigner. Catherine quickly appointed Antoine 
lieutenant general of the kingdom, a title that seemed to satisfy his ambi­
tion. It also meant that he had to remain in court, where Catherine could 
keep an eye on hirn. Her next move proved smarter still: Antoine had a 
notorious weakness for young women, so she assigned one of her most at­
traetive maids of honor, Louise de Rouet, to seduce hirn. Now Antoine's 
intimate, Louise reported all of his actions to Catherin e. The move worked 
so brilliantly that Catherine assigned another of her maids to Prince 
Conde, and thus was formed her escadron volant\-"f lying squadron"-of 
young girls whom she used to keep the unsuspecting males in the court 
under her control. 
In 1572 Catherine married off her daughter, Marguerite de Valois, to 
Henri, the son of Antoine and the new king of Navarre. To put a family that 
had always struggled against her so elose to power was a dangerous move, 
so to make sure of Henri's loyalty she unleashed on hirn the loveliest mem­
ber of her "flying squadron," Charlotte de Beaune Semblan�ay, baroness 
of Sauves. Catherine did this even though Henri was married to her daugh­
ter. Within weeks, Marguerite de Valois wrote in her memoirs, "Mme. de 
Sauves so completely ensnared my husband that we no longer slept to­
gether, nor even conversed." 
The baroness was an excellent spy and helped to keep Henri under 
Catherine's thumb. When the queen's younge st son, the Duke of Alen�on, 
grew so elose to Henri that she feared the two might plot against her, she 
assigned the baroness to hirn as weIl . This most infamous member of the 
flying squadron quickly seduced Alen�on, and soon the two young men 
fought over her and their friendship quickly ended, along with any danger 
of a conspiracy. And while I am on the 
subject, there is another 
fact that deserves 
mention. I t is this. A 
man shows his charae­
ter just in the way in 
which he deals with 
trifles-for then he is 
off his guard. This will 
often afford a good 
opportunity of ohserv­
ing ehe boundless 
egoism of a man's 
nature, and his total 
lack of consideration 
for others; and if these 
defcets show them­
selves in small things, 
or merely in his general 
demeanour, you will 
find that they also 
underhe his action in 
matters of importancc, 
although he may 
disguise the fact. This ü 
an opportl/nity whieh 
should not he missed. 
If in the liule affairs of 
every day-th e trifIes of 
life ... -a man is

only what is advanta­

he appropriates to

Catherine had seen very early on the sway that amistress has over a man 
of power: Her own husband, Henri 11, had kept one of the most infamous 
mistresses of them all, Diane de Poitiers_ What Catherine learned from the 
experience was that a man like her husband wanted to feel he could win a 
woman over without having to rely on his status, which he had inherited 
rather than earned_ And such a need contained a huge blind spot: As long 
as the woman began the affair by acting as if she had been conquered, the 
man would fail to notice that as time passed the mistress had come to hold 
power over hirn, as Diane de Poitiers did over Henri_ It was Catheri ne's 
strategy to turn this weakne ss to her advantage , using it as a way to conquer 
and control men. All she had to do was unleash the loveliest women in the 
court, her "flying squadro n," on men whom she knew shared her hus­
band's vulnerability. 
Remem ber: Always look for passions and ob sessions that cannot be 
controlled. The stronger the passion, the more vulnerable the person. This 
may seem surprising, for passionate people look strong. In fact, however, 
they are simply filling the stage with their theatricality, distracting people 
from how weak and helpless they really are. A man's need to conquer 
women actually reveals a tremendous helplessness that has made suckers 
out of them for thousands of years. Look at the part of a person that is most 
visible-their greed, their lust, their intense fear. These are the emotions 
they cannot conceal, and over which they have the least control. And what 
people cannot control, you can control for them.

Arabella Hunting ton, wife of the great late-nineteenth-century railroad 
magnate Collis P. Huntington, came from humble origins and always 
struggled for social recognition among her wealthy peers. When she gave a 
party in her San Francisco mansion, few of the social elite would show Upj 
most of them took her for a gold digger, not their kind. Because of her hus­
band's fabulous wealth, art dealers courted her, but with such condesc en­
sion they obviously saw her as an upstart. Only one man of conseq uence 
treated her different ly: the dealer Joseph Duveen. 
For the first few years of Duveen's relationship with Arabella, he made 
no effort to seIl expensive art to her. Instead he accompanied her to fine 
stores, chatted endlessly about queens and princesses he knew, on and on. 
At last, she thought, a man who treated her as an equal, even a superior, in 
high society. Meanwhile, ifDuveen did not try to seIl art to her, he did sub­
tly educate her in his aesthetic ideas-namely, that the best art was the 
most expensive art. And after Arabella had soaked up his way of seeing 
things, Duveen would act as if she always had exquisite taste, even though 
before she met hirn her aesthetics had been abysmal. 
When Collis Huntington died, in 1900, Arabella came into a fortune. 
She suddenly started to buy expensive paintings, by Rembrandt and 
Veläzquez, for example-and only from Duveen. Years later Duveen sold 
her Gainsboroug h's Blue Boy for the highest price ever paid for a work of 
art at the time, an astounding purchase for a family that previously had 
shown little interest in collecting. 
Interpretation 
Joseph Duveen instantly understood Arab ella Huntington and what made 
her tick : She wanted to feel important, at horne in soci ety. Intensely inse­
eure about her lower-class background, she needed confirmation of her 
new social stat us. Duveen waited. Instead of rushing into trying to per­
suade her to collect art, he subtly went to work on her weak nesses. He 
made her feel that she deserved his atte ntion not because she was the wife 
of one of the wealth iest men in the world but because of her own special 
eharac ter-and this completely melted her. Duveen never condescended 
to Ara beIla; rather than lecturing to her, he instilled his ideas in her indi­
reetly. The result was one of his best and most devoted clients, and also the 
sale of The Blue Boy. 
People's need far validation and recognit ion, their need to feel impor­
tant, is the best kind of wea kness to expl oit. First, it is almost univers al; sec­
ond, exploiting it is so very easy. All you have to do is find ways to make 
people feel better about their taste , their sodal standing, their intellig ence. 
Once the fish are hooked, you can reel them in again and aga in, for 
years -you are filling a positive role, giving them what they cannot get on 
their own. They may never suspect that you are turning them like a thumb­
serew, and if they do they may not care, because you are making them feel 
better about themselve s, and that is worth any price. 
Observance V 
In 1862 King William of Prussia named Otto von Bismarck premier and 
minister for foreign affa irs. Bismarck was known for his boldness, his ambi­
tion-and his interest in strengthening the military. Since William was sur­
rounded by liberal s in his govemment and cabinet, politidans who already 
wanted to limit his powers, it was quite dangerous for hirn to put Bismarck 
in this sensitive position. His wife , Queen Augusta, had tried to dis suade 
hirn, but although she usually got her way with hirn, this time William 
stuck to his guns. 
Only a week after becom ing prime minister, Bismarck made an im­
promptu speech to a few dozen ministers to convince them of the need to 
enlarge the army. He ended by saying, "The great questions of the time 
will be dedded, not by speeches and resolutions of majorities, but by iron 
and blood." His speech was immediately disseminated throughout Ger­
many. The queen screamed at her husband that Bismarck was a barbaric 
militar ist who was out to usurp control of Pru ssia, and that William had to 
lire hirn. The liber als in the govemment agreed with her. The outcry was 
so vehement that WiIliam began to be afraid he would end up on a scaf­
fold, like Louis XVI of France, if he kept Bismarck on as prime minister. 
Bismarck knew he had to get to the king befare it was too late . He also 
knew he had blundered, and should have tempered his fiery words. Yet as 
he contemplated his strategy, he decided not to apologize but to do the 
exact opposite. Bismarck knew the king weIl. Caesar had instructed 
them, in hopes that 
young gentlemen, who 
had not known much 
of baltles and wounds, 
but came wearing their 
hair long, in ehe jlower 
of their age and height 
of their beauty, would 
be more apprehensive 
ofsuch blows, and not 
care for hazarding both 
a danger at present and 
a blemish for the 
future. 
And so it proved, for 
they were so far from 
bearing the stroke of 
the javelim; that they 
eould not stand the 
sight ofthem, but 
turned about, ami 
eovered their faces to 
see ure them. Onee in 
disorder, presently they 
turned about to jly; and 
so most shamefully 
ruined alf. For those 
who had beat them 
hack at onee 
outjlanked the infantry, 
and falling on their 
rear, cut ehem to pieces. 
Pompey, who 
eommanded the other 
wing ofthe army, when 
he saw his cavalry thus 
broken and flying, was 
no longer himself; nor 
did he now remember 
that he was Pompey the 
Great, but, like one 
whom some god had 
deprived of his senses, 
retired to his tent with­
out speaking a word, 
and there sat to expect 
the event, till the whole 
army was routed.

280 LAW 33 When the two men met, William, predictably, had been worked into a 
tizzy by the queen. He reiterated his fear of being guil lotined. But Bismarck 
only replied, "Yes, then we shall be dead! We must die sooner or later, and 
could there be a more respectable way of dying? I should die fighting for 
the cause of my king and master. Your Ma je sty would die sealing with your 
own blood your royal rights granted by God's grace. Whether upon the 
scaffold or upon the battle field make s no difference to the glorious staking 
of body and life on behalf of rights granted by God's grace !" On he went, 
appealing to Willi am's sense of honor and the majesty of his position as 
head of the army. How could the king allow people to push hirn around? 
Wa sn't the honor of Germany more important than quibbling over words? 
Not only did the prime minister convince the king to stand up to both his 
wife and his parliament, he persuaded hirn to build up the army- Bis­
marck's goal all along. 
Interpretation 
Bismarck knew the king feIt buHied by those around hirn. He knew that 
William had a military background and a deep sense of honor, and that he 
feit ashamed at his cravenness before his wife and his government. William 
secretly yearned to be a great and mighty king, but he dared not express 
this ambition because he was afraid of ending up like Louis XVI. Where a 
show of courage often conceals a man's timidity, William's timidity con­
cealed his need to show courage and thump his chest. 
Bismarck sensed the longing for glory beneath Willi am's pacifist front, 
so he played to the king's insecurity about his manhood, finaHy pushing 
hirn into three wars and the creation of a German empire. Timidity is a po­
tent weakness to exploit. Timid souls often yearn to be their opposit e-to 
be Napoleons. Yet they lack the inner strength. You, in essence, can be­
come their Na poleon, pushing them into bold act ions that serve YOUf 
needs while also making them dependent on you. Remember: Look to the 
opposites and never take appearances at face value.

Authority: Find out each man's thumbscrew. 'Tis the art of setting their

where to get at anyone. Every volition has a special motive which varies 
according to taste. All men are idolaters, some of farne, others of self­
interest, most of pleasure. Skill consists in knowing these idols in order 
to bring them into play. Knowing any man's mainspring of motive 
you have as it were the key to his will. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) 
REVERSAL 
Playing on people's weakness has one significant danger: You may stir up 
an action you cannot control. 
In YOUf games of power you always look several steps ahead and plan 
accordingly. And you exploit the fact that other people are more emotional 
and incapable of such foresight. But when you play on their vulnerabiliti es, 
the areas over which they have least control, you can unleash emotions 
that will upset YOUf plans. Push timid people into bold action and they may 
go too far; answer their need for attention or recognition and they may 
need more than you want to give them. The helpless, childish element you 
are playing on can turn against you. 
The more emotional the weakness, the greater the potential danger. 
Know the limits to this game, then, and never get carried away by your 
control over YOUf victims. You are after power, not the thrill of control.

TRANSGR ESSION OF THE LAW 
In July of 1830, a revolution broke out in Paris that forced the king, 
Charles X, to abdicate . A commission of the highest authoriti es in the land 
gathered to choose a successor, and the man they picked was Louis­
Philippe, the Duke of Orleans. 
From the beginning it was clear that Louis-Philippe would be a differ­
ent kind of king, and not just because he came from a different branch of 
the royal family, or because he had not inherited the crown but had been 
given it, by a commission, putting his legitimacy in question. Rather it was 
that he disliked ceremony and the trappings of royalty ; he had more 
friends among the bankers than among the nobil ity; and his style was not 
to create a new kind of royal rule, as Napoleon had done, but to downplay 
his status, the better to mix with the businessmen and middle-class folk 
who had called hirn to lead. Thus the symbols that came to be associa ted 
with Louis-Philippe were neither the scepter nor the crown, but the gray 
hat and umbrella with which he would proudly walk the streets of Paris, as 
ifhe were a bourgeois out for a stroll. When Louis-Philip pe invitedJames 
Rothschild, the most important banker in France, to his palace, he treated 
him as an equal. And unlike any king before hirn, not only did he talk busi­
ness with Monsieur Rothschild but that was literally all he talked, for he 
loved money and had amassed a huge fortune. 
As the reign of the "bourgeois king" plodded on, people came to de­
spise hirn . The aristocracy could not endure the sight of an unkingly king, 
and within a few years they tumed on hirn. Meanwhile the growing class of 
the poor, including the radicals who had chased out Charles X, found no 
satisfaction in a ruler who neither acted as a king nor govemed as a man of 
the people. The bankers to whom Louis-Phili ppe was the most beholden 
soon realized that it was they who controlled the country, not he, and they 
treated hirn with growing contempt. One day, at the start of a train trip or­
ganized for the royal family, James Rothschild actually berated him-and 
in public-for being late. Once the king had made news by treating the 
banker as an equal; now the banker treated the king as an inferior. 
Eventually the workers' insurrections that had brought down Louis­
Philippe's predecessor began to reemerge, and the king put them down 
with force. But what was he defending so brutally? Not the institution ofthe 
monarchy, which he disdained, nor a democra tic republic, which his rule 
prevente d. What he was really defending, it seemed, was his own fortune, 
and the fortunes of the bankers-not a way to inspire loyalty among the 
citizenry. 
In early 1848, Frenchmen of all classes began to demonstrate for elec­
toral reforms that would make the country truly democrat ic. By February 
the demonstrations had tumed violent. To assuage the populace, Louis­
Philippe fired his prime minister and appointed a liberal as areplacement. 
But this created the opposite of the desired effect: The people sensed they 
could push the king around. The demonstrations tumed into a full-fledged 
revoluti on, with gunfire and barricades in the streets. Never lose your 
self-respect, nor be too

rather out of respect

284 LAW 34 On the night of February 23, a crowd of Parisians surrounded the 
palac e. With a suddenness that caught everyone by surprise, Louis­
Phil ippe abdicated that very evening and fled to England. He left no suc­
cessor, nor even the suggestion of one--his whole government folded up 
and dissolved like a traveling circus leaving town. 
Interpretation 
Louis- Philippe consciously dissolved the aura that naturally pertains to 
kings and leaders. Scof fing at the symbolism of gran deur, he believed a 
new world was dawning, where rulers should act and be like ordinary citi­
zens. He was right: A new world, without kings and queens, was cert ainly 
on its way. He was profoundly wrong, however, in predict ing a change in 
the dynamics of power. 
The bourge ois king's hat and umbrella amu sed the French at first, but 
soon grew irritating. People knew that Louis-Philippe was not really like 
them at all-that the hat and umbrella were essentially a kind of trick to en­
courage them in the fantasy that the country had suddenly grown more 
equal. Actually, though, the divisions of wealth had never been grea ter. 
The French expected their ruler to be a bit of a showman, to have some 
presence. Even a radical like Robespierre, who had briefly come to power 
during the French Revolution fifty years earlier, had understood this, and 
certainly Napoleon, who had turned the revolutionary republic into an im­
perial regime, had known it in his bones. Indeed as soon as Louis- Philippe 
fled the stage, the French revealed their true desire: They elected 
Napoleon's grand-nephew president. He was a virtual unk nown, but they 
hoped he would re-crea te the great general's powerful aura, erasing the 
awkw ard memory of the "bourgeois king ." 
Powerful people may be tempted to affe ct a common-man aura, trying 
to create the illusion that they and their subjects or underlings are basi cally 
the same. But the people whom this false ge sture is intended to impress will 
quickly see through it. They understand that they are not being given more 
power-that it only appears as if they shared in the powerful person's fate. 
The only kind of common touch that works is the kind affe cted by Franklin 
Roosevelt, a style that said the president shared values and goals with the 
common people even while he remained a patrician at heart. He never 
pretended to erase his distance from the crowd. 
Leaders who try to dissolve that dista nce through a false chumminess 
gradually lose the ability to inspire loyalty, fear, or love. Instead they elicit 
contempt. Like Louis- Philippe, they are too uninspiring even to be worth 
the guillotine--the best they can do is simply vanish in the night, as if they 
were never there. 
OBSER VA NCE OF THE LAW 
When Christopher Columbus was trying to find funding for his legendary 
voyages, many around hirn believed he came from the ltalian aristocra cy. 
This view was passed into history through a biography written after the ex­
plorer's dea th by his son, which describes hirn as a descendant of a Count 
Colombo of the Castle of Cuccaro in Montferrat. Colombo in turn was said 
to be descended from the legendary Roman general Colonius, and two of 
his first cousins were supposedly direct descenda nts of an emperor of Con­
stantinopl e. An ilIustrious background indeed. But it was nothing more 
than ilIustrious fantasy, for Columbus was actually the son of Domenico 
Colomb o, a humble weaver who had opened a wine shop when Christo­
pher was a young man, and who then made his living by seIling cheese. 
Columbus hirnself had created the myth of his noble backgro und, be­
cause from early on he feit that destiny had singled hirn out for great 
things, and that he had a kind of royalty in his blood. Accordingly he acted 
as if he were indeed descended from noble stock. After an uneventful ca­
reer as a merchant on a commercial vessel, Columbus, originally from 
Genoa, settled in Lisbon. Using the fabricated story of his noble back­
ground, he married into an established Lisbon family that had exceIIent 
connections with Portuguese royalty. 
Through his in-Iaws, Columbus finagled a meeting with the king of 
Portugal, Joäo 11, whom he petitioned to finance a westward voyage aimed 
at discovering a shorter route to Asia. In return for announcing that any 
discoveries he achieved would be made in the king's name, Columbus 
Iiowanted aseries of rights: the title Grand Admiral of the Oceanic Sea; the 
office of viceroy over any lands he found; and 10 percent of the future 
commerce with such lands. All of these rights were to be hereditary and for 
aIl time. Columbus made these demands even though he had previously 
been a mere merchant, he knew almost nothing about navigati on, he could 
not work a quadrant, and he had never led a group of men. In short he had 
absolutely no qualifications for the journey he proposed. Furthermore, his 
petition incIuded no details as to how he would accomplish his plans, just 
vague promises. 
When Columbus finished his pitch, Joäo 11 smiled: He politely de­
cIined the offer, but left the door open for the future. Here Columbus mu�t 
have noticed something he would never forget: Even as the king turned 
down the sailor's demands, he treated them as legitimate . He neither 
laughed at Columbus nor questioned his background and credentials . In 
fact the king was impressed by the boldness of Columbus's requests, and 
cIearly feit comfortable in the company of a man who acted so confidently. 
The meeting must have convinced Columbus that his instincts were cor­
rect: By asking for the mo on, he had instantly raised his own status, for the 
king assumed that unless a man who set such a high price on hirnself were 
mad, which Columbus did not appear to be, he must somehow be worth it. 
A few years later Columbus moved to Spain. Using his Portuguese 
connections, he moved in elevated circles at the Spanish court, receiving 
subsidies from ilIustrious financiers and sharing tables with dukes and 
princes. To all these men he repeated his request for financing for a voyage 
to the west-and also for the rights he had demanded fromJoäo 11. Some, 
such as the powerful duke of Medina, wanted to help, but could not, since 
they lacked the power to grant hirn the titles and rights he wanted. But 
Columbus would not back down. He soon realized that only one person HII'f'OCLLI IlE" ,\'I'

286 LAW 34 could meet his demands: Queen Isabella. In 1487 he finally managed a 
meeting with the queen, and although he could not convince her to finance 
the voyage , he completely charmed her, and became a frequent guest in 
the palace. 
In 1492 the Spanish finally expelled the Moorish invaders who cen­
turies earlier had seized parts of the country. With the wartime burden on 
her treasury lifted, Isabella feit she could finally respond to the demands of 
her explorer friend, and she decided to pay for three ships, equipment, the 
salaries of the crews, and a modest stipend for Columbus. More important, 
she had a contract drawn up that granted Columbus the titles and rights on 
which he had insisted. The only one she denied -and only in the contract's 
fine print-was the 10 percent of all revenues from any lands discovered: 
an absurd demand, since he wanted no time limit on it. (Had the clause 
been left in, it would eventually have made Columbus and his heirs the 
wealthiest familyon the planet. Columbus never read the fine print.) 
Satisfied that his demands had been met, Columbus set sail that same 
year in search of the passage to Asia. (Before he left he was careful to hire 
the best navigator he could find to help hirn get there.) The mission failed 
to find such a passage, yet when Columbus petitioned the queen to finance 
an even more ambitious voyage the following year, she agreed. By then 
she had come to see Columbus as destined for great things, 
Interpretat ion 
As an explorer Columbus was mediocre at best. He knew less about the 
sea than did the average sailor on his ships, could never determine the lati­
tude and longitude of his discoveries, mistook islands for vast continents, 
and treated his crew badly. But in one area he was a genius: He knew how 
to seIl hirnself. How else to explain how the son of a cheese vendor, a low­
level sea merchant, managed to ingratiate hirnself with the highest royal 
and aristocratic farnilies? 
Columbus had an amazing power to charm the nobility, and it all 
came from the way he carried hirnself. He projected a sense of confidence 
that was completely out of proportion to his means. Nor was his confidence 
the aggressive, ugly self-promotion of an upstart-it was a quiet and calm 
self-assuran ce, In fact it was the same confidence usually shown by the no­
bility themselve s. The powerful in the old-style aristocracies feit no need to 
prove or assert themsel ves; being noble, they knew they always deserved 
more, and asked for it. With Columbus, then, they felt an instant affinity, 
for he carried hirnself just the way they did-elevated above the crowd, 
destined for greatness. 
Understa nd: It is within your power to set your own price. How you 
carry yourself reflects what you think of yourself. If you ask for little, shuf­
fle your feet and lower your head, people will assurne this reflects your 
character. But this behavior is not you-it is only how you have chosen to 
present yourself to other people. You can just as easily present the Colum­
bus front: buoyancy, confidence, and the feeling that you were born to 
wear a crown. 
With alt great deceivers there is a noteworthy occurrence to which they owe their 
power. In the actual act 0/ deception they are overcome by belief in themselves: it is 
this which then speaks so miraculousl y and compelti ngly to those around them.

KEYS TO POWER 
As children, we start OUf lives with great exuberance, expecting and de­
manding everything from the world. This generally carries over into OUf 
first forays into society, as we begin OUf careers . But as we grow older the 
rebuffs and failUfes we experience set up boundaries that only get firmer 
with time. Coming to expect less from the world, we accept limitations that 
are really self-imposed. We start to bow and scrape and apologize for even 
the simplest of requests. The solution to such a shrinking of horizons is to 
deliberately force ourselves in the opposite directio n-to downplay the 
failures and ignore the limitati ons, to make oUfselv es demand and expect 
as much as the child. To accomplish this, we must use a particular strategy 
upon oUfselves. Call it the Strategy of the Crown. 
The Strategy of the Crown is based on a simple chain of cause and ef­
fect: If we believe we are destined for great things, OUf belief will radiate 
outward, just as a crown creates an aura around a king. This outward radi­
ance will infect the people around us, who will think we must have reasons 
to feel so confident. People who wear crowns seem to feel no inner sense of 
the limits to what they can ask for or what they can accomplish. This too 
radiates outward. Limits and boundaries disappear. Use the Strategy of the 
Crown and you will be surprised how often it bears fruit. Take as an exam­
pIe those happy children who ask for whatever they want, and get it. Their 
high expectat ions are their charm. Adults enjoy granting their wishes- just 
as Isabella enjoyed granting the wishes of Columb us. 
Throughout history, people of undistinguished birth-the Theodoras of 
� Byzantium, the Columbu ses, the Beethovens, the Disraelis-have managed 
to work the Strategy of the Crown, believing so firmly in their own greatness 
that it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The trick is simp le: Be overcome 
by yoUf self-belief. Even while you know you are practicing a kind of de­
ception on YOUfse lf, act like a king. You are likely to be treated as one. 
The crown may separate you from other people, but it is up to you to 
make that separati on real: You have to act differently, demoll Strating your 
distance from those around you. One way to emphasize YOUf difference is 
to always act with dignity, no matter the circumsta nce. Louis-Philippe gave 
no sense of being different from other people -he was the banker king. 
And the moment his subjects threatened him, he caved in. Everyone 
sensed this and pounced. Lacking regal dignity and firmness of purpose, 
Louis-Philippe seemed an impostor, and the crown was easily toppled 
from his head. 
Regal bearing should not be confused with arrogan ce. Arrogance may 
seem the king's entitlement, but in fact it betrays insecurity. It is the very 
opposite of a royal demeanor. Hippoc!eides, c/imbing 
on to it, danced first 
.\'Onle Laconian dances, 
next some Attic ones, 
and ended by standing 
on his head and beat­
ing time with his legs in 
the air. The Laconian 
and Altic dan ces were 
bad enough; but 
Cleisthenes , thol/gh 
he already loathed the 
thought o[ having a 
son-in-law like that, 
nevertheless restrained 
himself and managed 
to avoid an outburst; 
but when he saw 
Hippocleides beating 
time with his legs, he 
could bear it no Ion ger. 
"Son of Tisander," he 
cried, "you have 
danced away your 
marriage."

288 LAW 34 Haile Selassie, mler of Ethiopia for forty or SO years beginning in 1930, 
was once a young man named Lij Tafari. He came from a noble family, but 
there was no real chance of hirn coming to power, for he was far down the 
line of succession from the king then on the throne, Menelik 11. Neverthe­
less, from an early age he exhibited a self -confidence and a royal bearing 
that surprised everyone around hirn. 
At the age of fourteen, Tafari went to live at the court, where he imme­
diately impressed Menelik and became his favorite . Tafar i's grace under 
fire, his patien ce, and his calm self-assurance fascinated the king. The other 
young nobles, arrogant, blustery, and envious, would push this slight, 
bookish teenager around. But he never got angry-that would have been a 
sign of insecurity, to which he would not stoop. There were already people 
around hirn who feIt he would someday rise to the top, for he acted as ifhe 
were already there. 
Years later, in 1936, when the ltalian Fascists had taken over Ethiopia 
and Tafari, now called Haile Selassie, was in exile, he addressed the League 
of Nations to plead his country 's case. The Italians in the audience heckled 
hirn with vulgar abuse, but he maintained his dignified pose, as if corn­
. pletely unaff ected. This elevated hirn while making his opponents look 
even uglier. Dignity, in fact, is invariably the mask to assurne under difficult 
circumsta nces: It is as if nothing can affect you, and you have all the time 
in the world to respond. This is an extremely powerful pose. 
A royal demeanor has other uses. Con artists have long known the 
value of an aristocratic front; it either dis arms people and makes them less 
suspicious, or else it intimidates them and puts them on the defensiv�and 
as Count Victor Lustig knew, once you put a sucker on the defensive he is 
doomed. The con man Yellow Kid Weil, too, would often assurne the trap­
pings of a man of wealth, along with the nonchalance that goes with thern. 
Alluding to some magical method of making money, he would stand aloof, 
like a king, exuding confidence as if he really were fabulously rich. The 
suckers would beg to be in on the con, to have a chance at the wealth that 
he so clearly displayed. 
Finally, to reinf orce the inner psychological tricks involved in project­
ing a royal demeanor, there are outward strateg ies to help you create the 
effect. First, the Columbus Strategy: Always make a bold demand. Set your 
price high and do not waver. Second, in a dignified way, go after the high­
est person in the building. This immediately puts you on the same plane as 
the chief executive you are attacki ng. It is the David and Goliath Strategy: 
By choosing a great opponent, you create the appearance of great ness. 
Third, give a gift of some sort to those above you. This is the strategy 
of those who have a patron: By giving your patron a gift, you are essentially 
saying that the two of you are equal. It is the old con game of giving so that 
you can take. When the Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino wanted the 
Duke of Mantua as his next patron, he knew that if he was slavish and 
sycophantic, the duke would think hirn unworthy ; so he approached the 
duke with gifts, in this case paintings by the writer's good friend Titian. 
Accepting the gifts created a kind of equality between duke and writer: The 
duke was put at ease by the feeling that he was dealing with a man of his 
own aristocratie stamp. He funded Aretino generously. The gift strategy is 
subtle and brilliant beeause you do not beg: You ask for help in a dignified 
way that implies equality between two people, one of whom just happens 
to have more money. 
Remember: It is up to you to set your own priee. Ask for less and that 
is just what you will get. Ask for more, however, and you send a signal that 
you are worth a king's ransom. Even those who turn you down respeet you 
for your eonfidenee, and that respeet will eventually pay off in ways you 
cannot imagine. 
Image: The Crown. Plaee it upon your head 
and you assume a di fferent pose-tranquil 
yet radiating assuranee . Never show 
doubt, never lose your dignity beneath 
the erown, or it will not fit. It will seem 
to be destined for one more worthy. Do 
not wait for a eoronat ion; the great­
est emperors crown themselves . 
Authority : Everyone should be royal after his own fashion. Let all your 
actions, even though they are not those of a king, be, in their own 
sphere, worthy of one. Be sublime in your deeds, lofty in your 
thoughts; and in all your doings show that you deserve to be a king 
even though you are not one in reality. (Baltasar Graeiän, 1601-1658) 
LAW 34 289 
290 LAW 34 REVE RSAL 
The idea behind the assumption of regal confidence is to set yourself apart 
from other people, but if you take this too far it will be your undoing. 
Never make the mistake of thinking that you elevate yourself by humili at­
ing people. Also, it is never a good idea to 100m too high above the 
crow d-you make an easy target. And there are times when an aristocratic 
pose is eminently danger ous. 
Charles I, king of England during the 1640s, faced a profound public 
disenchantment with the institution of monarchy. Revolts erupted through­
out the country, led by Oliver Cromwell . Had Charles reacted to the times 
with insight, supporting reforms and making a show of sacrificing some of 
his power, history might have been different. Instead he reverted to an 
even more regal pose, seeming outraged by the assa ult on his power and 
on the divine institution of monarchy. His stiff kingli ness offended people 
and spurred on their revolts . And eventually Charles lost his head, liter ally. 
Understa nd: You are radiating confidence, not arrogance or disdain . 
Finally, it is true that you can sometimes find some power through af­
fecting a kind of earthy vulgarity, which will prove amusing by its extreme­
ness. But to the extent that you win this game by going beyond the limits, 
sep arating yourself from other people by appearing even more vulgar than 
they are, the game is dang erous: There will always be people more vulgar 
than you, and you will easily be replaced the following season by someone 
younger and worse.

292 LAW 35 OBSER VAN CE OF THE LAW 
Starting out in life as a nondescript French seminary- school teacher, Joseph 
Fouche wandered from town to town for most of the decade of the 1780s, 
teaching mathematics to young boys. Yet he never completely committed 
himself to the church, never took his vows as a prie st-he had bigger plans. 
Patiently waiting for his chance, he kept his options open. And when the 
French Revolution broke out, in 1789, Fouche waite d no longer: He got rid 
of his cassock, grew his hair long, and became a revolution ary. For this was 
the spirit of the times. To miss the boat at this critical moment could have 
spelt disaster. Fouche did not miss the boat: Befriending the revolutionary 
leader Robespierre, he quickly rose in the rebel ranks. In 1792 the town of 
Nantes elected Fouche to be its repres entative to the Nati onal Convention 
(created that year to frame a new cons titution for a French republic) . 
When Fouche arrived in Pari s to take his seat at the convention, a vio­
lent rift had broken out between the moderates and the radical Jacobins. 
Fouche sensed that in the long run neither side would emerge victorious. 
Power rarely ends up in the hands of those who start a revolution, or even 
of those who furth er it; power sticks to those who bring it to a conclusion. 
That was the side Fouche wanted to be on. 
His sense of timing was uncanny. He started as a moderate, for moder­
ates were in the majority. When the time came to decide on whether or not 
to execute Louis XVI, however, he saw that the people were clamoring for 
the king's head, so he cast the deciding vote--fo r the guillotine. Now he 
had become a radical. Yet as tensions came to the boll in Paris, he foresaw 
the danger of being too closely associated with any one facti on, so he ac­
cepted a position in the provinces, where he could lie low for a while . A 
few months later he was assigned to the post of proconsul in Lyons, where 
he oversaw the execution of dozens of aristocrats. At a certain moment, 
however, he called a halt to the killings, sensing that the mood of the coun­
try was turning-and despite the blood already on his hands, the citizens of 
Lyons hailed him as a savior from what had become known as the Terror. 
So far Fouche had played his cards brilliantly, but in 1794 his old 
friend Rob espierre recalled him to Paris to account for his actions in Lyons. 
Robespierre had been the driving force behind the Terror. He had sent 
heads on both the right and the left rolling, and Fouche, whom he no 
longer truste d, seemed desti ned to provide the next head. Over the next 
few weeks, a tense struggle ensued: While Rob espierre railed openly 
against Fouche, accusing of him dangerous ambit ions and calling for his ar­
rest, the crafty Fouche worked more indirectly, quietly gaining support 
among those who were beginning to tire of Robespierre's dictatorial con­
trol. Fouche was playing for time . He knew that the longer he survived, the 
more disaff ected citizens he could rally against Robespierre. He had to 
have broad support before he moved against the powernd leader. He ral­
lied support among both the moderates and the Jacobi ns, playing on the 
widespread fear of Robespi erre- -everyone was afraid of being the next to 
go to the guilloti ne. It all came to frui tion on July 27: The conve ntion 
tumed against Robespierre, shouting down his usual lengthy speech. He 
was quickly arre sted, and a few days later it was Robespierre 's head, not 
Fouche's, that fell into the basket. 
When Fouche returned to the convention after Ro bespierre 's death, he 
played his most unexpected move: Having led the conspiracy against 
Robespierre, he was expected to sit with the moderates, but 10 and behold, 
he once again changed sides, joining the radical Jacobins. For perhaps the 
first time in his life he aligned hirnself with the minority. Clearly he sensed 
areaction stirring: He knew that the modera te faction that had executed 
Robespierre, and was now about to take power, would initiate a new round 
of the Terror, this time against the radicals. In siding with the Jacobins, 
then, Fouche was sitting with the martyrs of the days to come---the people 
who would be considered blameless in the troubles that were on their way. 
Taking sides with what was about to become the losing team was a risky 
gambit, of course, but Fouche must have calculated he could keep his head 
long enough to quietly stir up the populace against the moderates and 
watch them fall from power. And indeed, although the moderates did call 
for his arrest in December of 1795, and would have sent hirn to the guillo­
tine, too much time had passed. The executions had be co me unpopular 
with the people, and Fouche survived the swing of the pendulum one more 
time. 
A new government took over, the Directoire . It was not, however, a 
Jacobin government, but a moderate one---more moderate than the gov­
emment that had reimposed the Terror. Fouche, the radical, had kept his 
head, but now he had to keep a low profile. He waited patiently on the 
sidelines for several years, allowing time to soften any bitter feelings 
against hirn, then he approached the Directoire and convinced them he 
had a new passion: intellig ence-gathering. He became a paid spy for the 
govemm ent, excelled at the job, and in 1799 was rewarded by being made 
minister of police. Now he was not just empowered but required to extend 
his spying to every corner of France---a responsibi lity that would greatly 
reinforce his natural ability to sniff out where the wind was blowing. One 
of the first social trends he detected, in fact, came in the person of 
Napoleon, a brash young general whose destiny he right away saw was en­
twined with the future of France. When Napoleon unleashed a coup d'etat, 
on November 9, 1799, Fouche pretended to be asleep. Indeed he slept the 
whole day. For this indirect assistance ---it might have been thought his job, 
after all, to prevent a military coup-Napoleon kept hirn on as minister of 
police in the new regime. 
Over the next few years, Napoleon came to rely on Fouche more and 
more. He even gave this former revolutionary a title, duke of Otranto, and 
rewarded hirn with great wealth. By 1808, however, Fouche, always at­
tuned to the times, sensed that Napoleon was on the downswing. His futile 
war with Spain, a country that posed no threat to France, was a sign that he 
was losing a sense of proportion. Never one to be caught on a sinking ship, 
Fouche conspired with Talleyrand to bring about Napoleon's downfall. Al-possessing a jlowing

294 LAW 35 though the conspiracy failed-Talleyrand was fired; Fouche stayed, but 
was kept on a tight leash-it publicized a growing discontent with the em­
peror, who seemed to be losing control. Ey 1814 Napoleon's power had 
crumbled and allied forces finally conquered hirn. 
The next government was arestoration of the monarchy, in the form 
of King Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI. Fouche, his nose always sniff­
ing the air for the next social shift, knew Louis would not last long-he had 
none of Napoleon's flair. Fouche once again played his waiting game, lying 
low, staying away from the spotlight. Sure enough, in February of 1815, 
Napoleon escaped from the island of Elba, where he had been imprisoned. 
Louis XVIII panicked: His policies had alienated the citizenry, who were 
clamoring for Napoleon's return. So Louis turned to the one man who 
could maybe have saved his hide, Fouche, the former radical who had sent 
his brother, Louis XVI, to the guillotine, but was now one of the most pop­
ular and widely admired politicians in France. Fouche, however, would not 
side with a loser: He refused Louis's request for help by pretending that bis 
help was unnecessa ry-by swearing that Napoleon would never return 
to power (although he knew otherwise). A short time later, of course, 
Napoleon and his new citizen army were closing in on Paris. 
Seeing his reign about to collapse, feeling that Fouche had betrayed 
hirn, and certain that he did not want this powerful and able man on 
Napoleon's team, King Louis ordered the minister's arrest and execution. 
On March 16, 1815, policemen surrounded Fouche's coach on a Paris 
boulevard. Was this finally his end? Perhaps, but not immediately : Fouche 
told the police that an ex-member of government could not be arrested on 
the street. They fell for the story and allowed hirn to return horne. Later 
that day, though, they came to his house and once again declared hirn 
under arrest. Fouche nodded-but would the officers be so kind as allow a 
gentleman to wash and to change his clothes before leaving his house for 
the last time? They gave their permission, Fouche left the room, and the 
minutes went by. Fouche did not return. Finally the policemen went into 
the next room-where they saw a ladder against an open window, leading 
down to the garden below. 
That day and the next the police combed Paris for Fouche, but by then 
Napoleon's cannons were audible in the distance and the king and all the 
king's men had to flee the city. As soon as Napoleon entered Paris, Fouche 
came out of hiding. He had cheated the executioner once again. Napoleon 
greeted his former minister of police and gladly restored hirn to his old 
post. During the 100 days that Napoleon remained in power, until Water-
100, it was essentially Fouche who governed France. After Napoleon fell, 
Louis XVIII returned to the throne, and like a cat with nine lives, Fauche 
stayed on to serve in yet another governmen t-by then his power and in­
fluence had grown so great that not even the king dared challenge hirn. 
Interpretation 
In aperiod of unprecedented turmoil, Joseph Fouche thrived through his 
mastery of the art of timing. He teaches us a number of key lessons. 
First, it is critical to recognize the spirit of the times. Fouche always 
looked two steps ahead, found the wave that would carry hirn to power, 
and rode it. You must always work with the times, anticipate twists and 
turns, and never miss the boat. Sometimes the spirit of the times is obscure: 
Recognize it not by what is loudest and most obvious in it, but by what lies 
hidden and dormant. Look forward to the Napoleons of the future rather 
than holding on to the ruins of the past. 
Second, recognizing the prevailing winds does not necessarily mean 
running with them. Any potent social movement creates a powerful reac­
tion, and it is wise to anticipate what that reaction will be, as Fouche did 
after the execution of Robespierre . Rather than ride the cresting wave of 
the moment, wait for the tide's ebb to carry you back to power. Upon occa­
sion bet on the re action that is brewing, and place yourself in the vanguard 
of it. 
Finally, Fouche had remarkable patience. Without patience as your 
sword and shield, your timing will fail and you will inevitably find yourself 
a loser. When the times were against Fouche, he did not struggle, get emo­
tional, or strike out rashly. He kept his cool and maintained a low profile, 
patiently building support among the citizenry, the bulwark in his next rise 
to power. Whenever he found hirnself in the weaker position, he played for 
time, which he knew would always be his ally if he was patient. Recognize 
the moment, then, to hide in the grass or slither under a rock, as weIl as the 
moment to bare your fangs and attack. 
KEYS TO POWER Space we can recover, time never. 
Nap oleon Bona parte, 1769-18 21 
Time is an artificial concept that we ourselves have created to make the 
limitlessness of eternity and the universe more bearable, more human. 
Since we have constructed the concept of time, we are also able to mold it 
to some degree, to play tricks with it. The time of a child is long and slow, 
with vast expanses; the time of an adult whizzes by frighteningly fast. 
Time, then, depends on perception, which, we know, can be willfully al­
tered. This is the first thing to understand in mastering the art of timing. If 
the inner turmoil caused by our emotions tends to make time move faster, 
it follows that once we control our emotional responses to events, time will 
move much more slowly. This altered way of dealing with things tends to 
lengthen our perception of future time, opens up possibilities that fear and 
anger dose off, and allows us the patience that is the principal requirement 
in the art of timing. 
There are three kinds of time for us to deal with; each presents prob­
lems that can be solved with skill and practice. First there is long time: the 
drawn-out, years-Iong kind of time that must be managed with patience 
and gentle guidance. Our handling of long time should be mostly defen­
sive-this is the art of not reacting impulsively, of waiting for opportunity. we shall be in trouble." 
So he had the fellow's 
feet cut off Both fami­
lies did exaetly the 
same thing, but one 
timed it right, the other 
wrong. Thus suecess 
depends on ... rhythm.

296 LAW 35 Next there is Jorced time: the short-term time that we can manipulate as an 
offensive weapon, upsetting the timing of oUf opponents. Finally there is 
end time, when a plan must be executed with speed and force. We have 
waited, found the moment, and must not hesitate. 
Long Time. The famous seventeenth -century Ming painter Chou Yung 
relates a story that altered his behavior forever. Late one winter af temoon 
he set out to visit a town that lay across the river from his own town. He 
was bringing some important books and papers with hirn and had commis­
sioned a young boy to help hirn carry them. As the ferry neared the other 
side ofthe river, Chou Yung asked the boatman ifthey would have time to 
get to the town before its gates closed, since it was a mHe away and night 
was approaching. The boatman glanced at the boy, and at the bundle of 
loosely tied papers and books-"Y es," he replied, "if you do not walk too 
fast." 
As they started out, however, the sun was setting. Afraid of being 
locked out of the town at night, prey to local bandits, Chou and the boy 
walked faster and faster, finally breaking into a run. Suddenly the string 
around the papers broke and the documents scattered on the ground. It 
took them many minutes to put the packet together again, and by the time 
they had reached the city gates, it was too late. 
When you force the pace out of fear and impatience, you create a nest 
of problems that require fixing, and you end up taking much longer than if 
you had taken YOUf time. Hurriers may occasionally get there quicker, but 
papers fly everywhere, new dangers arise, and they find themselves in con­
stant crisis mode, fixing the problems that they themselves have created . 
Sometimes not acting in the face of danger is YOUf best move-you wait, 
you deliberately slow down. As time passes it will eventually present op­
portunities you had not imagined. 
Waiting involves controlling not only YOUf own emotions but those of 
YOUf colleague s, who, rnistaking action for power, may try to push you into 
making rash moves. In YOUf rivals, on the other hand, you can encourage 
this same mistake : If you let them rush headlong into trouble while you 
stand back and wait, you will soon find ripe moments to intervene and pick 
up the pieces. This wise policy was the principal strategy of the great early­
seventeenth-century emperor Tokugawa Ieyasu of Japan. When his prede­
cessor, the headstrong Hideyoshi, whom he served as a general, staged a 
rash invasion of Korea, Ieyasu did not involve hirnself. He knew the inva­
sion would be a dis aster and would lead to Hideyoshi's downfa ll. Better to 
stand patiently on the sidelines, even Jor many years, and then be in position 
to seize power when the time is right-exactly what Ieyasu did, with great 
artistry. 
You do not delibera tely slow time down to live longer, or to take more 
pleasUfe in the moment, but the better to play the game of power. First, 
when YOUf mind is uncluttered by constant emergencies you will see fur­
ther into the future. Second, you will be able to resist the baits that people 
dangle in front of you, and will keep yourself from becoming another im­
patient sucker. Third, you will have more room to be flexible. Opportuni­
ties will inevitably arise that you had not expected and would have missed 
had you forced the pace. Fourth, you will not move from one deal to the 
next without completing the first one. To build your power's foundation 
can take years; make sure that foundation is secure. Do not be a flash in the 
pan-success that is built up slowly and surely is the only kind that lasts. 
Finally, slowing time down will give you a perspective on the times 
you live in, letting you take a certain distance and putting you in a less 
emotionally charged position to see the shapes of things to come. Hurriers 
will often mistake surface phenomena for a real trend, seeing only what 
they want to see. How much better to see what is really happening, even if 
it is unpleasant or makes your task harder. 
Forced Time. The trick in forcing time is to upset the timing of others-to 
make them hurry, to make them wait, to make them abandon their own 
pace, to distort their perception of time. Ey upsetting the timing of your op­
ponent while you stay patient, you open up time for yourself, which is half 
the game. 
In 1473 the great Turkish sultan Mehmed the Conqueror invited nego­
tiations with Hungary to end the off-and-on war the two countries had 
waged for years. When the Hungarian emissary arrived in Turkey to start 
the talks, Turkish officials humbly apologized-Me hmed had just left Istan­
bul, the capital, to battle his longtime foe, Uzun Hasan. Eut he urgently 
wanted peace with Hungary, and had asked that the emissary join hirn at 
the front. 
When the emissary arrived at the site of the fighting, Mehmed had al­
ready left it, moving eastward in pursuit of his swift foe. This happened 
several times. Wherever the emissary stopped, the Turks lavished gifts and 
banquets on hirn, in pleasurable but time-consuming ceremonies. Finally 
Mehmed defeated Uzun and met with the emissary. Yet his terms for peace 
with Hungary were excessively harsh. Mter a few days, the negotiations 
ended, and the usual stalemate remained in place. Eut this was fine with 
Mehmed. In fact he had planned it that way all along: Plotting his cam­
paign against Uzun, he had seen that diverting his armies to the east would 
leave his western flank vulnerable. To prevent Hungary from taking advan­
tage of his weakness and his preoccupation elsewhere, he first dangled the 
lure of peace before his enemy, then made them wait-all on his own 
terms. 
Making people wait is a powerful way of forcing time, as long as they 
do not figure out what you are up to. You control the dock, they linger in 
limbo-and rapidly come unglued, opening up opportunities for you to 
strike. The opposite effect is equally powerful : You make your opponents 
hurry. Start off your dealings with them slowly, then suddenly apply pres­
sure, making them feel that everything is happening at once. People who 
lack the time to think will make mistakes-so set their deadlines for them. 
LAW 35 297 
298 LAW 35 This was the technique Machiavelli admired in Cesare Borgia, who, during 
negotiati ons, would suddenly press vehemendy for adecision, upsetting 
his opponent's timing and patience. For who would dare make Cesare 
wait? 
Joseph Duveen, the famous art dealer, knew that if he gave an indeci­
sive buyer like John D. Rockef eller a deadline -the painting had to leave 
the country, another tycoon was int erested in it-the dient would buy just 
in time. Freud noticed that patients who had spent years in psychoa nalysis 
without improvement would miraculously recover just in time if he fixed a 
definite date for the end of the therapy. Jacques Lacan, the farnaus French 
psychoanalyst, used a variation on this tactic-he would sometimes end 
the customary hour session of therapy after only ten minute s, without 
waming. After this happened several times, the patient would realize that 
he had better make maximum use of the time, rather than wasting much of 
the hour with a lot of talk that meant nothing. The deadline, then, is a pow­
erful tool. Close off the vistas of indecision and force people to make up 
their damn minds or get to the point-never let them make you play on 
their excruciating terms. Never give them time. 
Magicians and showmen are experts in forcing time. Houdini could 
often wriggle free of handcuffs in minute s, but he would draw the escape 
out to an hour, making the audience sweat, as time came to an apparent 
standstill . Magicians have always known that the best way to alter our per­
ception of time is often to slow down the pace. Creating suspense brings 
time to a terrifying pause: The slower the magicia n's hands move, the eas­
ier it is to create the illusion of speed, making people think the rabbit has 
appeared instantan eously. The great nineteenth-century magician Jean-Eu­
gene Robert-Houdin took explicit notice of this effect: "The more slowly a 
story is told," he said, "the shorter it seems." 
Going slower also makes what you are doing more interest ing-the 
audience yields to your pace, becomes entranced. It is astate in which time 
whizzes delightfully by. You must practice such illusions, which share in the 
hypnotist's power to alter perceptions of time. 
End Time. You can play the game with the utmost artistry-waiting pa­
tiendy for the right moment to act, putting your competitors off their form 
by messing with their timing-but it won't mean a thing unless you know 
how to finish. Da not be one of those people who look like paragons of pa­
tience but are actually just afraid to bring things to a dose: Patience is 
worthless unless combined with a willing ness to fall ruthlessly on your op­
ponent at the right moment. You can wait as long as necessa ry for the con­
dusion to come, but when it comes it must come quickly. Use speed to 
paralyze your opponent, cover up any mistakes you might make, and im­
press people with your aura of authority and finality. 
With the patience of a snake charmer, you draw the snake out with 
calm and steady rhythms; Once the snake is out, though, would you dangle 
your foot above its deadly head? There is never a good reason to allow the 
slightest hitch in your endgame. Your mastery of timing can really only be 
judged by how you work with end time-how you quickly change the pace 
and bring things to a swift and definitive conclusion.

you want but cannot have, show contempt for it. The less

TRANSGR ESSION OF THE LAW 
The Mexican rebelleader Pancbo Villa started out as the chief of a gang of 
bandits, but after revolution broke out in Mexico in 1910, he became a 
kind of folk hero-robbing trains and giving the money to the poor, lead­
ing daring raids, and charming the ladies with romantic escapades. His ex­
ploits fascinated Americans-he seemed a man from another era, part 
Robin Hood, part Don Juan. After a few years of bitter fighting, however, 
General Carranza emerged as the victor in the Revolution; the defeated 
Villa and his troops went back horne, to the northem state of Chihuahua. 
His army dwindled and he tumed to banditry again, damaging his popu­
larity. Finally, perhaps out of desperation, he began to rail against the 
United States, the gringos, whom he blamed for his troubles. 
In March of 1916, Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New Mexico. Ram­
paging through the town, he and his gang killed seventeen American sol­
diers and civilians. President Woodrow Wilson, like many Americans, had 
admired Villa; now, however, the bandit needed to be punished. Wilson's 
advisers urged hirn to send troops into Mexico to capture Villa. For a 
power as large as the United States, they argued, not to strike back at an 
army that had invaded its territory would send the worst kind of signal. 
Furtherm ore, they continued, many Americans saw Wilson as a pacifist, a 
principle the public doubted as a response to violence; he needed to prove 
his mettle and manliness by ordering the use of force. 
The pressure on Wilson was strong, and before the month was out, 
with the approval of the Carranza govemment, he sent an army of ten 
thousand soldiers to capture Pancbo Villa. The venture was called the 
Punitive Expedition, and its leader was the dashing General John J. Persh­
ing, who had defeated guerrillas in the Philippines and Native Americans 
in the American Southwe st. Certainly Pershing could find and overpower 
Pancho Villa. 
The Punitive Expedition became a sensational story, and carloads of 
U.S. reporters followed Pershing into action. The campaign, they wrote, 
would be a test of American power. The soldiers carried the latest in 
weaponry, communicated by radio, and were supported by reconnais­
sance from the air. 
In the first few months, the troops split up into small units to comb the 
wilds of northem Mexico. The Americans offered a $50,000 reward for in­
formation leading to Villa's capture . But the Mexican people, who had 
been disillusioned with Villa when he had retumed to banditry, now idol­
ized hirn for facing this mighty American army. They began to give Persh­
ing false leads: Villa had been seen in this village, or in that mountain 
hideaway, airplanes would be dispatc bed, troops would scurry after them, 
and no one would ever see hirn. The wily bandit seemed to be always one 
step ahead of the American military. 
By the summer of that year, the expedition had swelled to 123,000 
men. They suffered through the stultifying heat, the mosquit oes, the wild 
terrain. Trudging over a countryside in which they were already resented, THE FOX A'il )

into the ministry build-

302 LAW 36 they infuriated both the local people and the Mexican government. At one 
point Pancho Villa hid in a mountain cave to recover from a gunshot 
wound he received in a skirmish with the Mexican army; looking down 
from his aerie, he could watch Pershing lead the exhausted American 
troops back and forth across the mountain s, never getting any closer to 
their goal. 
All the way into winter, Villa played his cat-and-mouse game, Ameri­
cans came to see the affair as a kind of slapstick farce-in fact they began to 
admire Villa again, respect ing his resourcefulness in eluding a superior 
force_ In January of 1917, Wilson finally ordered Pershing's withdrawal. As 
the troops made their way back to American territory, rebel forces pursued 
them, forcing the US. Army to use airplan es to protect its rear flanks. The 
Punitive Expedition was being punished itself-it had turned into a retreat 
of the most humiliating sort. 
Interpretation 
Woodrow Wilson organized the Punitive Expedition as a show of force: He 
would teach Pancho Villa a lesson and in the process show the world that 
no one, large or small, could attack the mighty United States and get away 
with it. The expedition would be over in a few weeks, and Villa would be 
forgotten. 
That was not how it played out. The longer the expedition took, the 
more it focused attention on the Americans' incompetence and on Villa's 
cleverness_ Soon what was forgotten was not Villa but the raid that had 
started it all. As a minor annoyance became an international embarrass­
ment, and the enraged Americans dispatched more troops, the imbalance 
between the size of the pursuer and the size of the pursued -who still man­
aged to stay free-made the affair a joke. And in the end this white eIe­
phant of an army had to lumber out of Mexico, humiliate d. The Punitive 
Expedition did the opposite of what it set out to do: It left Villa not only 
free but more popular than ever. 
What could Wilson have done differently? He could have pressured 
the Carranza government to catch Villa for him_ Alternatively, since many 
Mexicans had tired of Villa before the Punitive Expedition began, he could 
have worked quietly with them and won their support for a much smaller 
raid to capture the bandit. He could have organized a trap on the Ameri­
can side of the border, anticipating the next raid. Or he could have ignored 
the matter altogether for the time being, waiting for the Mexicans them­
selves to do away with Villa of their own accord. 
Remember: You choose to let things bother you_ You can just as easily 
choose not to notice the irritating offender, to consider the matter trivial 
and unworthy of your interest. That is the powerful move. What you do 
not react to cannot drag you down in a futile engage ment. Your pride is not 
involved. The best lesson you can teach an irritating gnat is to consign it to 
oblivion by ignoring it. If it is impossible to ignore (Pancho Villa had in fact 
killed American citizens), then conspire in secret to do away with it, but 
never inadvertently draw attention to the bothersome insect that will go 
away or die on its own. If you waste time and energy in such entangle­
ments, it is your own fault. Learn to play the card of disdain and turn your 
back on what cannot harm you in the long run.

OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW 
In the year 1527, King Henry VIII of England decided he had to find a 
way to get rid of his wife, Catherine of Aragon. Catherine had failed to pro­
duce a son, a male heir who would ensure the continuance of his dynasty, 
and Henry thought he knew why: He had read in the Bible the passage, 
"And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath 
uncovered his brother 's nakedness; they shall be childless." Before marry­
ing Henry, Catherine had married his older brother Arthur, but Arthur 
had died five months later. Henry had waited an appropriate time, then 
had married his brother' s widow. 
Catherine was the daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of 
Spain, and by marrying her Henry had kept alive a valuable alliance. Now, 
however, Catherine had to assure hirn that her brief marriage with Arthur 
had never been consummate d. Otherw ise Henry would view their rela­
tionship as incestuous and their marriage as null and void. Catherine in­
sisted that she had remained a virgin through her marriage to Arthur, and 
Pope Clement VII supported her by giving his blessing to the union, which 
he could not have done had he considered it incestuous. Yet after years of 
marriage to Henry, Catherine had failed to produce a son, and in the early 
1520s she had entered menopause. To the king this could only mean one 
thing: She had lied about her virginity, their union was incestuous, and 
God had punished them. 
There was another reason why Henry wanted to get rid of Catherin e: 
He had fallen in love with a younger woman, Anne Boleyn. Not only was 
he in love with her, but if he married her he could still hope to sire a legiti­
mate son. The marriage to Catherine had to be annulled. For this, how­
ever, Henry had to apply to the Vatican. But Pope Clement would never 
annul the marriage . 
By the summer of 1527, rumors spread throughout Europe that Henry 
was about to attempt the impossible -to annul his marriage against 
Clement' s wishes. Catherine would never abdicate, let alone voluntarily 
enter a nunnery, as Henry had urged her. But Henry had his own strategy: 
He stopped sleeping in the same bed with Catherin e, since he considered 
her his sister-in-Iaw, not his lawful wife. He insisted on calling her Princess the dais where the chief 
was seated and lay 
there, chewing its cud.

this was some grave

has no discrimination. 
It has legs-there is

does not make sense to 
deprive an underpaid 
official of the wretched 
ox he needs in order to 
attend court." He 
returned the ox to its 
owner and changed the 
maUing on which it had 
lain. No untoward 
event of any kind 
occurred afterward.

ished her from court and shipped her off to a distant castle. The pope or­
dered rum to return her to court, on pain of excommunication, the most 
severe penalty a Catholic could suffer. Henry not only ignored this threat, 
he insisted that his marriage to Catherine had been dissolved, and in 1533 
he married Anne Boleyn. 
Clement refused to recognize the marriage, but Henry did not care. 
He no longer recognized the pope's authority, and proceeded to break 
with the Roman Catholic Church, establishing the Church of England in 
its stead, with the king as the head of the new church. And so, not surpris­
ingly, the newly formed Church of England proclaimed Anne Boleyn Eng­
land's rightful queen. 
The pope tried every threat in the book, but nothing worked. Henry 
simply ignored him . Clement fumed-no one had ever treated him so con­
temptuously. Henry had humiliated hirn and he had no power of recourse. 
Even excommunication (which he constantly threaten ed but never carried 
out) would no longer matter. 
Catherine too feit the devastating sting of Henry' s disdain. She tried to 
fight back, but in appealing to Henry her words fell on deaf ears, and soon 
they fell on no one's. Isolated from the court, ignored by the king, mad 
with anger and frustrati on, Catherine slowly deteriorate d, and finally died 
in January of 1536, from a cancerous tumor ofthe heart. 
Interpretation 
When you pay attention to aperson, the two of you become partners of 
sorts, each moving in step to the actions and reactions of the other. In the 
process you lose your initiativ e. It is a dynamic of all interactio ns: By ac­
knowledging other people, even if only to fight with them, you open your­
self to their influence. Had Henry locked horns with Catherine, he would 
have found hirnself mired in endless arguments that would have weakened 
his resolve and eventua lly worn rum down. (Catherine was a strong, stub­
born woman.) Had he set out to convince Clement to change rus verdict on 
the marriage 's validity, or tried to compromise and negotiate with hirn, he 
would have gotten bogged down in Clement's favorite tactic: playing for 
time, promising flexibility, but actually getting what popes always got­
their way. 
Henry would have none of this. He played a devastating power 
game-total disdain. By ignoring people you cancel them out. This unset­
tles and infuriates them-but since they have no dealings with you, there is 
no thing they can do. 
This is the offensive aspect of the law. Playing the card of contempt is 
immensely powerful, for it lets you determine the conditions of the conflict. 
The war is waged on your terms. This is the ultimate power pose: You are 
the king, and you ignore what offends you. Watch how this tactic infuriates 
people -half of what they do is to get your attention, and when you with­
hold it from them, they flounder in frustration.

KEYS TO POWER 
Desire often creates paradoxical effects: The more you want somet hing, 
the more you chase after it, the more it eludes you. The more interest you 
show, the more you repel the object of your desire. This is because your in­
terest is too strong-it makes people awkward, even fearful. Uncontrol­
lable desire makes you seem weak, unworthy, pathetic. 
You need to turn YOUf back on what you want, show your contempt 
and disdain. This is the kind of powerful response that will drive your tar­
gets crazy. They will respond with adesire of their own, which is simply to 
have an effect on you-perhaps to possess you, perhaps to hurt you. If they 
want to possess you, you have successfully completed the first step of se­
duction. If they want to hurt you, you have unsettled them and made them 
play by your rules (see Laws 8 and 39 on baiting people into action). 
Contempt is the prerogative of the king. Where his eyes turn, what he 
decides to see, is what has reality; what he ignores and turns his back on is 
as good as dead. That was the weapon of King Louis XIV -if he did not 
like you, he acted as if you were not there, maintaining his superiority by 
cutting off the dynamic of interaction. This is the power you have when 
you play the card of contempt, periodically showing people that you can 
do without them. 
If choosing to ignore enhances your power, it follows that the opposite 
approach-c ommitment and engagement-often weakens you. By paying 
undue attention to a puny enemy, you look puny, and the longer it takes 
you to crush such an enemy, the larger the enemy seems. When Athens set 
out to conquer the island of Sicily, in 415 B.C., a giant power was attacking a 
tiny one. Yet by entangling Athens in a long-drawn- out conflict, Syracuse, 
Sicily's most important city-state, was ahle to grow in stature and confi­
deuce. Finally defeating Athens, it made itself famous for centuries to 
corne. In recent times, President John F. Kennedy made a similar mistake 
in his attitude to Fidel Castro of Cuha: His failed invasion at the Bay of 
Pigs, in 1961, made Castro an international hero. 
A second danger: If you succeed in crushing the irritant, or even if you 
merely wound it, you create sympathy for the weaker side. Critics of 
Franklin D. Roosevelt complained bitterly about the money his adminis­
tration spent on government projects, hut their attacks had no resonance 
with the puhlic, who saw the president as working to end the Great De­
pression. His opponents thought they had an example that would show just 
how wasteful he had hecome: his dog, Fala, which he Iavished with favors 
and attention. Critics railed at his insensitivity-spending taxpayers' 
money on a dog while so many Americans were still in poverty. But Roo­
sevelt had a response: How dare his critics attack a defenseless Httle dog? As some make gossip

It is tempting to want to fix our mistakes, but the harder we try, the 
worse we often make them, It is sometimes more politic to leave them 
alone, In 1971, when the New lOrk Times publishe d the Pentagon Papers, a 
group of government documents about the history of U.S, involvement in 
Indochina, Henry Kissinger erupted into a volcanic rage, Furious about the 
Nixon administrat ion's vulnerability to this kind of damaging leak, he 
made recommendations that eventually led to the formation of a group 
called the Plumbers to plug the leaks. This was the unit that later broke into 
Democratic Party offices in the Watergate Hotel, setting off the chain of 
events that led to Nixon's downfall. In reality the publication of the Penta­
gon Papers was not a serious threat to the administration, but Kissinger's 
reaction made it a big deal. In trying to fix one problem, he created an­
other: a paranoia for security that in the end was much more destruct ive to 
the government Had he ignored the Pentagon Papers, the scandal they 
had created would eventually have blown over, 
Instead of inadvertently focusing attention on a problem, making it 
seem worse by publicizing how much concern and anxiety it is causing 
you, it is often far wiser to play the contemptuous aristocrat, not deigning 
to ackn owledge the problem's existence, There are several ways to execute 
this strategy. 
First there is the sour-gra pes approach. If there is something you want 
but that you realize you cannot have, the worst thing you can do is draw at­
tention to your disappointrnent by complaining about it An infinitely 
more powerful tactic is to act as if it never really interested you in the first 
place. When the writer George Sand's supporters nominated her to be the 
first female member of the Academie Fran(,:aise, in 1861, Sand quickly saw 
that the academy would never admit her. Instead of whining, though, she 
claimed she had no interest in belong ing to this group of worn-out, over­
rated, out-of-touch windbags. Her disdain was the perfect response: Had 
she shown her anger at her exclusion, she would have revealed how much 
it meant to her. Instead she branded the academy a club of old men-and 
why should she be angry or disappointed at not having to spend her time 
with them? Crying "sour grapes" is sometimes seen as a reflection of the 
weak; it is actually the tactic of the powerful. 
Second, when you are attacked by an inferior, deflect people's atten­
tion by making it clear that the attack has not even registered. Look away, 
or answer sweetly, showing how little the attack concerns you. Similarly, 
when you yourself have committed ablunder, the best response is often to 
make less of your mistake by treating it lightly. 
The Japanese emperor Go-Saiin, a great disciple of the tea ceremony, 
owned a priceless antique tea bowl that all the courtiers envied. One day a 
guest, Dainagon Tsunehiro, asked if he could carry the tea bowl into the 
light, to examine it more closely. The bowl rarely left the table, but the em­
peror was in good spirits and he consented. As Dainagon carried the bowl 
to the railing of the verandah, however, and held it up to the light, it 
slipped from his hands and fell on a rock in the garden below, smashing 
into tiny fragm ents. 
The emperor of course was furious. "It was indeed most clumsy of me 
to let it drop in this way, " said Dainagon, with a deep bow, "but really 
there is not much harm done. This Ido tea-bowl is a very old one and it is 
impossible to say how much longer it would have lasted, but anyh ow it is 
not a thing of any public use, so I think it rather fortunate that it has broken 
thus ." This surprising response had an immediate effect: The emperor 
calmed down. Dainagon neither sniveled nor overa pologized, but signa led 
his own worth and power by treating his mistake with a touch of disdain. 
The emperor had to respond with a similar aristocratic indifference; his 
anger had made hirn seem low and petty-an image Dainagon was able to 
manipulate . 
Among equals this tactic might backfire : Your indifference could make 
you seem callous. Eut with a master, if you act quickly and without great 
fuss, it can work to great effect: You bypass his angry response, save hirn 
the time and energy he would waste by brooding over it, and allow hirn the 
opportunity to display his own lack of pettin ess publicly. 
If we make excuses and denials when we are caught in am istake or a 
decepti on, we stir the waters and make the situation worse. It is often wiser 
to play things the opposite way. The Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino 
often boasted of his aristocrati c linea ge, which was, of course, a fiction, 
since he was actually the son of a shoem aker. When an enemy of his finally 
reve aled the embarrassing truth , word quickly spread, and soon all of 
Venice (where he lived at the time) was aghast at Aretino's lies. Had he 
tried to defend hirnself , he would have only dragge d hirnself down. His re­
sponse was master ful: He announced that he was indeed the son of a shoe­
maker, but this only proved his great ness, since he had risen from the 
lowest stratum of society to its very pinnacl e. From then on he never men­
tioned his previous lie, trumpeting instead his new position on the matter 
of his ance stry. 
Rememb er: The powerful responses to niggling, petty annoyances and 
irrita tions are contempt and disdain. Never show that something has af­
fected you, or that you are offended -that only shows you have acknowl­
edged a problem. Contempt is a dish that is best served cold and with out 
affectati on.

Authority : Know how to play the card of contempt. It is the most pohtic 
kind of revenge. For there are many of whom we should have known 
no thing if their distinguished opponents had taken no notice of them. 
There is no revenge hke oblivion, for it is the entombment of the unwOf­
thy in the dust of their own nothingne ss. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) 
REVE RSAL 
You must play the card of contempt with care and delicacy. Most small 
troubles will vanish on their own if you leave them be; but some will grow 
and fester unless you attend to them. Ignore a person of inferior stature and 
the next time you look he has become a serious rival, and your contempt 
has made hirn vengeful as weIl. The great princes of Renaissance Italy 
chose to ignore Cesare Borgia at the outset of his career as a young general 
in the army of his father, Pope Alexander VI. By the time they paid atten­
tion it was too late-the cub was now a hon, gobbling up chunks of Italy. 
Often, then, while you show contempt publicly you will also need to keep 
an eye on the problem privately, monitoring its status and making sure it 
goes away. Do not let it become a cancerous cello 
Develop the skill of sensing problems when they are still small and 
taking care of them before they become intracta ble. Learn to distinguish 
between the potentially disastrous and the mildly irritating, the nuisance 
that will quietly go away on its own. In either case, though, never com­
pletely take your eye off it. As long as it is alive it can smolder and spark

In the early 1780s, word spread through Berlin of the strange and spectacu­
lar medical practice of a Dr. Weisleder. He performed his miracles in an 
enormous converted beer hall, outside which Berliners began to notice 
ever longer lines of people-the blind, the lame, anyone with an illness in­
curable by normal medici ne. When it leaked out that the doctor worked by 
exposing the patient to the rays of the mo on, he soon became dubbed The 
Moon Doctor of Berlin. 
Sometime in 1783, it was reported that Dr. Weisleder had cured a well­
to-do woman of a terrible ailment. He suddenly became a celebrity. Previ­
ously only the poorest Berliners had been seen waiting outside the beer 
hall in their rags; now magnificent carriages were parked outside, and gen­
tlemen in frock coats, and ladies with enormous coiffures, lined the street 
as sunset drew near. Even folk with the mildest of ailments came, out of 
sheer curiosity. As they waited in line, the poorer clients would explain to 
the gentlemen and ladies that the doctor only practiced when the moon 
was in its incre scent phase. Many would add that they themselves had al­
ready been exposed to the healing powers he called forth from the rays of 
the moon. Even those who feIt cured kept coming back, drawn by this 
powerful experie nce. 
Inside the beer hall, astrange and stirring spectacle greeted the visitor: 
Packed into the entrance hall was a crowd of all classes and ethnic back­
grounds, a veritable Tower of Babel. Through tall windows on the northern 
side of the hall, silvery moonlight poured in at odd angles. The doctor and 
his wife, who, it seemed, was also able to effect the cure, practiced on the 
second floor, which was reached by a stairway, at the end of the hall. As the 
line edged closer to the stairs, the sick would hear shouts and cries from 
above, and word would spread of, perhaps, a blind gentleman suddenly 
able to see. 
Once upstairs, the line would fork in two directio ns, toward a north­
em room for the doctor, a southem one for his wife, who worked only on 
the ladies. Finally, after hours of anticipation and waiting in line, the gen­
tlemen patients would be led before the amazing doctor hirnself, an el­
derly man with a few stalks of wild gray hair and an air of nervous energy. 
He would take the patient (let us say a young boy, brought in by his fa­
ther), uncover the afflicted body part, and lift the boy up to the window, 
which faced the light of the moon. He would rub the site of the injury or 
illness, mumble something unintellig ible, look knowingly at the mo on, 
and then, after collecting his fee, send the boy and his father on their way. 
Meanwhil e, in the south-facing room, his wife would be doing the same 
with the ladies-which was odd, really, since the moon cannot appear in 
two places at once; it cannot have been visible, in other words, from both 
windows. Apparently the mere thought, idea, and symbol of the moon 
were enough, for the ladies did not complain, and would later remark 
confidently that the wife of the Moon Doctor had the same healing powers 
as he. 
Interpretation 
Dr. Weisleder may have known nothing about medicine , but he under­
stood human nature. Re recognized that people do not always want words, 
or rational explanat ions, or demonstrations of the powers of science; they 
want an immediate appeal to their emotions. Give them that and they will 
do the rest-such as imagine they can be healed by the light reflected from 
a rock a quarter million miles away. Dr. Weisleder had no need of pills, or 
oflengthy lectures on the moon's power, or of any silly gadgetry to amplify 
its rays. Re understood that the simpler the spectacle the better-just the 
moonlight pouring in from the side, the stairway leading to the heavens, 
and the rays of the mo on, whether directly visible or not. Any added ef­
fects might have made it seem that the moon was not strong enough on its 
own. And the moon was strong enough-it was a magnet far fantasies, as it 
has been throughout history. Simply by associa ting hirnself with the image 
of the moon, the doctor gained power. 
Remember: Your search for power depends on shortcu ts. You must al­
ways circumvent people's suspicions, their perverse desire to resist your 
will. Images are an extremely effective shortcut: Bypassing the head, the 
seat of doubt and resistance, they aim straight for the heart. Overwhelming 
the eyes, they create powernd associations, bringing people together and 
stirring their emotions. With the white light of the moon in their eyes, your 
targets are blinded to the deceptions you practice. 
OBSER VANCE OF TRE LAW 11 
In 1536 the future king Renri 11 of France took his first mistress, Diane de 
Poitiers. Diane was thirty-seven at the time, and was the widow of the 
grand seneschal of Normandy. Renri, meanwhile, was a sprightly lad of 
seventeen, who was just beginning to sow his wild oats. At first their union 
seemed merely platonic, with Renri showing an intensely spiritual devo­
tion to Diane. But it so on became clear that he loved her in every way, pre­
ferring her bed to that of his young wife, Catherine de' Medicis. 
In 1547 King Francis died and Renri ascended to the throne. This new 
situation posed perils for Diane de Poitiers. She had just tumed forty-eight, 
and despite her notorious cold baths and rumored youth potions, she was 
beginning to show her age; now that Renri was king, perhaps he would re­
turn to the queen's bed, and do as other kings had done--choose mis­
tresses from the bevy of beauties who made the French court the envy of 
Europe. Re was, after all, only twenty-eight, and cut a dashing figure. But 
Diane did not give up so easily. She would continue to enthrall her lover, 
as she had enthralled hirn for the past eleven years. 
Diane's secret weapons were symbols and images, to which she had al­
ways paid great attention. Early on in her relationship with Renri, she had 
created a motif by intertwining her initials with his, to symbolize their 
union. The idea worked like acharm: Renri put this insignia everywhere-­
on his royal robes, on monuments , on churches, on the facade of the where Antony awaited 
the queen enthroned on 
his tribunal, unti! at last 
he was left sitting quite 
alone. And the word 
spread on every side 
that Aphrodite had 
come to revel with 
Dionysus for the 
happiness of Asia. 
Antony then sent a 
message inviting 
Cleopatra to dine with 
him. But she thought it 
more appropriate that 
he should come to her, 
and so, as he wished to 
show his courtesy and 
goodwill, he accepted 
and went. He found the 
preparations made to 
receive him magnificent 
bey(md words, but 
what astonished him 
most of all was the 
extraordinary number 
of lights. 50 many of 
these, it is said, were let

THE WANING OF THE 
MIDDLE AGES,

312 LAW 37 Louvre, then the royal palace in PariS. Diane's favorite colors were black 
and white, which she wore exclusively, and wherever it was possible the in­
signia appeared in these colors. Everyone recognized the symbol and its 
meaning. Soon after Renri took the throne, however, Diane went still fur­
ther: She decided to identify herself with the Roman goddess Diana, her 
namesake. Diana was the goddess of the hunt, the traditional royal pastime 
and the particular passion of Renri. Equally important, in Renaissance art 
she symbolized chastity and purity. For a woman like Diane to identify her­
self with this goddess would instantly call up those images in the court, giv­
ing her an air of respectability. Symbolizing her "chaste" relationship with 
Renri, it would also set her apart from the adulterous liaisons of royal mis­
tresses past. 
To effect this association, Diane began by completely transforming her 
castle at Anet. She razed the building's structure and in its place erected a 
magnificent Doric-colum ned edifice modeled after a Roman temple. It was 
made in white Normandy stone flecked with black silex, reproducing 
Diane's trademark colors of black and white. The insignia of her and 
Renri's initials appeared on the columns, the doors, the windows, the car­
pet. Meanwhile, symbols of Diana-crescent moons, stags, and hounds­
adorned the gates and facade. Inside, enormous tapestries depicting 
episodes in the life of the goddess lay on the floors and hung on the walls. 
In the garden stood the famous Goujon sculpture Diane Chasseresse, which is 
now in the Louvre, and which had an uncanny resemblance to Diane de 
Poitiers. Paintings and other depictions of Diana appeared in every corner 
of the castle. 
Anet overwhelmed Renri, who soon was trumpeting the image of 
Diane de Poitiers as a Roman goddess. In 1548, when the couple appeared 
together in Lyons for a royal celebration, the townspeople welcomed them 
with a tableau vivant depicting a scene with Diana the huntress. France's 
greatest poet of the period, Pierre de Ronsard, began to write verses in 
honor of Diana-indeed a kind of cult of Diana sprang up, all inspired by 
the king's mistress. It seemed to Renri that Diane had given herself a kind 
of divine aura, and as if he were destined to worship her for the rest of his 
life. And until his death, in 1559, he did remain faithful to her-making her 
a duchess, giving her untold wealth, and displaying an almost religious de­
votion to his first and only mistress. 
Interpretation 
Diane de Poitiers, a woman from a modest bourgeois background, man­
aged to captivate Renri for over twenty years. By the time he died she was 
weH into her sixties, yet his passion for her only increased with the years. 
She knew the king well. Re was not an inteHectual but a lover of the out­
doors-he particularly loved jousting tournaments, with their bright pen­
nants, brilliantly caparisoned horses, and beautifully dressed women. 
Renri's love of visual splendor seemed childlike to Diane, and she played 
on this weakness of his at every opportunity. 
Most astute of all was Diane's appropriation of the goddess Diana. 
Here she took the game beyond physical imagery into the realm of the psy­
chic symbol. It was quite a feat to transform a king's mistress into an em­
blem of power and purity, but she managed it. Without the resonance of 
the goddess, Diane was merely anaging courtesan. With the imagery and 
symbolism of Diana on her shoulders, she seemed a mythic force, destined 
for greatness. 
You too can play with images like these, weaving visual clues into an 
encompassing gestalt, as Diane did with her colors and her insignia. Estab­
lish a trademark like these to set yourself apart. Then take the game fur­
ther: Find an image or symbol from the past that will neatly fit your 
situation, and put it on your shoulders like a cape. It will make you seem 
larger than life. 
Because of the light it shines on the other stars which make up a kind of 
court around it, because of the just and equal distr ibution of its mys to 
alt alike, because of the good it bring s to alt places, producing life, joy 
and action, because of its cons tancy from which it never varies, I chose 
the sun as the most magnifi cent image to repres ent a great leader.

KEYS TO POWER 
Using words to plead your case is risky business: Words are dangerous in­
struments, and often go astray. The words people use to persuade us virtu­
ally invite us to reflect on them with words of our OWO; we mull them over, 
and often end up believing the opposite of what they say. (That is part of 
our perverse nature.) It also happens that words offend us, stirring up asso­
ciations unintended by the speaker. 
The visual, on the other hand, short-circuits the labyrinth of words. It 
strikes with an emotional power and immediacy that leave no gaps for re­
flection and doubt. Like music, it leaps right over rational, reasonable 
thoughts. Imagine the Moon Doctor trying to make a case for his medical 
practice, trying to convince the unconverted by telling them about the 
healing powers of the moon, and about his owo special connection to a dis­
tant object in the sky. Fortunately for hirn, he was able to create a com­
pelling spectacle that made words unneces sary. The moment his patients 
entered the beer hall, the image of the moon spoke eloquently enough. 
Understand: Words put you on the defensi ve. If you have to explain 
yourself your power is already in question. The image, on the other hand, 
imposes itself as a given. It discourages questio ns, creates forcehll associa ­
tions, resists unintended interpreta tions, communicates instantly, and 
forges bonds that transcend social differences. Words stir up arguments 
and divisions; images bring people together. They are the quintessential in­
struments of power. 
The symbol has the same force, whether it is visual (the statue of There was a man

314 LAW 37 Diana) or a verbal description of something visual (the words "the Sun 
King"). The symbolic object stands for something else, something abstract 
(such as the image "Diana" standing for chastity). The abstract concept­
purity, patriotism, courage, love-is full of emotional and powerful associa­
tions. The symbol is a shortcut of expression, containing dozens of 
meanings in one simple phrase or object. The symbol of the Sun King, as 
explained by Louis XIV, can be read on many layers, but the beauty of it is 
that its associations required no explanation, spoke immediately to his sub­
jects, distinguished him from allother kings, and conjured up a kind of 
majesty that went far beyond the words themselves. The symbol contains 
untold power. 
The first step in using symbols and images is to understand the pri­
macy of sight among the senses. Before the Renaissance, it has been ar­
gued, sight and the other senses-taste, touch, and so on-operated on a 
relatively equal plane. Since then, however, the visual has come to domi­
nate the others, and is the sense we most depend on and trust. As Graciän 
said, "The truth is generally seen, rarely heard." When the Renaissance 
painter Fra Filippo Lippi was a captured slave among the Moors, he won 
his freedom by sketching a drawing of his master on a white wall with a 
piece of charcoal; when the owner saw the drawing, he instantly under­
stood the power of a man who could make such images, and let Fra Lippi 
go. That one image was far more powerful than any argument the artist 
could have made with words. 
Never neglect the way you arrange things visually. Factors like color, 
for example, have enormous symbolic resonance . When the con artist Yel­
low Kid Weil created a newsletter touting the phony stocks he was ped­
dling, he called it the "Red Letter Newsletter" and had it printed, at 
considerable expense, in red ink. The color created a sense of urgency, 
power, and good fortune. Weil recognized details like these as keys to de­
ception-as do modem advertisers and mass-market ers. If you use "gold" 
in the title of anything you are trying to sell, for example, print it in gold. 
. Since the eye predominates, people will respond more to the color than to 
theword. 
The visual contains great emotional power. The Roman emperor Con­
stantine worshipped the sun as a god for most of his life; one day, though, 
he looked up at the sun, and saw a cross superimp osed on it. The vision of 
the cross over the sun proved to hirn the ascendancy of the new religion, 
and he converted not just hirnself but the whole Roman Empire to Chris­
tianity soon thereafter. All the preaching and proselytizing in the world 
could not have been as powerful . Find and associate yourself with the im­
ages and symbols that will communicate in this immediate way today, and 
you will have untold power. 
Most effective of all is a new combination-a fusion of images and sym­
bols that have not been seen together before, but that through their associ­
ation clearly demonstrate your new idea, message, religion. The creation of 
new images and symbols out of old ones in this way has a poetic effect­
viewers' associations run rampant, giving them a sense of participat ion. 
Visual images often appear in a sequence, and the order in which they 
appear creates a symbol. The first to appear, for instance, symboliz es 
power; the image at the center seems to have central importance. 
Near the end of World War 11, orders came down from General Eisen­
hower that American troops were to lead the way into Paris after its liber­
ation from the Nazis. The French general Charles de Gaulle, however, 
realized that this sequence would imply that the Americans now com­
manded the fate of France. Through much manipulation, de Gaulle made 
certain that he and the French Second Armored Division would appear at 
the head of the liberating force. The strategy worked: After he had success­
fuHy pulled off this stunt, the Allies started treating hirn as the new leader 
of an independent France. De Gaulle knew that aleader has to locate him­
self literally at the head of his troops. This visual association is crucial to the 
emotional response that he needs to elicit. 
Things change in the game of symbols: It is probably no longer possi­
ble to pose as a "sun king," or to wrap the mantIe of Diana around you. Yet 
you can associate yourself with such symbols more indirectIy. And, of 
course, you can make your own mythology out of figures from more re­
cent history, people who are comfortably dead but still powerfully associa­
tive in the public eye. The idea is to give yourself an aura, astature that 
your normal banal appearance simply will not create. By herself Diane de 
Poitiers had no such radiant powers; she was as human and ordinary as 
most of uso But the symbol elevated her above the human lot, and made 
her seem divine. 
Using symbols also has a courtier-like effect, since they are often gen­
tIer than brutish words. The psychotherapist Dr. Milton H. Erickson al­
ways tried to find symbols and images that would communicate to the 
patient in ways that words could not. When dealing with a severely trou­
bied patient, he would not question hirn directIy but would talk about 
something irrelevant, such as driving through the desert in Arizona, where 
he practiced in the 1950s. In describing this he would eventually come to 
an appropriate symbol for what he suspected was the man's problem. Ifhe 
feIt the patient was isolated, say, Dr. Erickson would talk of a single iron­
wood tree, and how its isolation left it battered by the winds. Making an 
emotional connection with the tree as a symbol, the patient would open up 
more readily to the doctor's probing. 
Use the power of symbols as a way to rally, animate, and unite your 
troops or team. During the rebellion against the French crown in 1648, 
those loyal to the king disparaged the rebels by comparing them to the 
slingshots (in French,frondes) that littIe boys use to frighten big boys. Cardi­
nal de Retz decided to turn this disparaging term into the rebels' symbol: 
The uprising was now known as the Fronde, and the rebels as frondeurs. 
They began to wear sashes in their hats that symbolized the slingshot, and 
the word became their rallying cry. Without it the rebellion might weIl 
have petered out. Always find a symbol to represent your cause-the more 
emotional associations, the better. 
The best way to use images and symbols is to organize them into a 
LAW 37 315 
316 LAW 37 grand spectacle that awes people and distracts them from unpleasant reali­
ties. This is easy to do: People love what is grand, spectacular, and larger

818 LAW 38 TRAN SGRESSION OF THE LAW 
Around the year 478 B.C., the city of Sparta sent an expedition to Persia led 
by the young Spartan nobleman Pau sanias. The city-states of Greece had 
recently fought off a mighty invasion from Persia, and now Pausanias, 
along with alli ed ships from Athens, had orders to punish the invaders and 
win back the islands and coastal towns that the Persians had occupied. 
Both the Athenians and the Spartans had great respect for Pau sani as-he 
had proven hirnself as a fearless warr ior, with a flair for the dramatic. 
With amazing speed, Pau sanias and his troops took Cyp rus, then 
moved on to the mainland of Asia Minor known as the Helle spont and 
captured Byzantium (modem-day Istanbul) . Now master of part of the Per­
sian empire, Pausanias began to show signs of behavior that went beyond 
his normal flamboyance . He appeared in public wearing pomades in his 
hair and flowing Persian robes, and accompanied by a bodyguard of Egyp­
tians. He held lavish banquets in which he sat in the Persian manner and 
demanded to be entertain ed. He stopped seeing his old friends, entered 
into communication with the Persian King Xerxes, and all in all affected 
the style and manner of a Persian dictator. 
Clearly power and success had gone to Pau sanias 's head. His army­
Athenians and Spartans alike-at first thought this a passing fancy: He had 
always been a bit exaggerated in his gesture s. But when he flaunted his dis­
dain for the Greeks' simple way of life, and insulted the common Greek 
soldier, they began to feel he had gone too far. Although there was no con­
crete evidence for this, rumors spread that he had gone over to the other 
side, and that he dreamed of becoming a kind of Greek Xerxes. To quell 
the pos sibility of mutiny, the Spartans relieved Pau sanias of his command 
and called hirn horne. 
Pau sanias , however, continued to dress in the Persian style, even in 
Sparta. After a few months he independently hired a trireme and retumed 
to the Helle spont, telling his compatriots he was going to continue the fight 
against the Persians. Actuall y, however, he had different plans-to make 
hirnself ruler of all Greece, with the aid of Xerxes hirnself. The Spartans 
dedared hirn a public enemy and sent a ship to capture hi rn. Pau sanias sur­
rendered, certain that he could dear hirnself of the charges of treason. It 
did come out during the trial that during his reign as commander he had 
offended his fellow Greeks time and agai n, erecting monuments , for in­
stance, in his own name, rather than in those of the cities whose troops had 
fought alongside hirn, as was the custom. Yet Pausanias proved right: De­
spite the evidence of his numerous contacts with the enemy, the Spartans 
refused to imprison a man of such noble birth, and let hirn go. 
Now thinking hirnself untouchable, Pausanias hired a messenger to 
take a letter to Xerxes, but the messenger instead took the letter to the 
Spartan authorities. These men wanted to find out more, so they had the 
messenger arrange to meet Pausanias in atempIe where they could hide 
and listen behind a parti tion. What Pau sanias said shocked them-they 
had never heard such contempt for their ways spoken so brazenly by one 
of their own-and they made arrangements for his immediate arrest. 
On his way horne from the temple, Pausanias got word of what had 
happened. He ran to another temple to hide, but the authorities followed 
him there and placed sentries all around. Pausanias refused to surrender. 
Unwilling to forcibly remove hirn from the sacred temple, the authorities 
kept hirn trapped inside, until he eventually died of starvation. 
Interpretation 
At first glance it might seem that Pausanias simply fell in love with another 
culture, a phenomenon as old as time. Never comfortable with the asceti­
cism of the Spartans, he found hirnself enthralled by the Persian love of 
luxury and sensual pleasure. He put on Persian robes and perfumes with a 
sense of deliverance from Greek discipline and simplicity. 
This is how it appears when people adopt a culture in which they were 
not raised. Often, however, there is also something else at play: People 
who flaunt their infatuation with a different culture are expressing a dis­
dain and contempt for their own. They are using the outward appearance 
of the exotic to separate themselves from the common folk who unques­
tioningly follow the local customs and laws, and to express their sense of 
superiority. Otherwise they would act with more dignity, showing respect 
for those who do not share their desires. Indeed their need to show their 
difference so dramatically often makes them disliked by the people whose 
beliefs they challenge, indirectly and subtly, perhaps, but offensively 
nonetheless. 
As Thucydides wrote of Pausanias, "By his contempt for the laws and 
his imitation of foreign ways he had made hirnself very widely suspected of 
being unwilling to abide by normal standards." Cultures have norms that 
reflect centuries of shared beliefs and ideals. Do not expect to scoff at such 
things with impunity. You will be punished somehow, even if just through 
isolation-a position of real powerlessne ss. 
Many of us, like Pausanias, feel the siren call of the exotic, the foreign. 
Measure and moderate this desire. Flaunting your pleasure in alien ways of 
thinking and acting will reveal a different motive--to demonstrate your su­
periority over your fellows. 
OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW 
During the late sixteenth century, a violent reaction against the Protestant 
Reformation erupted in Italy. The Counter-Reformation, as it was called, 
included its own version of the Inquisition to root out all deviations from 
the Catholic Church. Among its victims was the scientist Galileo, but an 
important thinker who suffered even greater persecution was the Domini­
can monk and philosopher Tommaso Campanella. 
A follower of the materia list doctrine of the Roman philosopher Epi­
cums, Campanella did not believe in miracles, or in heaven and hell. The 
Church had promoted such superstitions, he wrote, to control the common 
folk by keeping them in fear. Such ideas verged on atheism, and Cam­
panella expressed them incautiously. In 1593 the Inquisition threw hirn Bene vixit. qui bene

Once upon a time

not been specially 
hoarded, would disap­

drive men mad. 
Only one man listened

water and went to a 
secure place where he 
stored it, and waited for 
the water to change its 
character. 
On the appointed date 
the streams stopped 
running, the wells wellt 
dry, and the man who 
had listened, seeing this 
LAW 38 319 
happening, went to his 
retreat and drank his 
preserved water. 
When he saw, fram his 
security, the waterfalls 
again beginning to 
fiow, this man 
descended among the 
other sons of men. He 
found that they were 
thinking and talking in 
an entirely different 
way from before; yet 
they had no memory of 
what had happened, 
nor of having been 
warned. When he tried 
to talk to them, he real­
ized that they thought 
that he was mad, and 
they showed hostility or 
compassi on, not under­
standing. 
At first he drank none 
of the new water, but 
went back to his 
concealment, to draw 
on his supplies, every 
day. Finally, however, 
he took the decision to 
drink the new water 
because he could not 
bear the loneliness of 
living, behaving and 
thinking in a different 
way fram everyone 
else. He drank the new 
water, and became like 
the rest. Then he forgot 
all about his own store 
of special water, and 
his fellows began to 
look upon him as a 
madman who had

restored to sanity.

320 LAW 38 into prison for his heretical beliefs. Six years later, as a form of partial re­
lease, he was confined to a monastery in Naples. 
Southem Italy was controlled by Spain at the time, and in Nap les 
Campanella became involved in a plot to fight and throw out these in­
vaders. His hope was to establish an independent republic based on his 
own ideas of utopia. The leaders of the Italian Inquisition, working with 
their Spanish counterparts, had hirn imprisoned aga in. This time they also 
tortur ed hirn, to discover the true nature ofhis impious belief s: He was sub­
jected to the infa mous la veglia, a torture in which he was suspended by his 
arms in a squatting position a few inches above a seat studded with spikes. 
The posture was impossible to sustain, and in time the victim would end up 
sitting on the spikes, which would tear his flesh at the slightest contact. 
During these years, however, Campanella leamed something about 
power. Facing the prospect of execution for heresy, he changed his strat­
egy : He would not renounce his beliefs, yet he knew he had to disguise 
their outward appeara nce. 
To save his life, Campanella feigned mad ness. He let his inquisitors 
imagine that his belief s stemmed from an incontrollable unsoundness of 
mind. For a while the tortur es continu ed, to see if his insanity was faked, 
but in 1603 his sentence was commuted to life in prison. The first four 
years of this he spent cha ined to a wall in an underground dunge on. De­
spite such conditions, he continued to write--although no longer would he 
be so foolish as to express his ideas directly. 
One book of Campanella's, The Hispanic Monarchy, promoted the idea 
that Spain had a divine mission to expand its powers around the world, 
and offered the Spanish king practical, Machia velli-type adv ice for achiev­
ing this. Despite his own int erest in Machia velli, the book in general pre­
sented ideas completely the opposite to his own. The Hispanic Monarchy was 
in fact a ploy, an atte mpt to show his conversion to orthodoxy in the bold­
est manner possible. It worke d: In 1626, six years after its publication, the 
pope finally let Campanella out of prison. 
Shortly after gaining his freedom, Campanella wrote Atheism Con­
quered, a book attacking 'free-thinkers, Machiavellia ns, Calvinists, and 
heretics of all strip es. The book is written in the form of debates in which 
heretics express their belief s and are counte red by arguments for the supe­
riority of Catholic ism. Campanella had obviously reformed-his book 
made that dear. Or did it? 
The arguments in the mouths of the heretics had never before been 
expressed with such verve and freshness. Pretending to present their side 
only to knock it down, Campanella actually summarized the case against 
Catho licism with striking passion. When he argu ed the other side, suppos­
edly his side, on the other hand, he resorted to stale dicbes and convoluted 
rationa les. Brief and eloquent, the heret ics' arguments seemed bold and 
sincere . The lengthy arguments for Catholicism seemed tiresome and un­
convincing. 
Cat holics who read the book found it disturbing and ambigu ous, but 
they could not claim it was heretical, or that Campanella should be re­
tumed to prison. His defense of Catholicism, after all, used arguments they 
had used themselve s. Yet in the years to come, Atheism Conqueredbecame a 
bible for atheists, Machiavellians and libertines who used the arguments 
Campanella had put in their mouths to defend their dangerous ideas. Com­
bining an outward display of conformity with an expression of his true be­
liefs in a way that his sympathizers would understand, Campanella showed 
that he had learned his lesson. 
Interpretation 
In the face of awesome persecution, Campanella devised three strate­
gie moves that saved his hide, freed hirn from prison, and allowed hirn to 
continue to express his beliefs. First he feigned madness--the medieval 
equivalent of disavowing responsibility for one's actions, like blaming 
one's parents today. Next he wrote a book that expressed the exact oppo­
site of his own beliefs. Finally, and most brilliantly of all, he disguised his 
ideas while insinuating them at the same time. It is an old but powerful 
triek: You pretend to disagree with dangerous ideas, but in the course of 
your disagreement you give those ideas expression and exposure. You 
seem to conform to the prevailing orthodoxy, but those who know will un­
derstand the irony involved. You are protected. 
It is inevitable in society that certain values and customs lose contact 
with their original motives and become oppressive . And there will always 
be those who rebel against such oppression, harboring ideas far ahead of 
their time. As Campanella was forced to realize, however, there is no point 
in making a display of your dangerous ideas if they only bring you suffer­
ing and persecution. Martyrdom serves no purpose--better to live on in an 
oppressive world, even to thrive in it. Meanwhile find a way to express 
your ideas subtly for those who understand you. Laying your pearls before 
swine will only bring you trouble. 
For a long time I have not said wh at I believed, nOT do lever believe

KEYS TO POWER 
We all tell lies and hide our true feelings, for complete free expression is a 
sodal impossibility. From an early age we leam to conceal our thoughts, 
telling the prickly and insecure what we know they want to hear, watching 
carefully lest we offend them. For most of us this is natural-th ere are ideas 
and values that most people accept, and it is pointless to argue. We believe 
what we want to, then, but on the outside we wear a mask. 
There are people, however, who see such restraints as an intolerable 
infringement on their freedom, and who have a need to prove the superi-Never combat any 
man's opinion; for 
though you reached the 
age of Methuselah, you 
would never have done 
setting him right upon 
all the absurd things 
that he believes. 
It is also weil to avoid 
correcting people:s 
mistakes in conversa­

your intentions may be; 
for it is easy to offend 
people, and difficult, if 
not impossible to mend 
them. 
If you feel irritated by 
the absurd remarks of 
two people whose

happen to overhear, 
you should imagine 
that you are listening to 
the dialogue of two 
fools in a comedy.

322 LAW 38 ority of their valu es and beliefs . In the end, though, their arguments con­
vince only a few and offend a great deal more. The reason arguments do 
not work is that most people hold their ideas and values without thinking 
about them. There is a strong emotional content in their belief s: They re­
ally do not want to have to rework their habits of thinking, and when you 
challenge them, whether directly through your arguments or indirec tly 
through your behavior, they are hostile. 
Wise and clever people learn early on that they can display con ven­
tional behavior and mouth conventional ideas without having to believe in 
them . The power these people gain from blending in is that of being left 
alone to have the thoughts they want to have, and to express them to the 
people they want to express them to, without suff ering isola tion or os­
tracism. Once they have established themselves in a position of power, 
they can try to convince a wider circle of the correctness of their ideas-­
perhaps working indirectly, using Campa nella' s strateg ies of irony and in­
sinuati on. 
In the late fourt eenth century, the Spanish began a massive persecu­
tion of the Jews, murdering thousands and driving others out of the coun­
try. Those who remai ned in Spain were forced to convert. Yet over the next 
three hundred years, the Spanish noticed a phenomenon that disturbed 
them: Many of the converts lived their outward lives as Catholics, yet 
somehow managed to retain their Jewish beliefs, practicing the religion in 
priva te. Many of these so-called Marra nos (originally a derogatory term, 
being the Spanish for "pig") attained high levels of govemment office, mar­
ried into the nobility, and gave every appearance of Christian piety, only 
to be discovered late in life as practicing Jews. (The Spanish Inquisition 
was specifically commissioned to ferret them out.) Over the years they 
mastered the art of dissimulat ion, displaying crucifixes liberally, giving 
generous gifts to churc hes, even occasionally making anti- Semitic 
remarks-and all the while maintaining their inner freedom and beliefs. 
In society, the Marranos knew, outward appearanc es are what matter. 
This remains true today. The strategy is simple: As Campanella did in writ­
ing Atheism Conquered, make a show of bIen ding in, even going so far as to 
be the most zealous advocate of the prevailing orthodoxy. If you stick to 
conventional appearances in public few will believe you think diff erently 
in private . 
Do not be so foolish as to imagine that in our own time the old ortho­
doxies are gone. Jonas Salk, for insta nce, thought science had gotten past 
politics and protocol. And so, in his search for a polio vaccine, he broke all 
the rule s-going public with a discovery before showing it to the scientific 
community, taking credit for the vaccine without acknowledging the scien­
tists who had paved the way, making hirnself a star. The public may have 
loved hirn but scientists shun ned hirn. His disrespect for his community's 
orthodoxies left hirn isolated, and he wasted years trying to heal the 
breach, and struggling for funding and cooperation. 
Bertolt Brecht underwent a modem form of Inquisition -the House 
Un-Am erican Activiti es Committee-and approached it with considerable 
canniness. Having worked off and on in the American film industry during 
World War 11, in 1947 Brecht was summoned to appear before the commit­
tee to answer questions on his suspected Communist sympathies. Other 
writers called before the committee made a point of attacking its members, 
and of acting as belligerently as possible in order to gain sympathy for 
themselves. Brecht, on the other hand, who had actually worked stead-
. fastly for the Communist cause, played the opposite game: He answered 
questions with ambiguous generalit ies that defied easy interpretati on. Call 
it the Campanella strategy. Brecht even wore a suit-a rare event for him­
and made a point of smoking a cigar during the proceedings, knowing that 
a key committee member had a passion for cigars. In the end he charmed 
the committee members, who let hirn go scot-free. 
Brecht then moved to East Germany, where he encountered a differ­
ent kind of Inquisition. Here the Communists were in power, and they crit­
icized his plays as decadent and pessimistic. He did not argue with them, 
but made small changes in the performan ce scripts to shut them up. Mean­
while he managed to preserve the published texts as written. His outward 
conformity in both cases gave hirn the freedom to work unhindered, with­
out having to change his thinking. In the end, he made his way safely 
through dangerous times in different countries through the use of little 
dances of orthodoxy, and proved he was more powerful than the forces of 
repression. 
Not only do people of power avoid the offenses of Pausanias and Salk, 
they also leam to play the clever fox and feign the common touch. This has 
been the ploy of con artists and politicians throughout the centuries. Lead­
ers like Julius Caesar and Franklin D. Roosevelt have overcome their nat­
ural aristocratic stance to cultivate a familiarity with the common man. 
They have expressed this familiarity in little gesture s, often symbolic, to 
show the people that their leaders share popular values, despite their differ­
ent status. 
The logical extension of this practice is the invalua ble ability to be all 
things to all people. When you go into society, leave behind your own 
ideas and values, and put on the mask that is most appropriate for the 
group in which you find yourse lf. Bismarck played this game successfully 
for years-there were people who vaguely understood what he was up to, 
but not clearly enough that it mattered. People will swallow the bait be­
cause it flatters them to believe that you share their ideas. They will not 
take you as a hypocrite if you are careful-for how can they accuse you of 
hypocrisy ifyou do not let them know exactly what you stand for? Nor will 
they see you as lacking in values. Of course you have values-the values 
you share with them, while in their compan y.

326 LAW 39 TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW 
In January of 1809, an agitated and anxious Napoleon hurried back to 
Paris from his Spanish wars. His spies and confidants had confirmed a 
rumor that his foreign minister Talleyrand had conspired against hirn with 
Fouche, the minister of police. Immedia telyon arriving in the capital the 
shocked emperor summoned his ministers to the palace. Following them 
into the meeting right after their arrival, he began pacing up and down, 
and started rambling vaguely about plotters working against hirn, specula­
tors bringing down the stock market, legislators delaying his policies-and 
his own ministers undermining hirn, 
As Napoleon talked, Talleyrand leaned on the mantelpiece, looking 
completely indifferent. Facing Talleyrand directly, Napoleon announced, 
"For these ministers, treason has begun when they permit themselves to 
doubt." At the word "treason" the ruler expected his minister to be afraid, 
But Talleyrand only smiled, calm and bored. 
The sight of a subordinate apparently serene in the face of charges that 
could get hirn hanged pushed Napoleon to the edge. There were ministers, 
he said, who wanted hirn dead, and he took a step doser to Talleyrand­
who stared back at hirn unfazed. Finally Napoleon exploded. "You are a 
coward," he screamed in Talleyrand's face, "a man of no faith. Nothing is 
sacred to you. You would sell your own father. 1 have showered you with 
riches and yet there is nothing you would not do to hurt me." The other 
ministers looked at each other in disbelief-they had never seen this fear­
less general, the conqueror of most of Europe, so unhinged. 
"You deserve to be broken like glass," Napoleon continued, stamping, 
"I have the power to do it, but 1 have too much contempt for you to bother. 
Why didn't 1 have you hanged from the gates of the Tuileries? But there is 
still time for that." Yelling, almost out of breath, his face red, his eyes 
bulging, he went on, "You, by the way, are nothing but shit in a silk stock­
ing .. , . What about your wife? You never told me that San Carlos was yOUf 
wife's lover?" "Indeed, sire, it did not occur to me that this information had 
any bearing on Your Majesty's glory or my own," said Talleyrand calmly, 
completely unflustered. Mter a few more insults, Napoleon walked away. 
Talleyrand slowly crossed the room, moving with his characteristic limp. 
As an attendant helped hirn with his doak, he tumed to his fellow ministers 
(all afraid they would never see hirn again), and said, "What a pity, gentle­
men, that so great a man should have such bad manners." 
Despite his anger, Napoleori)iid not arrest his foreign minister. He 
merely relieved hirn of his duties ,d banished hirn from the court, believ­
ing that for this man humiliation would be punishment enough, He did not 
realize that word had quickly spread of his tirade-of how the emperor had 
completely lost control of hirnself, and how Talleyrand had essentially hu­
miliated hirn by maintaining his composure and dignity. A page had been 
tumed: For the first time people had seen the great emperor lose his cool 
under fire. A feeling spread that he was on the way down. As Talleyrand 
later said, "This is the beginning ofthe end." 
Interpretation 
This was indeed the beginning of the end. Waterloo was still six years 
ahead, but Napoleon was on a slow descent to defeat, crystallizing in 1812 
with his disastrous invasion of Russia. Talleyrand was the first to see the 
signs of his decline, especially in the irrational war with Spain. Sometime in 
1808, the minister decided that for the future peace of Europe, Napoleon 
had to go. And so he conspired with Fouche. 
It is possible that the conspiracy was never anything more than a 
ploy-a device to push Napoleon over the edge. For it is hard to believe 
that two of the most practical men in history would only go halfway in their 
plotting. They may have been only stirring the waters, trying to goad 
Napoleon into a misstep. And indeed, what they got was the tantrum that 
laid out his loss of control for all to see. In fact, Napoleon's soon-famous 
blowup that afternoon had a profoundly negative effect on his public 
image. 
This is the problem with the angry response. At first it may strike fear 
and terror, but only in some, and as the days pass and the storm clears, 
other responses emerge-e mbarrassment and uneasiness about the 
shouter's capacity for going out of control, and resentrnent of what has 
been said. Losing your temper, you always make unfair and exaggerated 
accusations. A few such tirades and people are counting the days until you 
are gone. 
In the face of a conspiracy against hirn, a conspiracy between his two 
most important ministers, Napoleon certainly had a right to feel angry and 
anxious. Eut by responding so angrily, and so publicly, he only demon­
strated his frustration. To show your frustration is to show that you have 
lost your power to shape events; it is the helpless action of the child who re­
sorts to a hysterical fit to get his way. The powerful never reveal this kind of 
weakness. 
There were a number of things Napoleon could have done in this situ­
ation. He could have thought about the fact that two eminently sensible 
men had had reason to turn against hirn, and could have listened and 
learned from them. He could have tried to win them back to hirn. He could 
even have gotten rid of them, making their imprisonment or death an omi­
nous display of his power. No tirades, no childish fits, no embarrassing 
after-effects- just a quiet and definitive severing of ties. 
Remember: Tantrums neither intimidate nor inspire loyalty. They 
only create doubts and uneasiness about your power. Exposing your weak­
ness, these stormy eruptions often herald a fall.

328 LAW 39 in his way: the empress and her husband, Ras Gugsa. Selassie knew the 
royal couple hated hirn and wanted to get rid of hirn, so to cut short their 
plotting he made Gugsa the governor of the northern province of 
Begemeder, forcing hirn to leave the capital, where the empress lived. 
For several years Gugsa played the loyal administrator_ But Selassie 
did not trust hirn: He knew that Gugsa and the empress were plotting re­
venge_ As time passed and Gugsa made no move, the chances of a plot 
only increased. Selassie knew what he had to do: draw Gugsa out, get 
under his skin, and push hirn into action before he was ready. 
For several years, a northern tribe, the Azebu Gallas, had been in vir­
tual rebellion against the throne, robbing and pillaging local villages and 
refusing to pay taxes. Selassie had done nothing to stop them, letting them 
grow stronger. Finally, in 1929, he ordered Ras Gugsa to lead an army 
against these disobedient tribesmen. Gugsa agreed, but inwardly he 
seethed-he had no grudge aga inst the Azebu Gallas, and the demand that 
he fight them hurt his pride. He could not disobey the order, but as he 
worked to put together an army, he began to spread an ugly rumor-that 
Selas sie was in cahoots with the pope, and planned to convert the country 
to Roman Catholicism and make it a colony of Italy_ Gugsa's army swelled, 
and some of the tribes from which its soldiers came secretly agreed to fight 
Selas sie. In March of 1930 an enormous force of 35,000 men began to 
march, not on the Azebu Gallas but south, toward the capital of Addis 
Ababa. Made confident by his growing strength, Gugsa now openly led a 
holy war to depose Selas sie and put the country back in the hands of true 
Christian s. 
He did not see the trap that had been laid for hirn. Before Selassie had 
ordered Gugsa to fight the Azebu Gallas, he had secured the support of the 
Ethiopian church. And before the revolt got underway, he had bribed sev­
eral of Gugsa's key allies not to show up for battle. As the rebel army 
marched south, airplanes flew overhead dropping leaflets announcing that 
the highest church officials had recognized Selassie as the true Christian 
leader of Ethiopia, and that they had excommunicated Gugsa for foment­
ing a civil war. These leaflets severely blunted the emotions behind the 
holy crusade. And as battle loomed and the support that Gugsa's allies had 
promised hirn failed to show up, soldiers began to flee or defect. 
When the battle came, the rebel army quicky collapsed. Refusing to 
surrender, Ras Gugsa was killed in the fighting. The empress, distraught 
over her husband's death, died a few days later. On April 30, Selassie is­
sued a formal proclarnation announcing his new title: Emperor of Ethiopia. 
Interpretation 
Haile Selassie always saw several moves ahead. He knew that if he let Ras 
Gugsa decide the time and place of the revolt, the danger would be much 
greater than ifhe forced Gugsa to act on Selassie's terms. So he goaded hirn 
into rebellion by offending his manly pride, asking hirn to fight people he 
had no quarrel with on behalf of a man he hated. Thinking everything out 
ahead, Selassie made sure that Gugsa's rebellion would come to nothing, 
and that he could use it to do away with his last two enemies. 
This is the essence of the Law: When the waters are still, your oppo­
nents have the time and space to plot actions that they will initiate and con­
trol. So stir the waters, force the fish to the surface, get them to act before 
theyare ready, steal the initiative. The best way to do this is to play on un­
controllable emotions-pride, vanity, love, hate. Once the water is stirred 
up, the little fish cannot help but rise to the bait. The angrier they become, 
the less control they have, and finally they are caught in the whirlpool you 
have made, and they drown. 
A sovereign should never launch an army out 01 anger, 
aleader should never start a war out olwrath.

KEYS TO POWER 
Angry people usually end up looking ridiculous, for their response seems 
out of proportion to what occasioned it. They have taken things too seri­
ously, exaggerating the hurt or insult that has been done to them. They are 
so sensitive to slight that it becomes comical how much they take person­
ally. More comical still is their belief that their outbursts signify power. The 
truth is the opposite: Petulance is not power, it is a sign of helplessness. 
People may temporarily be cowed by your tantrums, hut in the end they 
lose respect for you. They also realize they can easily undermine a person 
with so little self-control. 
The answer, however, is not to repress our angry or emotional re­
sponses. For repression drains us of energy and pushes us into strange be­
havior. Instead we have to change our perspective: We have to realize that 
nothing in the sodal realm, and in the game of power, is personal. 
Everyone is caught up in achain of events that long predates the pre­
sent moment. Our anger often sterns from problems in our childhood, 
from the problems of our parents which stern from their own childhood, on 
and on. Our anger also has roots in the many interactions with others, the 
accumulated disappointments and heartaches that we have suffered. An in­
dividual will often appear as the instigator of our anger but it is much more 
complicat ed, goes far beyond what that individual did to uso If a person ex­
plodes with anger at you (and it seems out of proportion to what you did to 
them), you must remind yourself that it is not exclusively directed at you­
do not be so vain. The cause is much larger, goes way back in time, in­
volves dozens of prior hurts, and is actually not worth the bother to 
understand. Instead of seeing it as a personal grudge , look at the emotional 
outburst as a disguised power move, an attempt to control or punish you 
cloaked in the form of hurt feelings and anger. 
This shift of perspective will let you play the game of power with more 
clarity and energy. Instead of overreacting, and becoming ensnared in peo-OITC!{ HI(;II PRIEST

During an important batde in the War of the Three Kingdoms, in the

An angry action would have called attention to the generals' disloyalty,

the conspiracy personally, the emperor should have played the game like 
Ts'ao Ts'ao, carefully weighing the consequences of any action he took.

leyrand, or to bring the minister gradually back to his side and punish him 
later. 
Anger only cuts off our options, and the powerful cannot thrive with­
out options. Once you train yourself not to take matters personally, and to 
control your emotional responses, you will have placed yourself in a posi­
tion of tremendous power: Now you can play with the emotional responses 
of other people. Stir the insecure into action by impugning their manhood, 
and by dangling the prospect of an easy victory before their faces. Do as 
Houdini did when challenged by the less successful escape artist Kleppini: 
Reveal an apparent weakness (Houdini let Kleppini steal the combination 
for a pair of cuffs) to lure your opponent into action. Then you can beat 
hirn with ease. With the arrogant too you can appear weaker than you are, 
taunting them into a rash action. 
Sun Pin, commander of the armies of Ch'i and loyal disciple of Sun­
tzu, once led his troops against the armies of Wei, which outnumbered hirn 
two to one. "Let us light a hundred thousand fires when our army enters 
Wei," suggested Sun Pin, "fifty thousand on the next day, and only thirty 
thousand on the third." On the third day the Wei general exclaimed, "I 
knew the men of Ch'i were cowards, and after only three days more than 
half of them have deserted!" So, leaving behind his slow-moving heavy in­
fantry, the general decided to seize the moment and move swiftly on the 
Ch'i camp with a lighdy armed force. Sun Pin's troops retreated, luring 
Wei's army into a narrow pass, where they ambushed and destroyed them. 
With the Wei general dead and his forces decimated, Sun Pin now easily 
defeated the rest of his army. 
In the face of a hot-headed enemy, finally, an excellent response is no 
response. Follow the Talleyrand tactic: Nothing is as infuriating as a man 
who keeps his cool while others are losing theirs. If it will work to your ad­
vantage to unsettle people, affect the aristocratic, bored pose, neither 
mocking nor triumphant but simply indifferent. This will light their fuse. 
When they embarrass themselves with atemper tantrum, you will have 
gained several victories, one of these being that in the face of their childish­
ness you have maintain ed your dignity and composure. 
Image: The Pond of Fish. The waters 
are clear and calm, and the fish are weIl below the surface. 
Stir the waters and they emerge. Stir it so me more and they get 
angry, rising to the surface, biting whatever comes near­
including a freshly baited hook. 
Authority: If your opponent is of a hot temper, try to irritate hirn. If he 
is arrogant, try to encourage his egotism. . . . One who is skilled at 
making the enemy move does so by creating a situation according to 
which the enemy will act; he entices the enemy with something he is 
certain to take. He keeps the enemy on the move by holding out bait 
and then attacks hirn with picked troops. (Sun-tzu, fourth century B.C.) 
REVERSAL 
When playing with people's emotions you have to be careful. Study the 
enemy beforehan d: Some fish are best left at the bottom of the pond. 
The leaders of the city of Tyre, capital of ancient Phoenicia, feIt confi­
dent they could withstand Alexander the Great, who had conquered the 
Orient but had not attacked their city, which stood weIl protected on the 
water. They sent ambassadors to Alexander saying that although they 
would recognize hirn as emperor they would not allow hirn or his forces to 
enter Tyre. This of course enraged hirn, and he immediately mounted a 
siege. For four months the city withstood hirn, and finally he decided that 
the struggle was not worth it, and that he would come to tenns with the 
Tyrians. But they, feeling that they had already baited Alexander and got­
ten away with it, and confident that they could withstand hirn, refused to 
LAW 39 331 
332 LAW 39 negotiate-- in fact they killed his messengers. 
This pushed Alexan der over the edge. Now it did not matter to him 
how long the siege lasted or how large an army it needed; he had the re­
sources, and would do whatever it took. He remounted his assault so stren­
uously that he captured Tyre within days, burned it to the ground, and sold 
its people into slavery. 
You can bait the powerful and get them to commit and divide their 
forces as Sun Pin did, but test the waters first. Find the gap in their strength. 
If there is no gap-if they are impossibly strong-you have nothing to gain 
and everything to lose by provoking them. Choose carefully whom you 
bait, and never stir up the sharks. 
Finally there are times when a well-timed burst of anger can do you 
good, but your anger must be manufac tured and under your control. Then 
you can determine exactly how and on whom it will fall. Never stir up re­
actions that will work against you in the long fUll. And use your thunder­
bolts rarely, to make them the more intimida ting and meaningful. Whether 
purposefully staged or not, if your outbursts come too often, they will lose 
their power.

334 LAW 40 MONE Y AND POWER 
In the re alm of power, everything must be judged by its cost, and every­
thing has a price. What is offered for free or at bargain rates often comes 
with a psycholo gical price tag-complicated feelings of obligati on, com­
promises with quality, the insecurity those compromises bring, on and on. 
The powerful learn early to protect their most valuable resources: indepen­
dence and room to maneuver. By paying the full price, they keep them­
selves free of dangerous entangle ments and worries. 
Being open and flexible with money also teaches the value of strategie 
generosity, a variation on the old trick of "giving when you are about to 
take." By giving the appropriate gift, you put the recipient under obliga­
tion. Generosity softens people up--to be deceived. By gaining a reputa­
tion for liberality, you win people's admiration while distracting them from 
your power plays. By strategically spreading your wealth, you charm the 
other courtiers, creating pleasure and making valuable allies. 
Look at the masters of power-the Caesars, the Queen Elizabeths, the 
Michelang elos, the Medicis: Not a miser among them. Even the great con 
artists spend freely to swindle . Tight purse strings are unattractiv e--when 
engaged in seduction, Casanova would give completely not only of himself 
but of his wallet. The powerful understand that money is psycho logically 
charged, and that it is also avessei of politeness and sociability. They make 
the human side of money a weapon in their armory. 
For everyone able to play with money, thousands more are locked in a 
self-destructive refusal to use money creatively and strategically. These 
types represent the opposite pole to the powerful, and you must leam to 
recognize them-either to avoid their poisonous natures or to turn their in­
flexibility to your advantage : 
The Greedy Fish. The greedy fish take the human side out of money. 
Cold and ruthless, they see only the lifeless balance sheet; viewing others 
solely as either pawns or obstructions in their pursuit of wealth, they tram­
ple on people's sentiments and alienate valuable allies. No one wants to 
work with the greedy fish, and over the years they end up isolated, which 
often proves their undoing. 
Greedy fish are the con artist's bread and butter: Lured by the bait of 
easy money, they swallow the ruse hook, line, and sinker. They are easy to 
deceive, for they spend so much time dealing with numbers (not with peo­
pIe) that they become blind to psychology, including their own. Either 
avoid them before they exploit you or play on their greed to your gain. 
The Bargain Demon. Powerful people judge everything by what it costs, 
not just in money but in time, dignity, and peace of mind. And this is ex­
actly what Bargain Demons cannot do. Wasting valuable time digging for 
bargains, they worry endlessly about what they could have gotten else­
where for a little less. On top of that, the bargain item they do buy is often 
shabby; perhaps it needs costly repairs, or will have to be replaced twice as 
fast as a high-quality item. The costs of these pursuits-not always in 
money (though the price of a bargain is often deceptive) but in time and 
peace of mind-discourage normal people from undertaking them, but for 
the Bargain Demon the bargain is an end in itself. 
These types might seem to harm only themselves, but their attitudes 
are contagious: Unless you resist them they will infect you with the inse­
eure feeling that you should have looked harder to find a cheaper price. 
Don't argue with them or try to change them. Just mentally add up the 
eost, in time and inner peace if not in hidden financial expense, of the irra­
tional pursuit of a bargain. 
The Sadist. Financial sadists play vicious power games with money as a 
way of asserting their power. They might, for examp le, make you wait for 
money that is owed you, promising you that the check is in the mail. Or if 
they hire you to work for them, they meddle in every aspect of the job, 
haggling and giving you ulcers. Sadists seem to think that paying for some­
thing gives them the right to torture and abuse the seIler. They have no 
sense of the courtier element in money. If you are unlucky enough to get 
involved with this type, accepting a financial loss may be better in the long 
run than getting entangled in their destructive power games. 
The Indiscriminate Giver. Generosity has adefinite function in power: 
It attracts people, softens them up, makes allies out of them. But it has to be 
used strategi cally, with a definite end in mind. Indiscriminate Givers, on 
the other hand, are generous because they want to be loved and admired 
by all. And their generosity is so indiscriminate and needy that it may not 
have the desired effect: If they give to one and all, why should the recipient 
feel special? Attractive as it may seem to make an Indis criminate Giver 
your mark, in any involvement with this type you will often feel burdened 
by their insatiable emotional needs.

Mter Francisco Pizarro conquered Peru, in 1532, gold from the Incan Em­

an Indian chief to the east of Peru who once each year would ritually cover 
himself in gold dust and dive into a lake. Soon word of mouth transformed 
EI Dorado, the "Golden Man," into an empire called EI Dorado, wealthier 
than the Incan, where the streets were paved and the buildings inlaid with 
gold. This elaboration of the story did not seem implausible, for surely a

336 LAW 40 In February of 1541, the largest expedition yet in this venture, led by 
Pizarro's brother Gonzalo, left Quito, in Ecuador. Resplendent in their ar­
mors and colorful silks, 340 Spaniards headed east, along with 4,000 Indi­
ans to carry supplies and serve as scouts, 4,000 swine, dozens of llamas, 
and elose to 1,000 dogs. Eut the expedition was so on hit by torrential rain, 
which rotted its gear and spoiled its food. Meanwhile, as Gonzalo Pizarro 
questioned the Indians they met along the way, those who seemed to be 
withholding inf ormation, or who had not even heard of the fabulous king­
dom, he would torture and feed to the dogs. Word of the Spaniards' mur­
derousness spread quickly among the Indians, who realized that the only 
way to avoid Gonzalo's wrath was to make up stories about EI Dorado 
and send hirn as far away as possible. As Gonzalo and his men followed 
the leads the Indians gave them, then, they were only led farther into deep 
jungle. 
The explorers' spirits sagged. Their uniforms had long since shredded; 
their armor rusted and they threw it away; their shoes were tom to pieces, 
forcing them to walk barefoot; the Indian slaves they had set out with had 
either died or deserted them; they had eaten not only the swine but the 
hunting dogs and llamas. They lived on roots and fruit. Realizing that they 
could not continue this way, Pizarro decided to risk river travel, and a 
barge was built out of rotting wood. Eut the journey down the treacherous 
Napo River proved no easier. Setting up camp on the river's edge, Gonzalo 
sent scouts ahead on the barge to find Indian settlements with food. He 
waited and waited for the scouts to return, only to find out they had de­
cided to desert the expedition and continue down the river on their own. 
The rain continued without end. Gonzalo's men forgot about EI Do­
rado; they wanted only to return to Quito. Finally, in August of 1542, a lit­
tle over a hundred men, from an expedition originally numbering in the 
thousands, managed to find their way back. To the residents of Quito they 
seemed to have emerged from hell itself, wrapped in tatters and skins, their 
bodies covered in sores, and so emaciated as to be unrecognizab le. For 
over a year and a half they had marched in an enormous cirele, two thou­
sand miles by foot. The vast sums of money invested in the expedition had 
yielded nothing-no sign of EI Dorado and no sign of gold. 
Interpretation 
Even after Gonzalo Pizarro's disaster, the Spaniards launched expedition 
after expedition in search of EI Dorado. And like Pizarro the conquistadors 
would bum and loot villages, torture Indians, endure unimaginable hard­
ships, and get no eloser to gold. The money they spent on such expeditions 
cannot be calculated; yet despite the futility of the search, the lure of the 
fantasyendured. 
Not only did the search for EI Dorado cost millions of lives-both In­
dian and Spanish-it helped bring the ruin of the Spanish empire. Gold be­
came Spain's obsession. The gold that did find its way back to Spain-and 
a lot did-was reinvested in more expeditions, or in the purehase of luxu­
ries, rather than in agriculture or any other productive endeavor. Whole 
Spanish towns were depopulated as their menfolk left to hunt gold. Farms 
fell into ruin, and the army had no recruits for its European wars. By the 
end of the seventeenth century, the entire country had shrunk by more 
than half of its population; the city of Madrid had gone from a population 
of 400,000 to 150,000. With diminishing returns from its efforts over so 
many years, Spain fell into a decline from which it never recovered. 
Power requires self-discipli ne. The prospect of wealth, particularly 
easy, sudden wealth, plays havoc with the emotions. The suddenly rich be­
lieve that more is always possible. The free lunch, the money that will fall 
into your lap, is just around the corner. 
In this delusion the greedy neglect everything power really depends 
on: self-control, the goodwill of others, and so on. Understa nd: With one 
exception-death-no lasting change in fortune comes quickly. Sudden 
wealth rarely lasts, for it is built on nothing solid. Never let lust for money 
lure you out of the protective and enduring fortress of real power. Make 
power your goal and money will find its way to you. Leave EI Dorado for 
suckers and fools. 
Transgression 11 
In the early eighteenth century, no one stood higher in English society 
than the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough . The duke, having led suc­
cessful campaigns against the French, was considered Europe's premier 
general and strategist. And his wife, the duchess, after much maneuvering, 
had established herself as the favorite of Queen Anne, who became ruler 
of England in 1702. In 1704 the duke's triumph at the Battle of Blenheim 
made hirn the toast of England, and to honor hirn the queen awarded hirn 
a large plot of land in the town of Woodstock, and the funds to create a 
great palace there. Calling his planned horne the Palace of Blenheim, the 
duke chose as his architect the young John Vanbrugh, a kind of Renais­
sance man who wrote plays as weIl as designed buildings . And so con­
struction began, in the summer of 1705, with much fanfare and great 
hopes. 
Vanbrugh had a dramatist's sense of architecture. His palace was to be 
a monument to Marlborough's brilliance and power, and was to include 
artificial lakes, enormous bridges, elaborate gardens, and other fantastical 
touches. From day one, however, the duchess could not be pleased: She 
thought Vanbrugh was wasting money on yet another stand of trees; she 
wanted the palace finished as so on as possible. The duchess tortured Van­
brugh and his workmen on every detail. She was consumed with petty 
maUers; although the government was paying for Blenheim, she counted 
every penny. Eventually her grumbling, about Blenheim and other things 
too, created an irreparable rift between her and Queen Anne, who, in 1711, 
dismissed her from the court, ordering her to vacate her apartments at the 
royal palace. When the duchess left (fuming over the loss of her position, 
and also of her royal salary), she emptied the apartment of every fixture 
down to the brass doorknobs. 
Over the next ten years, work on Blenheim would stop and start, as 
the funds became harder to procure from the government. The duchess suspicion of robbing 
the disciple of his soul.

338 LAW 40 thought Vanbrugh was out to ruin her. She quibbled over every carload of 
stone and bushel of lime, counted every extra yard of iron railing or foot of 
wainscot, hurling abuse at the wasteful workmen, contractors, and survey­
ors. Marlborough, old and weary, wanted nothing more than to settle into 
the palace in his last years, but the project became bogged down in a 
swamp of litigation, the workmen suing the duchess for wages, the duchess 
suing the architect right back. In the midst of this interminable wrangling, 
the duke died. He had never spent a night in his beloved Blenheim. 
After Marlboroug h's death, it becarne clear that he had a vast estate, 
worth over .E2 million-more than enough to pay for finishing the palace. 
But the duchess would not relent: She held back Vanbrugh's wages as weIl 
as the workmen 's, and finally had the architect dismissed. The man who 
took his place finished Blenheim in a few years, following Vanbrugh's de­
signs to the letter. Vanbrugh died in 1726, locked out of the palace by the 
duchess, unable to set foot in his greatest creation. Foreshadowing the ro­
mantic movement, Blenheim had started a whole new trend in architec­
ture, but had given its creator a twenty-year nightmare. 
Interpretation 
For the Duchess of Marlborough, money was a way to play sadistic power 
games. She saw the loss of money as a symbolic loss of power. With Van­
brugh her contortions went deeper still: He was a great artist, and she en­
vied his power to create, to attain a farne outside her reach. She may not 
have had his gifts, but she did have the money to torture and abuse hirn 
over the pettiest details-to ruin his life. 
This kind of sadism, however, be ars an awful price. It made construc­
tion that should have lasted ten years take twenty. It poisoned many a rela­
tionship, alienated the duchess from the court, deeply pained the duke 
(who wanted only to live peacefully in Blenheim) , created endless lawsuits, 
and took years offVanbrugh's life. Finally, too, posterity had the last word: 
Vanbrugh is recognized as a genius while the duchess is forever remem­
bered for her consummate cheapne ss. 
The powerful must have grandeur of spirit-they can never reveal any 
pettiness. And money is the most visible arena in which to display either 
grandeur or pettiness. Best spend freely, then, and create areputation for 
generosity, which in the end will pay great dividends. Never let financial 
details blind you to the bigger picture of how people perceive you. Their 
resentment will cost you in the long run. And if you want to meddle in the 
work of creative people under your hire, at least pay them weIl. Your 
money will buy their submission better than your displays of power. 
OBSER VANCES OF THE LAW 
Observance I 
Pietro Aretino, son of a lowly shoemaker, had catapulted hirnself into farne 
as a writer of biting satires. But like every Renaissance artist, he needed to 
find a patron who would give hirn a comf ortable lifestyle while not inter-
fering with his work. In 1528 Aretino decided to attempt a new strategy in 
the patronage game. Leaving Rome, he established hirnself in Venice, 
where few had heard of hirn. He had a fair amount of money he had man­
aged to save, but little else. Soon after he moved into his new horne, how­
ever, he threw open its doors to rich and poor, regaling them with 
banquets and amusements. He befriended each and every gondolier, tip­
ping them royally. In the streets, he spread his money liberally, giving it 
away to beggars, orphans, washerwom en. Among the city's commoners, 
word quickly spread that Aretino was more than just a great writer, he was 
a man of power-a kind of lord. 
Artists and men of influence so on began to frequent Aretino's house. 
Within a few years he made hirnself a celebrity; no visiting dignitary would 
think of leaving Venice without paying hirn a call. His generosity had cost 
hirn most of his savings, but had bought hirn influence and a good name­
a cornerstone in the foundation of power. Since in Renaissance Italy as 
elsewhere the ability to spend freely was the privilege of the rich, the aris­
tocracy thought Aretino had to be a man of influ ence, since he spent 
money like one. And since the influence of a man of influence is worth 
buying, Aretino became the recipient of all sorts of gifts and moneys. 
Dukes and duchesses, wealthy merchants, and popes and princes com­
peted to gain his favor, and showered hirn with all kinds of presents. 
Aretino's spending habits, of course, were strategie, and the strategy 
worked like acharm. But for real money and comfort he needed a great 
patron's bottomless pockets. Having surveyed the possibilities, he eventu­
ally set his sights on the extremely wealthy Marquis of Mantua, and wrote 
an epic poem that he dedicated to the marquis. This was a common prac­
tice of writers looking for patronage: In exchange for a dedication they 
would get a small stipend, enough to write yet another poem, so that they 
spent their lives in a kind of constant servility. Aretino, however, wanted 
power, not a measly wage. He might dedicate a poem to the marquis, but 
he would offer it to hirn as a gift, implying by doing so that he was not a 
hired hack looking for a stipend but that he and the marquis were equals. 
Aretino's gift-giving did not stop there: As a elose friend of two of 
Venice's greatest artists, the sculptor Jacopo Sansovino and the painter 
Titian, he convinced these men to participate in his gift-giving scheme. 
Aretino had studied the marquis before going to work on hirn, and knew 
his taste inside and out; he was able to advise Sansovino and Titian what 
subject matter would please the marquis most. When he then sent a Sanso­
vino sculpture and a Titian painting to the marquis as gifts from all three of 
them, the man was beside hirnself with joy. 
Over the next few months, Aretino sent other gifts-swords, saddles, 
the glass that was a Venetian specialty, things he knew the marquis prized. 
Soon he, Titian, and Sansovino began to receive gifts from the marquis in 
return. And the strategy went further: When the son-in-Iaw of a friend of 
Aretino's found hirnself in jail in Mantua, Aretino was able to get the mar­
quis to arrange his release. Aretino's friend, a wealthy merchant, was a 
man of great influence in Venice; by turning the goodwill he had built up years passed hy after 
this promise, and 
Pharaoh, doomed to 
ruin, continued to live 
in all his magnificence. 
Moses was impatient 
for God to destroy 
Pharaoh quickly, and 
he could not endure to 
wait any langer. So he 
fasted for forty days 
and went to Mount 
Sinai, and in his 
communing with god 
he said, "0 Lord, Thou 
didst promise that 
Thou wouldst destroy 
Pharaoh, and still he 
has forsaken none of 
his blasphemies and 
pretensions. So when 
wilt Thou destroy 
hirn?" 
A voice came from The 
Truth saying, "0 
Moses, you want Me to 
destroy Pharaoh as 
quickly as possihle, but 
a thousand times a 
thousand of My 
servants want Me never 
to do so, because they 
partake of his bounty 
and enjoy tranquillity 
under his rule. Sy My 
power I swear that as 
lang as he provides 
abundant food and 
comfort for My erea-
tu res, I shall not 
destroy hirn." 
Moses said, "Then 
when will Thy promise 
be fulfilled?" God said, 
"My promise will be 
fulfilled when he with­
holds his provision 
from My creatures. If 
ever he begins to lessen 
his bounty, know that 
his hour is drawing 
near. 
It chanced that one day 
Pharaoh said to 
Haman, "Moses has 
gathered the Sons of 
Israel about hirn and is 
causing us disquiet. We

and keep the saving in 
reserve." He deducted 
2,000 sheep, 200 co ws, 
and a 100 camels, and 
similarly every two or 
three days reduced the 
ration. Moses then 
knew that the promise 
ofThe Truth was near 
to fulfillment, for exces­
sive economy is a sign 
of decline and a bad 
omen. The masters of 
tradition say that on 
the day when Pharaoh 
was drowned only two 
ewes had been killed in 
his küchen. 
Nothing is better than 
generosity .... 1f a man 
is rich and desires, 
without a royal charter, 
to act like a lord; if he 
wants men to humble 
themselves before him, 
to revere him and call 
him lord and prin ce, 
then tell him every day 
to spread a table with 
victuals. All those who 
have acquired renown 
in the world, have 
gained it mainly 
through hospital ity,

340 LAW 40 with the marquis to use, Aretino had now bought this man's indebted ness, 
too, and he in turn would help Aretino when he could. The circle of influ­
ence was growing wider. Time and again, Aretino was able to cash in on 
the immense political power of the marqui s, who also helped him in his 
many court romances. 
Eventually, however, the relationship became strained, as Aretino 
came to feel that the marquis should have requited his generosity better. 
But he would not lower hirnself to begging or whining: Since the exchange 
of gifts between the two men had made them equals, it would not seem 
right to bring up money. He simply withdrew from the marqui s's circle and 
hunted for other wealthy prey, settling first on the French king Francis, 
then the Medicis, the Duke of Urbino, Emperor Charles V, and more. In 
the end, having many patrons meant he did not have to bow to any of 
them, and his power seemed comparable to that of a great lord. 
Interpr etation 
Aretino understood two fundamental properties of money: First, that it has 
to circulate to bring power. What money should buy is not lifeless objects 
but power over people. By keeping money in constant circula tion, Aretino 
bought an ever-expanding circle of influence that in the end more than 
compensated hirn for his expenses. 
Second, Aretino understood the key property of the gift. To give a gift 
is to imply that you and the recipient are equals at the very least, or that 
you are the recipient's superior. A gift also involves an indebted ness or 
obligat ion; when friends, for instance, offer you something for free, you 
can be sure they expect something in return, and that to get it they are 
making you feel indebted. (The mechanism may or may not be entirely 
conscious on their part, but this is how it works.) 
Aretino avoided such encumbrances on his freedom. Instead of acting 
like a menial who expects the powerful to pay his way in life, he turned the 
whole dynamic around; instead of being indebted to the powerful, he 
made the powerful indebted to hirn. This was the point of his gift-giving, a 
ladder that carried hirn to the hig hest sociallevels. By the end of his life he 
had become the most famous writer in Europe. 
Understa nd: Money may determine power relationship s, but those re­
lationships need not depend on the amount of money you have; they also 
depend on the way you use it. Powerful people give freely, buying influ­
ence rather than things. If you accept the inferior position because you 
have no fortune yet, you may find yourself in it forever. Play the trick that 
Aretino played on Italy's aristocracy: Imagine yourself an equal. Play the 
lord, give freely, open your doors, circulate your money, and create the fa­
cade ofpower through an alchemy that transforms money into influence. 
Observance II 
Soon after Baron James Rothschild made his fortune in Paris in the early 
1820s, he faced his most intractable problem: How could aJew and a Ger­
man, a total outsider to French society, win the respect of the xenophobie 
French upper classes? Rothschild was a man who understood power-he 
knew that his fortune would bring hirn status, but that if he remained so­
cially alienated neither his status nor his fortune would last. So he looked at 
the society of the time and asked what would win their hearts. 
Charity? The French couldn't care less. Political influence? He already 
had that, and if anything it only made people more suspicious of hirn. The 
one weak spot, he decided, was boredom. In the period of the restoration 
of the monarchy, the French upper classes were bored. So Rothschild 
began to spend astounding sums of money on entertaining them. He hired 
the best architects in France to design his gardens and ballroom; he hired 
Marie-Antoine Careme, the most celebrated French chef, to prepare the 
most lavish parties Paris had ever witnessed; no Frenchman could resist, 
even if the parties were given by a German Jew. Rothschild's weekly 
soirees began to attract bigger and bigger numbers. Over the next few 
years he won the only thing that would seeure an outsider's power: social 
acceptance. 
Interpretation 
Strategie generosity is always a great weapon in building a support base, 
particularly for the outsider. But the Baron de Rothschild was cleverer still: 
He knew it was his money that had created the barrier between hirn and 
the French, making hirn look ugly and untrustworthy. The best way to 
overcome this was literally to waste huge sums, a gesture to show he valued 
French culture and society over money. What Rothschild did resembled 
the famous potlatch feasts of the American Northwest: By periodically de­
stroying its wealth in a giant orgy of festivals and bonfires, an Indian tribe 
would symbolize its power over other tribes. The base of its power was not 
money but its ability to spend, and its confidence in a superiority that 
would restore to it all that the potlatch had destroyed. 
In the end, the baron's soirees reflected his desire to mingle not just in 
France's business world but in its society. By wasting money on his pot­
Iatches, he hoped to demonstrate that his power went beyond money into 
the more precious realm of culture. Rothschild may have won social accep­
tance by spending money, but the support base he gained was one that 
money alone could not buy. To secure his fortune he had to "waste" it. That 
is strategie generosity in a nutshell-the ability to be flexible with your 
wealth, putting it to work, not to buy objects, but to win people's hearts. 
Observance III 
The Medicis of Renaissance Florence had built their immense power on 
the fortune they had made in banking. But in Florence, centuries-old re­
public that it was, the idea that money bought power went against all the 
city's proud democratic values. Cosimo de' Medici, the first of the family to 
gain great fame, worked around this by keeping a low profi le. He never 
flaunted his wealth. But by the time his grandson Lorenzo came of age, in 
the 1470s, the family's wealth was too large, and their influence too notice­
able, to be disguised any longer. 
Lorenzo solved the problem in his own way by developing the strat­
egy of distraction that has served people of wealth ever since: He became THE FLA ME-COLOREIl

During the campaign 
of Cambyses in Egypt, 
a great many Creeks 
visited that country for 
one reason or another: 
same, as was to be 
expected, for trade, 
same to serve in the 
army, oth ers, no doubt, 
out of mere curiosity, to 
see what they could see. 
Amongst the sightseers 
was Aeaces's san Sylo­
san, the exiled brother 
of Polycrates of Samos. 
While he was in Egypt, 
Syloson had an extra­
ordinary strake of luck: 
he was hanging about 
the streets of Memphis 
dressed in a flame­
colored cloak, when 
Darius, who at that 
time was a member of 
Cambyses' s guard and 
not yet of any particu­
lar importance, 
happened to catch 
sight of him and, seized 
with a sudden longing 
to possess the cloak, 
came up to Syloson 
and made him an offer 
for it. 
His extreme anxiety to 
get it was obvious 
enough to Syloson, 
who was inspired to 
say: "1 am not selling 
this for any money, but 
if you must have it, 1 
will give it to you for 
free." Darius thereupon 
thanked him warmly 
and took it. Syloson at 
the moment merely 
thought he had lost it 
by his foolish good 
nature; then came the 
death of Cambyses and 
the revolt of the seven 
against the Magus, and 
Darius ascended the 
throne. Syloson now 
LAW 40 341 
had the news that the 
man whose request for 
the jiame-colored cloak 
he had formerly grati-
fied in Egypt had 
become king of Persia. 
He hurried to Susa, sat 
down at the entrance of 
the royal palace, and 
claimed to be included 
in the officiallist of the 
king's benefactors. The 
sentry on guard 
reported his claim to 
Darius, who asked in 
surprise who the man 
might be. "For surely," 
he said, "as I have so 
recently come to the 
throne, there cannot be 
any Greek to whom I 
am indebted for a 
service. Hardly any of 
them have been here 
yet, and J certainly 
cannot remember 
owing anything to a 
Greek. But bring hirn 
in all the same, that J 
may know what he 
means by this claim. " 
The guard escorted 
Syloson into the royal 
presence, and when the 
interpreters asked hirn 
who he was and what 
he had done to justify 
the statement that he 
was the king\· benefac-
tor, he reminded 
Darills of the story of 
the cloak, and said that 
he was the man who 
had given it hirn. 
"Sir," exclaimed 
Darius, "you are the 
most generous of men; 
for while J was still a

342 LAW 40 the most illustrious patron of the arts that history has ever known. Not only 
did he spend lavishly on paintings, he ereated Italy's finest apprentiee 
sehools for young artists. It was in one of these schools that the young 
Miehelangelo first eaught the attention of Lorenzo, who invited the artist to 
eome and live in his house. He did the same with Leonardo da Vinei. Onee 
under his wing, Michelange lo and Leonardo requited his generosity by be­
eoming loyal artists in his stable. 
Whenever Lorenzo faeed an enemy, he would wield the weapon of 
patronage. When Pisa, F1orenee's traditional enemy, threatened to rebel 
against it in 1472, Lorenzo plaeated its people by pouring money into its 
university, whieh had onee been its pride and joy but had long ago lost its 
luster. The Pisans had no defense against this insidious maneuver, which si­
multaneously fed their love of culture and blunted their desire for battle. 
Interpretation 
Lorenzo undoubtedly loved the arts, but his patronage of artists had a prae­
tieal funetion as weH, of whieh he was keenly aware. In F10renee at the 
time, banking was perhaps the least admired way of making money, and 
was eertainly not arespected souree of power. The arts were at the other 
pole, the pole of quasi-religious transeendenee. By spending on the arts, 
Lorenzo diluted people's opinions of the ugly souree of his wealth, disguis­
ing hirnself in nobility. There is no better use of strategie generosity than 
that of distraeting attention from an unsavory reality and wrapping oneself 
in the mantle of art or religion. 
Observance IV 
Louis XIV had an eagle eye for the strategie power of money. When he 
eame to the throne, the powerful nobility had reeently proven a thorn in 
the monareh y's side, and seethed with rebeHiousness. So he impoverished 
these aristoerats by making them spend enormous sums on maintaining 
their position in the eourt. Making them dependent on royal largesse for 
their livelihood, he had them in his claws. 
Next Louis brought the nobles to their knees with strategie generosity. 
It would work like this: Whenever he notieed a stubborn eourtier whose in­
fluenee he needed to gain, or whose troublem aking he needed to squelch, 
he would use his vast wealth to soften the soil. First he would ignore his vie­
tim, making the man anxious. Then the man would suddenly find that his 
son had been given a weH-paid post, or that funds had been spent liberally 
in his horne region, or that he had been given a painting he had long cov­
eted. Presents would flow from Louis's hands. Finally, weeks or months 
later, Louis would ask for the favor he had needed all along. A man who 
had onee vowed to do anything to stop the king would find he had lost the 
desire to fight. A straightfo rward bribe would have made him rebeHious; 
this was far more insidious. Facing hardened earth in whieh nothing eould 
take root, Louis loosened the soil before he planted his seeds. 
Interpretation 
Louis understood that there is a deep-rooted emotional element in our atti­
tude to money, an element going baek to ehildhood. When we are ehil-
dren, all kinds of complicated feelings about oUf parents center around 
gifts; we see the giving of a gift as a sign of love and approval. And that 
emotional element never goes away. The recipients of gifts, financial or 
otherwise, are suddenly as vulnerable as children, especially when the gift 
comes from someone in authority. They cannot help opening up; their will 
is loosened, as Louis loosened the soil. 
To succeed best, the gift should come out of the blue. It should be re­
markable for the fact that a gift like it has never been given before, or for 
being preceded by a cold shoulder from the giver. The more often you give 
to particular people, the blunter this weapon becomes. If they don't take 
your gifts for granted, becoming monsters of ingratitude, they will resent 
what appears to be charity. The sudden, unexpected, one-time gift will not 
spoil YOUf children; it will keep them under YOUf thumb. 
Observance V 
The antique dealer Fushimiya, who lived in the city of Edo (former name 
for Tokyo) in the seventeenth century, once made a stop at a village tea­
house. After enjoying a cup of tea, he spent several minutes scrutinizing the 
cup, which he eventually paid for and took away with hirn. A local artisan, 
watehing this, waited until Fushimiya left the shop, then approached the old 
woman who owned the teahouse and asked her who this man was. She told 
hirn it was Japan's most famous connoisseur, antique dealer to the lord of 
Izumo. The artisan ran out of the shop, caught up with Fushimiya, and 
begged hirn to seIl hirn the cup, which must clearly be valuable if Fushimiya 
judged it so. Fushimiya laughed heartily: "It's just an ordinary cup of Bizen 
ware," he explained, "and it is not valuable at all. The reason I was looking 
at it was that the steam seemed to hang about it strangely and I wondered if 
there wasn't a leak somewhere ." (Devotees of the Tea Ceremony were in­
terested in any odd or accidental beauty in nature.) Since the artisan still 
seemed so excited about it, Fushirniya gave hirn the cup for free. 
The artisan took the cup around, trying to find an expert who would 
appraise it at a high price, but since all of them recognized it as an ordinary 
teacup he got nowhere. Soon he was neglecting his own business, thinking 
only of the cup and the fortune it could bring. Finally he went to Edo to 
talk to Fushimiya at his shop. There the dealer, realizing that he had inad­
vertently caused this man pain by making hirn believe the cup had great 
worth, paid hirn 100 ryo (gold pieces) for the cup as a kindness. The cup 
was indeed mediocre, but he wanted to rid the artisan of his obsession, 
while also allowing hirn to feel that his effort had not been wasted. The ar­
tisan thanked hirn and went on his way. 
Soon word spread of Fushimiya's pUfchase of the teacup. Every dealer 
in Japan clamored for hirn to seIl it, since a cup he had bought for 100 ryo 
must be worth much more. He tried to explain the circumsta nces in which 
he had bought the cup, but the dealers could not be dissuaded. Fushimiya 
finally relented and put the cup up for sale. 
During the auction, two buyers simultaneously bid 200 ryo for the 
teacup, and then began to fight over who had bid first. Their fighting never regret that yuu

native island, which 
now since Oroetes 
killed my brother Poly­
crates is in the hands 
of one of our servants. 
Let Samos be your gift 
to me-but let no man 
in the island be killed 
or enslaved. " 
Darius consented to 
Syloson 's request, and 
dispatched a force 
under the command 
of Otanes, one of the 
seven, with orders to do 
everything that Syloson 
had asked.

The story shows, first, an essential aspect of money: That it is humans who 
have created it and humans who instill it with meaning and valu e. Second, 
with objects as with money, what the courtier most values are the senti­
ments and emotions embedded in them-these are what make them worth 
having. The lesson is simple: The more your gifts and your acts of generos­
ity play with sentiment, the more powernd they are. The object or concept 
that plays with a charged emotion or hits a chord of sentiment has more 
power than the money you squander on an expensive yet lifeless present.

Akimoto Suzut omo, a wealthy adherent of the tea ceremony, once gave his 
page 100 ryo (gold pieces) and instructed him to purchase a tea bowl of­
fered by a partic ular dealer. When the page saw the bowl, he doubted it 
was worth that much, and after much bargaining got the price reduced to 
95 ryo. Days later, after Suzutomo had put the bowl to use, the page 
proudly told hirn what he had done. 
"What an ignoramus you are!" replied Suzut omo. "A tea bowl that 
anyone asks 100 pieces of gold for can only be a family heirloom, and a 
thing like that is only sold when the family is pressed for money. And in 
that case they will be hoping to find someone who will give even 150 
pie ces for it. So what sort of fellow is it who does not consider their feel­
ings ? Quite apart from that, a curio that you give 100 ryo for is someth ing 
worth having, but one that has only cost 95 gives a mean impression. So 
never let me see that tea bowl again !" And he had the bowl locked away, 
and never took it out. 
Interpretation 
When you insist on paying less, you may save your five ryo, but the insult 
you cause and the cheap impression you create will cost you in reputation, 
which is the thing the powerful prize above all. Leam to pay the full 
price-it will save you a lot in the end.

Sometime near the beginning of the seventeenth century in Japan, a group 
of generals whiled away the time before a big battle by staging an incense­
smelling competition. Each participant anted up a prize for the contest's 
winners-b ows, arrows, saddles, and other items a warrior would covet. 
The great Lord Date Masamune happened to pass by and was induced to 
participate. For a prize, he offered the gourd that hung from his belt. Every­
one laughed, for no one wanted to win this cheap item. A retainer of the 
host finally accepted the gourd. 
When the party broke up, however, and the generals were chatting 
outside the tent, Masamune brought over his magnificent horse and gave it 
to the retainer. "There," he said, "a horse has come out of the gourd." The 
stunned generals suddenly regretted their seorn at Masamune's gift. 
Interpretation 
Masamune understood the following: Money gives its possessor the ability 
to give pleasure to others. The more you can do this, the more you attract 
admiration. When you make a horse come out of a gourd, you give the ul­
timate demonstration of your power. 
Image: The River. To protect 
yourself or to save the resource, 
you dam it up. Soon, however, 
the waters become dank and 
pestilent. Only the foulest

stagnant waters; nothing trav­
eIs on them, all commerce 
stops. Destroy the dam. When 
water flows and circulates, it gen­
erates abundance, wealth, and 
power in ever larger circles. The 
River must flood periodically 
for good things to flourish. 
Authority : The great man who is a miser is a great fool, and a man in 
high places can have no vice so harmful as avarice. A miserly man can 
conquer neither lands nor lordships, for he does not have a plentiful 
supply of friends with whom he may work his will. Whoever wants to 
have friends must not love his possessions but must acquire friends by 
means of fair gifts; for in the same way that the lodestone subtly draws 
iran to itself, so the gold and silver that a man gives attract the hearts 
of men. (The Roma nce ofthe Rose, Guillaume de Lorris, c. 1200-1238) I took money only

The powerful never forget that what is offered for free is inevitably a trick. 
Friends who offer favors without asking for payment williater want some­
thing far dearer than the money you would have paid them. The bargain 
has hidden problems, both material and psychological. Leam to pay, then,

On the other hand, this Law offers great opportunities for swindling 
and deception if you apply it from the other side. Dangling the lure of a 
free lunch is the con artist's stock in trade. 
No man was better at this than the most successful con artist of our 
age, Joseph Weil, a.k.a. "The Yellow Kid." The Yellow Kid leamed early 
that what made his swindles possible was his fellow humans' greed. "This 
desire to get something for nOthing," he once wrote, "has been very costly 
to many people who have dealt with me and with other con men. . . . 
When people leam-as I doubt they will-that they can't get something 
for nOthing, crime will diminish and we shall all live in greater harmony." 
Over the years Weil devised many ways to seduce people with the prospect 
of easy money. He would hand out "free" real estate-wh o could resist 
such an offer?-and then the suckers would leam they had to pay $25 to 
register the sale. Since the land was free, it seemed worth the high fee, and 
the Yellow Kid would make thousands of dollars on the phony registration. 
In exchange he would give his suckers a phony deed. Other times, he 
would tell suckers about a fixed horse race, or a stock that would eam 200 
percent in a few weeks. As he spun his stories he would watch the sucker's 
eyes open wide at the thought of a free lunch. 
The lesson is simple: Bait your deceptions with the possibility of easy 
money. People are essentially lazy, and want wealth to fall in their lap 
rather than to work for it. For a small sum, seIl them advice on how to 
make millions (P. T. Bamum did this later in life), and that small sum will 
become a fortune when multiplied by thousands of suckers. Lure people in 
with the prospect of easy money and you have the room to work still more 
deceptions on them, since greed is powerful enough to blind your victims 
to anything. And as the Yellow Kid said, half the fun is teaching a moral 
lesson: Greed does not pay.

348 LAW 41 TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW 
When Louis XIV died, in 1715, after a glorious fifty-five-year reign, all eyes 
focused on his great-grandson and chosen successor, the future Louis Xv. 
Would the boy, only five at the time, prove as great aleader as the Sun 
King? Louis XIV had transformed a country on the verge of civil war into 
the preeminent power in Europe. The last years of his reign had been diffi­
cuIt-he had been old and tired-but it was hoped that the child would de­
velop into the kind of strong mler who would reinvigorate the land and 
add to the firm foundation that Louis XIV had laid. 
To this end the child was given the best minds of France as his tutors, 
men who would instruct hirn in the arts of statecraft, in the methods that 
the Sun King had perfected. Nothing was neglected in his education. But 
when Louis XV came to the throne, in 1726, a sudden change came over 
hirn: He no longer had to study or please others or prove hirnself. He stood 
alone at the top of a great country, with wealth and power at his command. 
He could do as he wished. 
In the first years of his reign, Louis gave hirns elf over to pleasure, leav­
ing the government in the hands of a trusted minister, Andre-Hercule de 
Fleury. This caused little concern, for he was a young man who needed to 
sow his wild oats, and de Fleury was a good minister. But it slowly became 
clear that this was more than a passing phase. Louis had no interest in gov­
erning. His main worry was not France's finances, or a possible war with 
Spain, but boredom. He could not stand being bored, and when he was not 
hunting deer, or chasing young girls, he whiled away bis time at the gam­
bling tables, losing huge sums in a single night. 
The court, as usual, reflected the tastes of the mler. Gambling and lav­
ish parties became the obsession. The courtiers had no concern with the fu­
ture of France-they poured their energies into charming the king, angling 
for tides that would bring them life pensions, and for cabinet positions de­
manding litde work but paying huge salaries. Parasites flocked to the court, 
and the state's debts swelled. 
In 1745 Louis fell in love with Madame de Pompadour, a woman of 
middle-class origin who had managed to rise through her charms, her intel­
ligence, and a good marriage . Madame de Pompadour became the official 
royal mistress; she also became France's arbiter of taste and fashion. But 
the Madame had political ambitions as weIl, and she eventually emerged 
as the country's unofficial prime minister-it was she, not Louis, who 
wielded hiring-and-firing power over France's most important ministers. 
As he grew older Louis only needed more diversion. On the grounds 
of Versailles he built a brothel, Parc aux Cerfs, which housed some of the 
prettiest young girls of France. Underground passages and hidden stair­
cases gave Louis access at all hours. Mter Madame de Pompadour died, in 
1764, she was succeeded as royal mistress by Madame du Barry, who soon 
came to dominate the court, and who, like de Pompadour before her, 
began to meddle in affairs of state. If a minister did not please her he would 
find himselffired. All ofEurope was aghast when du Barry, the daughter of 
a baker, managed to arrange the firing of Etienne de Choiseul, the foreign 
minister and France's most able diplomat. He had shown her too litde re­
spect. As time went by, swindlers and charlatans made their nests in Ver­
sailles, and enticed Louis's interest in astrology, the occult, and fraudulent 
business deals. The young and pampered teenager who had taken over 
France years before had only grown worse with age. 
The motto that became attached to Louis's reign was ''Apres moi, le 
deluge'!.-"After me the flood," or, Let France rot after I am gone. And in­
deed when Louis did go, in 1774, worn out by debauchery, his country and 
his own finances were in horrible disarray. His grandson Louis XVI inher­
ited arealm in desperate need of reform and a strong leader. But Louis 
XVI was even weaker than his grandfather, and could only watch as the 
country descended into revolut ion. In 1792 the republic introduced by the 
French Revolution declared the end of the monarchy, and gave the king a 
new name, "Louis the Last." A few months later he kneeled on the guillo­
tine, his about-to-be-severed head stripped of all the radiance and power 
that the Sun King had invested in the crown. 
Interpretation 
From a country that had descended into civil war in the late 1640s, Louis 
XIV forged the mightiest realm in Europe. Great generals would tremble 
in his presence. A cook once made amistake in preparing a dish and com­
mitted suicide rather than face the king's wrath. Louis XIV had many mis­
tresses, but their power ended in the bedroom. He filled his court with the 
most brilliant minds of the age. The symbol of his power was Versailles: 
Refusing to accept the palace of his forefathers, the Louvre, he built his 
own palace in what was then the middle of nowhere, symbolizing that this 
was a new order he had founded, one without precedent. He made Ver­
sailles the centerpiece of his reign, a place that all the powernd of Europe 
envied and visited with a sense of awe. In essence, Louis took a great 
void-the decaying monarchy of France-and filled it with his own sym­
bols and radiant power. 
Louis XV, on the other hand, symbolizes the fate of all those who in­
herit something large or who follow in a great man's footsteps. It would 
seem easy for a son or successor to build on the grand foundation left for 
them, but in the realm of power the opposite is true. The pampered, in­
dulged son alm ost always squanders the inheritan ce, for he does not start 
with the father's need to fill a void. As Machiavelli states, necessity is what 
impels men to take action, and once the necessity is gone, only rot and 
decay are left. Having no need to increase his store of power, Louis XV in­
evitably succumbed to inertia. Under him, Versailles, the symbol of the 
Sun King's authority, became a pleasure palace of incomparable banality, 
a kind of Las Vegas of the Bourbon monarchy. It came to represent all that 
the oppressed peasantry of France hated about their king, and during the 
Revolution they looted it with glee. 
Louis XV had only one way out of the trap awaiting the son or succes­
sor of a man like the Sun King: to psychologically begin from nothing, to LIF E OF PERICLES

OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW 
Alexander the Great had a dominant passion as a young man-an intense 
dislike for his father, King Philip of Macedonia. He hated Philip's cunning, 
cautious style of ruling, his bombastic speeches, his drinking and whoring, 
and his love of wrestling and of other wastes of time. Alexander knew he 
had to make hirnself the very opposite of his domineering father: He would 
force hirnself to be bold and reckless, he would control his tongue and be a 
man of few words, and he would not lose precious time in pursuit of plea­
sures that brought no glory. Alexander also resented the fact that Philip 
had conquered most of Greece: "My father will go on conquering till there 
is nothing extraordinary left for me to do," he once complain ed. While 
other sons of powerful men were content to inherit wealth and live a life of 
leisure, Alexander wanted only to outdo his father, to obliterate Philip's 
name from history by surpassing his accomplishments . 
Alexander itched to show others how superior he was to his father. A 
Thessalian horse-dealer once brought a prize horse named Bucepha lus to 
seIl to Philip. None of the king's grooms could get near the horse--it was 
far too savage-and Philip berated the merchant for bringing him such a 
useless be ast. Watching the whole affair, Alexander scowled and COffi­
mented, "What a horse they are losing for want of skill and spirit to man­
age hirn!" When he had said this several times, Philip had finally had 
enough, and challenged hirn to take on the horse. He called the merchant 
back, secretly hoping his son would have a nasty fall and leam a bitter les­
son. But Alexander was the one to teach the lesson: Not only did he mount 
Bucephal us, he managed to ride hirn at full gallop, taming the horse that 
would later carry hirn all the way to India. The courtiers applauded wildly, 
but Philip seethed inside, seeing not a son but a riyal to his power. 
Alexander's defiance of his father grew bolder. One day the two men 
had a heated argument before the entire court, and Philip drew his sword 
as if to strike his son; having drunk too much wine, however, the king 
stumbled. Alexander pointed at his father and jeered, "Men of Macedonia, 
see there the man who is preparing to pass from Europe to Asia. He cannot 
pass from one table to another without falling." 
When Alexander was eighteen, a disgruntled courtier murdered 
Philip. As word of the regicide spread through Greece, city after city rose 
up in rebellion against their Macedonian rulers. Philip's advisers counseled 
Alexan der, now the king, to proceed cautiously, to do as Philip had done 
and conquer through cunning. But Alexander would do things his way: He 
marched to the furthest reaches of the kingdom, suppressed the rebellious 
towns, and reunited the empire with brutal efficiency. 
As a young rebel grows older, his struggle against the father often 
wanes, and he gradually comes to resemble the very man he had wanted to 
defy. But Alexander' s loathing of his father did not end with Philip' s death. 
Once he had consolidated Greece, he set his eyes on Persia, the prize that 
had eluded his father, who had dreamed of conquering Asia. If he defeated 
the Persians, Alexander would finally surpass Philip in glory and fame. 
Alexander crossed into Asia with an army of 35,000 to face a Persian 
force numbering over a million. Before engaging the Persians in battle he 
passed through the town of Gordium. Here, in the town's main temple, 
there stood an ancient chariot tied with cords made of the rind of the cor­
nel tree. Legend had it that any man who could undo these cords--the 
Gordian knot-would rule the world. Many had tried to untie the enor­
mous and intricate knot, but none had succeeded. Alexander, seeing he 
could not possibly untie the knot with his bare hands, took out his sword 
and with one slash cut it in half. This symbolic ge sture showed the world 
that he would not do as others, but would blaze his own path. 
Against astounding odds, Alexander conquered the Persians. Most ex­
pected hirn to stop there-it was a great triumph, enough to secure his 
farne for etemity. But Alexander had the same relationship to his own 
deeds as he had to his father: His conquest of Persia represented the past, 
and he wanted never to rest on past triumphs, or to allow the past to out­
shine the present. He moved on to India, extending his empire beyond all 
known limits. Only his disgruntled and weary soldiers prevented hirn from 
going farther. 
Interpretati on 
Alexan der represents an extremely uncommon type in history: the son of 
a famous and successful man who manages to surpass the father in glory 
and power. The reason this type is uncommon is simple: The father most 
often manages to amass his fortune, his kingdom, because he begins with 
little or nothing. Adesperate urge impels hirn to succeed -he has nothing 
to lose by cunning and impetuousness, and has no famous father of his 
own to compete against. This kind of man has reason to believe in 
himself -to believe that his way of doing things is the best, because, after 
all, it worked for hirn. 
When a man like this has a son, he becomes domineering and oppres­
sive, imposing his lessons on the son, who is starting off life in circum­
stances totally different from those in which the father hirns elf began. the study ofhis profes­
sion. After painting had 
become second nature 
to him, Pietro's only 
pleasure was always to 
be w(Jrking in his aaft

to make money which

The son will never step out of his father's shadow unless he adopts the 
ruthless strategy of Alexander: disparage the past, create YOUf own king­

to renounce an inheritance-you can at least begin from ground zero psy­
chologically, by throwing off the weight of the past and charting a new di­
rection. Alexander instinctively recognized that privileges of birth are 
impediments to power. Be merciless With the past, then-not only with

KEYS TO POWER 
In many ancient kingdoms, for example Bengal and Sumatra, after the 
king had ruled for several years his subjects would execute hirn. This was 
done partly as a ritual of renewal, but also to prevent hirn from growing too 
powerful-for the king would generally try to establish a permanent order, 
at the expense of other families and of his own sons. Instead of protecting 
the tribe and leading it in times of war, he would attempt to dominate it. 
And so he would be beaten to death, or executed in an elaborate ritual. 
Now that he was no longer around for his honors to go to his head, he 
could be worshipped as a god_ Meanwhile the field had been cleared for a 
new and youthful order to establish itself. 
The ambivalent, hostile attitude towards the king or father figure also 
finds expression in legends of heroes who do not know their father. Moses, 
the archetyp al man of power, was found abandoned among the bulrushes 
and never knew his parents; without a father to compete with hirn or limit 
hirn, he could attain the heights of power. Hercules had no earthly father­
he was the son of the god Zeus. Later in his life Alexander the Great spread 
the story that the god Jupiter Ammon had sired hirn, not Philip of Mace­
don_ Legends and rituals like these eliminate the human father because he 
symbolizes the destructive power of the past 
The past prevents the young hero from creating his own world-he 
must do as his father did, even after that father is dead or powerless. The 
hero must bow and scrape before his predecessor and yield to tradition 
and precedent What had success in the past must be carried over to the 
present, even though circumsta nces have greatly changed. The past also 
weighs the hero down with an inheritance that he is terrified of losing, 
making hirn timid and cauti ous. 
Power depends on the ability to fill a void, to occupy a field that has 
been cleared of the dead weight of the past. Only after the father figure has 
been properly done away with will you have the necessary space to create 
and establish a new order. There are several strategies you can adopt to ac­
complish this-variations on the execution of the king that disguise the vio­
lence of the impulse by channeling it in socially acceptable forms. 
Perhaps the simplest way to escape the shadow of the past is simply to 
belittle it, playing on the timeless antagonism between the generations, stir­
ring up the young against the old. For this you need a convenient older fig­
ure to pillory. Mao Tse-tung, confronting a culture that fiercely resisted 
change, played on the suppressed resentment against the overbearing pres­
ence of the venerable Confucius in Chinese culture. John F. Kennedy 
knew the dangers of getting lost in the past; he radically distinguished his 
presidency from that of his predecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and also 
from the preceding decade, the 1950s, which Eisenhower personified. 
Kennedy, for instance, would not play the dull and fatherly game of golf­
asymbol ofretirement and privilege, and Eisenhower' s passion. Instead he 
played football on the White House lawn. In every aspect his administra­
tion represented vigor and youth, as opposed to the stodgy Eisenhow er. 
Kennedy had discovered an old truth: The young are easily set against the 
old, since they yearn to make their own place in the world and resent the 
shadow of their fathers. 
The distance you establish from your predecessor often demands 
some symbolism, a way of advertising itself publicly. Louis XIV, for exam­
pIe, created such symbolism when he rejected the traditional palace of the 
French kings and built his own palace of Versailles. King Philip 11 of Spain 
did the same when he created his center of power, the palace of EI Esco­
rial, in what was then the middle of nowhere. But Louis carried the game 
further: He would not be a king like his father or earlier ancestors, he 
would not wear a crown or carry a scepter or sit on a throne, he would es­
tablish a new kind of imposing authority with symbols and rituals of its 
own. Louis made his ancestors' rituals into laughable relics of the past. Fol­
low his example: Never let yourself be seen as following your predeces­
sor's path. If you do you will never surpass him. You must physically 
demonstrate your difference, by establishing a style and symbolism that 
sets you apart. 
The Roman emperor Augustus, successor to Julius Caesar, understood 
this thoroughly. Caesar had been a great general, a theatrical figure whose 
spectacles kept the Romans entertained, an international emissary seduced 
by the charms of Cleopa tra-a larger-than-life figure. So Augustus, despite 
bis own theatrical tendencies, competed with Caesar not by trying to outdo 
bim but by differentiating hirnself from hirn: He based his power on a re­
turn to Roman simplicity, an austerity of both style and substance. Against 
the memory of Caesar's sweeping presence Augustus posed a quiet and 
manly dignity. 
The problem with the overbearing predecessor is that he fills the vistas 
before you with symbols of the past. You have no room to create your own 
name. To deal with this situation you need to hunt out the vacuums-t hose cant that [nineteenth­

When Pericles of Athens was about to launch a career as astatesman,

indeed Pericles himself had aristocratic tendencies. Yet he decided to throw

arena filled with great leaders both past and present, he would make a 
name for himself where no shadows could obscure his presence. 
When the painter Diego de Veläzquez began his career, he knew he 
could not compete in refinement and technique with the great Renaissance 
painters who had come before him. Instead he chose to work in a style that 
by the standards of the time seemed coarse and rough, in a way that had 
never been seen before. And in this style he excelled. There were mem­
bers of the Spanish court who wanted to demonstrate their own break with 
the past; the newness of Veläzquez's style thrilled them. Most people are 
afraid to break so boldly with tradition, but they secretly admire those who 
can break up the old forms and reinvigorate the culture. This is why there 
is so much power to be gained from entering vacuums and voids. 
There is a kind of stubbom stupidity that recurs throughout history, 
and is a strong impediment to power: The superstitious belief that if the 
person before you succeeded by doing A, B, and C, you can re-create their 
success by doing the same thing. This cookie-cutter approach will seduce 
the uncreative, for it is easy, and appeals to their timidity and their laziness. 
But circumsta nces never repeat themselves exactly. 
When General Douglas MacArthur assumed command of American 
forces in the Philippin es during World War II, an assistant handed him a 
book containing the various precedents established by the commanders 
before hirn, the methods that had been successful for them. MacArthur 
asked the assistant how many copies there were of this book. Six, the assis­
tant answered. "WeIl," the general replied, "you get all those six copies to­
gether and bum them-every one of them. I'll not be . bound by 
precedents. Any time a problem comes up, I'll make the decision at 
once-immediately. " Adopt this ruthless strategy toward the past: Bum all 
the books, and train yourself to react to circumsta nces as they happen. 
You may believe that you have separated yourself from the predeces­
sor or father figure, but as you grow older you must be etemally vigilant 
lest you become the father you had rebelIed against. As a young man, Mao 
Tse-tung disliked his father and in the struggle against hirn found his own 
identity and a new set of values. But as he aged, his father's ways crept back 
in. Mao's father had valued manual work over intellect; Mao had scoffed at 
this as a young man, but as he grew older he unconsciously retumed to his 
father's views and echoed such outdated ideas by forcing a whole genera­
tion of Chinese intellectuals into manual labor, a nightrnarish mistake that 
cost his regime dearly. Remember: You are your own father. Do not let 
yourself spend years creating yourself only to let your guard down and 
allow the ghost of the past-father, habit, history-to sneak back in. 
Finally, as noted in the story of Louis XV, plenitude and prosperity 
tend to make us lazy and inactive: When our power is secure we have no 
need to act. This is a serious danger, especially for those who achieve suc­
cess and power at an early age. The playwright Tennessee Williarns, for in­
stance, found hirnself skyrocketed from obscu rity to farne by the success of 
The Glass Menagerie. "The sort of life which I had had previous to this popu­
lar success," he later wrote, "was one that required enduranc e, a life of 
clawing and scratching, but it was a good life because it was the sort of life 
for which the human organism is created. I was not aware of how much 
vital energy had gone into this struggle until the struggle was removed. 
This was security at last. I sat down and looked about me and was suddenly 
very depressed." Williarns had a nervous breakdown, which may in fact 
have been necessary for hirn: Pushed to the psychological edge, he could 
start writing with the old vitality again, and he produced A Streetcar Named 
Desire. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, similarly, whenever he wrote a successful 
novel, would feel that the financial security he had gained made the act of 
creation unnecessary. He would take his entire savings to the casino and 
would not leave until he had garnbled away his last penny. Once reduced 
to poverty he could write again. 
It is not necessary to go to such extremes, but you must be prepared to 
return to square one psychologically rather than growing fat and lazy with 
prosperity. Pablo Picasso could deal with success, but only by constantly 
changing the style of his painting, often breaking completely with what 
had made hirn successful before. How often our early triumphs turn us 
into a kind of caricature of ourselves. Powerful people recognize these 
traps; like Alexander the Great, they struggle constantly to re-create them­
selves. The father must not be allowed to return; he must be slain at every 
step of the way. 
Image: The Father. He casts a 
giant shadow over his children, 
keeping them in thrall long 
after he is gone by tying them 
to the past, squashing their 
youthful spirit, and forcing 
them down the same tired path 
he followed hirnself. His tricks 
are many. At every cross­
roads you must slay the father 
and step out of his shadow.

weB traveled. The newest ones can be 
arduous, but they are often shortcuts to 
greatness. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) 
The shadow of a great predecessor could be used to advantage if it is cho­
sen as a trick, a tactic that can be discarded once it has brought you power. 
Napoleon III used the name and legend of his illustrious grand-unde 
Napoleon Bonaparte to help hirn become first president and then emperor 
of France. Once on the throne, however, he did not stay tied to the past; he 
quickly showed how different his reign would be, and was careful to keep 
the public from expecting hirn to attain the heights that Bonaparte had at­
tained. 
The past often has elements worth appropriating, qualities that would 
be foolish to reject out of a need to distinguish yourself. Even Alexander 
the Great recognized and was influenced by his father's skill in organizing 
an army. Making a display of doing things differently from your predeces­
sor can make you seem childish and in fact out of control, unless your ac­
tions have a logic of their OWll. 
Joseph 11, son of the Austrian empress Maria Theresa, made a show of 
doing the exact opposite of his mother-dressing like an ordinary citizen, 
staying in inns instead of palaces, appearing as the "people's emperor." 
Maria Theresa, on the other hand, had been regal and aristocratic. The 
problem was that she had also been beloved, an empress who mIed wisely 
after years of learning the hard way. If you have the kind of intelligence 
and instinct that will point you in the right direction, playing the rebel will 
not be danger ous. But if you are mediocre, as Joseph II was in comparison 
to his mother, you are better off leaming from your predecessor's knowl­
edge and experience, which are based on something real. 
Finally, it is often wise to keep an eye on the young, YOUf future rivals 
in power. Just as you try to rid yourself of your father, they will soon play 
the same trick on you, denigrating everything you have accompli shed. Just 
as you rise by rebelling against the past, keep an eye on those rising from 
below, and never give them the chance to do the same to you. 
The great Baroque artist and architect Pietro Bemini was a master at 
sniffing out younger potential rivals and keeping them in his shadow. One 
day a young stonemason named Francesco Borromini showed Bemini his 
architectural sketche s. Recognizing his talent immediately, Bemini in­
stantly hired Borromini as his assistant, which delighted the young man but 
was actually only a tactic to keep him elose at hand, so that he could play 
psychological games on him and create in hirn a kind of inferiority com­
plex. And indeed, despite Borromini's brilliance, Bemini has the greater 
farne. His strategy with Borromini he made a lifelong practice: Fearing that 
the great sculptor Alessandro Algardi, for example, would eelipse hirn in 
farne, he arranged it so that Algardi could only find work as his assistant . 
And any assistant who rebelled against Bemini and tried to strike out on 
his own would find his career ruined.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW I 
Near the end of the sixth century B.C., the city-state of Athens overthrew 
the series of petty tyrants who had dominated its politics for decades. It es­
tablished instead a democracy that was to last over a century, a democ­
racy that became the source of its power and its proudest achievement. 
But as the democracy evolved, so did a problem the Athenians had never 
faced: How to deal with those who did not concern themselves with the 
cohesion of a small city surrounded by enemies, who did not work for its 
greater glory, but thought of only themselves and their own ambitions and 
petty intrig ues? The Athenians understood that these people, if left alone, 
would sow dissension, divide the city into factions, and stir up anxieties, 
all of which could lead to the ruin of their democracy. 
Violent punishment no longer suited the new, civilized order that 
Athens had created. Instead the citizens found another, more satisfying, 
and less brutal way to deal with the chronically selfish: Every year they 
would gather in the marketplace and write on a piece of earthenware, an 
ostrakon, the name of an individual they wanted to see banished from the 
city for ten years. If a particular name appeared on six thousand ballots, 
that person would instantly be exiled. If no one received six thousand 
votes, the person with the most ostraka recording his name would suffer 
the ten-year "ostracism." This ritual expulsion became a kind of festival­
what a joy to be able to banish those irritating, anxiety-inducing individu­
als who wanted to rise above the group they should have served. 
In 490 B.C., Aristides, one of the great generals of Athenian history, 
helped defeat the Persians at the battle of Marathon. Meanwhile, off the 
battlefield, his fairness as a judge had eamed hirn the nickname "The 
Just." But as the years went by the Athenians came to dislike hirn. He 
made such a show of his righteousness, and this, they believed, disguised 
his feelings of superiority and scorn for the common folk. His omnipres­
ence in Athenian politics became obnoxious; the citizens grew tired of 
hearing hirn called "The Just." They feared that this was just the type of 
man-judgmental, haughty-who would eventually stir up fierce divi­
sions among them. In 482 B.C., despite Aristides' invaluable expertise in 
the continuing war with the Persians, they collected the ostraka and had 
hirn banished. 
After Aristides' ostracism, the great general Themistoeles emerged as 
the city's premier leader. But his many honors and victories went to his 
head, and he too became arrogant and overbearing, constantly reminding 
the Athenians of his triumphs in battle, the temples he had built, the dan­
gers he had fended off. He seemed to be saying that without hirn the city 
would come to ruin. And so, in 472 B.C., Themistoeles' name was filled in 
on the ostraka and the city was rid of his poisonous presence. 
The greatest political figure in fifth-century Athens was undoubtedly 
Perieles. Although several times threatened with ostracism, he avoided 
that fate by maintaining elose ties with the people. Perhaps he had leamed 
a lesson as a child from his favorite tutor, the incomparable Damon, who TlIE (:()\\HII'�ST OF 1'1,:111

360 LAW 42 excelled above all other Athenians in his intelligence, his musical skills, 
and his rhetorical abilities. It was Damon who had trained Pericles in the 
arts of ruling. But he, too, suffered ostracism, for his superior airs and his 
insulting manner toward the commoners stirred up too much resentment. 
Toward the end of the century there lived a man named Hyperbolus. 
Most writers of the time describe hirn as the city's most worthless cit izen: 
He did not care what anyone thought of hirn, and slandered whomever he 
disliked. He amused some, but irritated many more. In 417 B.C., Hyperbo­
lus saw an opportunity to stir up anger against the two leading politicians 
of the time, Alcibiades and Nicias. He hoped that one of the two would be 
ostracized and that he would rise in that man's place. His campaign 
seemed likely to succeed: The Athenians disliked Alcibiades' flamboyant 
and carefree lifestyle, and were wary of Nicias' wealth and aloofness. 
They seemed certain to ostracize one or the other. But Alcibiades and 
Nicias, aIthough they were otherwise enemies, pooled their resources and 
managed to turn the ostracism on Hyperbolus instead. His obnoxious­
ness, they argued, could only be terminated by banishment. 
Earlier sufferers of ostracism had been formidable, powernIl men. 
Hyperbolus, however, was a low buffo on, and with his banishment the 
Athenians feit that ostracism had been degraded. And so they ended the 
practice that for nearly a hundred years had been one of the keys to keep­
ing the peace within Athens. 
Interpretation 
The ancient Athenians had social instincts unknown today-the passage 
of centuries has blunted them. Citizens in the true sense of the word, the 
Athenians sensed the dangers posed by asocial behavior, and saw how 
such behavior often disguises itself in other forms: the holier-than-thou at­
titude that silently seeks to impose its standards on others; overweening 
ambition at the expense of the common good; the flaunting of superiority; 
quiet scheming; terminal obnoxiousness. Some of these behaviors would 
eat away at the city's cohesion by creating factions and sowing dissension, 
others would ruin the democratic spirit by making the common citizen 
feel inferior and envious. The Athenians did not try to reeducate people 
who acted in these ways, or to absorb them somehow into the group, or to 
impose a violent punishment that would only create other problems. The 
solution was quick and effective: Get rid of them. 
Within any group, trouble can most often be traced to a single source, 
the unhappy, chronically dissatisfied one who will always stir up dissen­
sion and infect the group with his or her ill ease. Before you know what hit 
you the dissatisfaction spreads. Act before it becomes impossible to disen­
tangle one strand of misery from another, or to see how the whole thing 
started. First, recognize troublemakers by their overbearing presence, or 
by their complaining nature. Once you spot them do not try to reform 
them or appease them-that will only make things worse. Do not attack 
them, whether directly or indirectly, for they are poisonous in nature and 
will work underground to destroy you. Do as the Athenians did: Banish 
them before it is too late. Separate them from the group before they be­
come the eye of a whirlpool. Do not give them time to stir up anxieties 
and sow discontent; do not give them room to move. Let one person suf­
fer so that the rest can live in peace.

OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW II 
In 1296 the cardinals of the Catholic Church met in Rome to select a new 
pope. They chose Cardinal Gaetani, for he was incomparably shrewd; 
such a man would make the Vatican a great power. Taking the name Boni­
face VIII, Gaetani so on proved he deserved the cardina ls' high opinion of 
hirn: He plotted his moves carefully in advanc e, and stopped at nothing to 
get his way. Once in power, Boniface quickly crushed his rivals and uni­
fied the Papal States. The European powers began to fear hirn, and sent 
delegate s to negotiate with hirn. The German King Albrecht of Austria 
even yielded some territory to Boniface. All was proceeding according to 
the pope's plan. 
One piece did not fall into place, however, and that was Tuscany, the 
richest part of Italy. If Boniface could conquer Florence, Tuscany's most 
powerful city, the region would be his. But Florence was a proud repu blic, 
and would be hard to defeat. The pope had to play his cards skillfully. 
Florence was divided by two riyal factions, the Blacks and the Whites. 
The Whites were the merchant families that had recently and quickly 
risen to power and wealth; the Blacks were the older money. Because of 
their popularity with the people, the Whites retained control of the city, to 
the Blacks' increasing resentment. The feud between the two grew steadily 
more bitter. 
Here Boniface saw his chance: He would plot to help the Blacks take 
over the city, and Florence would be in his pocket. And as he studied the 
situation he began to focus on one man, Dante Alighieri, the celebrated 
writer, poet, and ardent supporter of the Whites. Dante had always been 
interested in politics. He believed passionately in the republic, and often 
chastised his fellow citizens for their lack of spine. He also happened to be 
the city's most eloquent public speaker. In 1300, the year Boniface began 
plotting to take over Tuscany, Dante's fellow citizens had voted him in to 
Florence's highest elected position, making hirn one of the city's six pri­
ors. During his six-month term in the post, he had stood firmly against the 
Blacks and against all of the pope's attempts to sow disorder. 
By 1301, however, Boniface had a new plan: He called in Charles de 
Valois, powerful brother of the king of France, to help bring order to Tus­
cany. As Charles marched throug h northern Italy, and Florence seethed 
with anxiety and fear, Dante quickly emerged as the man who could rally THE WOLVES ,\ "D

362 LAW 42 the people, arguing vehemently against appeasement and working desper­
ately to arm the citizens and to organize resistance against the pope and 
his puppet French prince. By hook or by crook, Boniface had to neutralize 
Dante. And so, even as on the one hand he threatened Florence with 
Charles de Valois, on the other he held out the olive branch, the possibil­
ity of negotiations, hoping Dante would take the bait. And indeed the Flo­
rentines decided to send adelegation to Rome and try to negotiate a 
peace. To head the mission, predictably, they chose Dante. 
So me wamed the poet that the wily pope was setting up a trap to lure 
hirn away, but Dante went to Rome anyway, arriving as the French army 
stood before the gates of Florence. He feIt sure that his eloquence and rea­
son would win the pope over and save the city. Yet when the pope met the 
poet and the Florentine delegates, he instantly intimidated them, as he did 
so many. "Fall on your knees before me!" he bellowed at their first meet­
ing. "Submit to met I tell you that in all truth I have nothing in my heart 
but to promote your peace." Succumbing to his powerful presence, the 
Florentin es listened as the pope promised to look after their interests. He 
then advised them to return horne, leaving one of their members behind 
to continue the talks. Boniface signaled that the man to stay was to be 
Dante. He spoke with the utmost politeness, but in essence it was an order. 
And so Dante remained in Rome. And while he and the pope contin­
ued their dialogue, Florence fell apart. With no one to rally the Whites, 
and with Charles de Valois using the pope's money to bribe and sow dis­
sension, the Whites disintegrate d, some arguing for negotiations, others 
switching sides. Facing an enemy now divided and unsure of itself, the 
Blacks easily destroyed them within weeks, exacting violent revenge on 
them. And once the Blacks stood firmly in power, the pope finally dis­
missed Dante from Rome. 
The Blacks ordered Dante to return horne to face accusations and 
stand trial. When the poet refused, the Blacks condemned hirn to be 
burned to death if he ever set foot in Florence again. And so Dante began 
a miserable life of exile, wandering through Italy, disgraced in the city that 
he loved, never to return to Florence, even after his death. 
Interpretation 
Boniface knew that if he only had apretext to lure Dante away, Florence 
would crumble. He played the oldest card in the book-threatening with 
one hand while holding out the olive branch with the other-and Dante 
fell for it. Once the poet was in Rome, the pope kept hirn there for as long 
as it took. For Boniface understood one of the principal precepts in the 
game of power: One resolute person, one disobedient spirit, can turn a 
flock of sheep into a den of lions. So he isolated the troublemaker. With­
out the backbone of the city to keep them together, the sheep quickly 
scattered. 
Leam the lesson: Do not waste your time lashing out in all directions 
at what seems to be a many-headed enemy. Find the one head that mat-
ters-the person with willpower, or smarts, or, most important of all, 
charisma. Whatever it costs you, lure this person away, for once he is ab­
sent his powers will lose their effect. His isolation can be physical (banish­
ment or absence from the court), political (narrowing his base of support), 
or psychological (alienating hirn from the group through slander and in­
sinuation). Cancer begins with a single cell; excise it before it spreads be­
yond cure. 
KEYS TO POWER 
In the past, an entire nation would be ruled by a king and his handful of 
ministers. Only the elite had any power to play with. Over the centuries, 
power has gradually become more and more diffused and democrat ized. 
This has created, however, a common misperception that groups no 
longer have centers of power -that power is spread out and scattered 
among many people. Actually, however, power has changed in its num­
bers but not in its essence. There may be fewer mighty tyrants command­
ing the power of life and death over millions, but there remain thousands 
of petty tyrants ruling smaller realms, and enforcing their will through in­
direct power games, charisma, and so on. In every group, power is con­
centrated in the hands of one or two people, for this is one area in which 
human nature will never change: People will congregate around a single 
strong personality like planets orbiting a sun. 
To labor under the illusion that this kind of power center no longer 
exists is to make endless mistakes, waste energy and time, and never hit 
the target. Powerful people never waste time. Outwardly they may play 
along with the game-p retending that power is shared among many-but 
inwardly they keep their eyes on the inevitable few in the group who hold 
the cards. These are the ones they work on. When troubles arise, they 
look for the underlying cause, the single strong character who started the 
stirring and whose isolation or banishment will settle the waters again. 
In his family-therapy practice, Dr. Milton H. Erickson found that if 
the family dynamic was unsetded and dysfunctional there was inevitably 
one person who was the stirrer, the troublemaker. In his sessions he would 
symbolically isolate this rotten apple by seating hirn or her apart from the 
others, if only by a few feet. Slowly the other family members would see 
the physically separate person as the source of their difficulty. Once you 
recognize who the stirrer is, pointing it out to other people will accomplish 
a great deal. Understanding who controls the group dynamic is a critical 
realization. Remember: Stirrers thrive by hiding in the group, disguising 
their actions among the reactions of others. Render their actions visible 
and they lose their power to upset. 
A key element in games of strategy is isolating the enemy's power. In 
chess you try to corner the king. In the Chinese game of go you try to iso­
late the enemy's forces in small pockets, rendering them immobile and in­
effectual. It is often better to isolate your enemies than to destroy 
LAW 42 363 
364 LAW 42 them-you seem less brutal. The result, though, is the same, for in the 
game of power, isolation spells death. 
The most effective form of isolation is somehow to separate your vic­
tims from their power base. When Mao Tse-tung wanted to eliminate an 
enemy in the ruling elite, he did not confront the person directly ; he 
silently and stealthily worked to isolate the man, divide his allies and turn 
them away from hirn, shrink his support. Soon the man would vanish on 
his own. 
Presence and appearance have great import in the game of power. To 
seduce, particularly in the beginning stages, you need to be constantly 
present, or create the feeling that you are; if you are often out of sight, the 
charm will wear off. Queen Elizabeth's prime minister, Robert Cecil, 
had two main rivals: the queen's favorite, the Earl of Essex, and her for­
mer favorite, Sir Walter Raleigh. He contrived to send them both on a 
mission against Spain; with them away from the court he managed to 
wrap his tentacles around the queen, seeure his position as her top ad­
viser and weaken her affection for Raleigh and the earl. The lesson here 
is twofold: First, your absence from the court spells danger for you, and 
you should never leave the scene in a time of turmoil, for your absence 
can both symbolize and induce a loss of power; second, and on the other 
hand, luring your enemies away from the court at critical moments is a 
great ploy. 
Isolation has other strategie uses. When trying to seduce people, it is 
often wise to isolate them from their usual social context. Once isolated 
they are vulnerable to you, and your presence becomes magnifi ed. Simi­
larly, con artists often look for ways to isolate their marks from their nor­
mal social milieux, steering them into new environments in which they 
are no longer comforta ble. Here they feel weak, and succumb to decep­
tion more easily. Isolation, then, can prove a powernd way of bringing 
people under your spell to seduce or swindle them. 
You will often find powerful people who have alienated themselves 
from the group. Perhaps their power has gone to their heads, and they 
consider themselves superior; perhaps they have lost the knack of com­
municating with ordinary folk. Remember: This makes them vulnerable. 
Powernd though they be, people like this can be tumed to use. 
The monk Rasputin gained his power over Czar Nicholas and Czar­
ina Alexandra of Russia through their tremendous isolation from the peo­
pIe. Alexandra in particular was a foreigner, and especially alienated 
from everyday Russians; Rasputin used his peasant origins to insinuate 
hirnself into her good graces, for she despera tely wanted to communic ate 
with her subjects. Once in the court's inner circle, Rasputin made hirnself 
indispensable and attained great power. Heading straight for the center, 
he aimed for the one figure in Russia who commanded power (the czarina 
dominated her husband) , and found he had no need to isolate her for the 
work was already done. The Rasputin strategy can bring you great power: 
Always search out people who hold high positions yet who find them-
selves isolated on the board. They are like apples falling into your lap, 
easily seduced, and able to catapult you into power yourself. 
Finally, the reason you strike at the shepherd is because such an ac­
tion will dishearten the sheep beyond any rational measure. When Her­
nando Cortes and Francisco Pizarro led their tiny forces against the Aztec 
and Incan empires, they did not make the mistake of fighting on several 
fronts, nor were they intimidated by the numbers arrayed against them; 
they captured the kings, Moctezuma and Atahualpa. Vast empires fell 
into their hands. With the leader gone the center of gravity is gone; there 
is nothing to revolve around and everything falls apart. Aim at the lead­
ers, bring them down, and look for the endless opportunities in the confu­
sion that will ensue. 
Image: A Flock of Fatted 
Sheep. Do not waste precious 
time trying to steal a sheep or two; do 
not risk life and limb by setting upon 
the dogs that guard the flock. Aim at the 
shepherd. Lure hirn away and the dogs 
will follow. Strike hirn down and the flock will 
scatter- you can pick them off one by one. 
Authority : If you draw a bow, draw the 
strongest. If you use an arrow, use the long­

To catch a gang of bandits, first capture 
its leader. Just as a country has its 
border, so the killing of men has its limits. If 
the enemy's attack can be stopped [with a 
blow to the headJ, why have any more dead 
and wounded than necessary? (Chinese 
poet Tu Fu, Tang dynasty, eighth century)

366 LAW 42 REVERSAL 
"Any harm you do to a man should be done in such a way that you need 
not fear his reveng e," writes Machiavelli. If you act to isolate your enemy, 
make sure he lacks the me ans to repay the favor. If you apply this Law, in 
other words, apply it from a position of superiority, so that you have noth­
ing to fear from his resentment. 
Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln's successor as V.S. president, 
saw Ulysses S. Grant as a troublesome member of his govemment. So he 
isolated Grant, as aprelude to forcing him out. This only enraged the 
great general, however, who responded by forming a support base in the 
Republican party and going on to become the next president. It would 
have been far wiser to keep a man like Grant in the fold, where he could 
do less harm, than to make him revengeful. And so you may often find it 
better to keep people on your side, where you can watch them, than to 
risk creating an angry enemy. Keeping them dose, you can secredy whit­
de away at their support base, so that when the time comes to cut them 
loose they will fall fast and hard without knowing what hit them.

368 LAW 43 TRAN SGRESSION OF THE LAW 
Near the end of the reign of Louis XV, all of France seemed despera te for 
change, When the king' s grandson and chosen successor, the future Louis 
XVI, marri ed the fifteen-year-old daughter of the empress of Austria, the 
French caught a glimp se of the future that seemed hopeful. The young 
bride, Marie-Antoinette, was beautiful and fuH of life. She instantly 
changed the mood of the court, which was rank with Louis XV's de­
bauch eries; even the common people, who had yet to see her, talked excit­
edly of Marie-Antoinette . The French had grown disgusted with the series 
of mistresses who had dominated Louis XV, and they looked forward to 
serving their new queen. In 1773, when Marie-Antoinette publicly rode 
through the streets of Paris for the first time, applauding crowds swarmed 
around her carriage . "How fortunate ," she wrote her mother, "to be in a 
position in which one can gain widespread aff ection at so little cost." 
In 1774 Louis XV died and Louis XVI took the throne. As soon as 
Marie-Antoinette became queen she abandoned herself to the pleasures 
she loved the most--ordering and wearing the most expensive gowns and 
jewelry in the realm; sporting the most elaborate hair in history, her 
sculpted coiffures rising as much as three feet above her head; and throwing 
a constant succession of masked balls and fe tes. All of these whims she paid 
for on credit, never concerning herself with the cost or who paid the bills. 
Marie-Antoinette 's greatest pleasure was the creation and designing of 
a private Garden of Eden at the Petit Trianon, a chateau on the grounds of 
VersaiHes with its own woods. The gardens at the Petit Trianon were to be 
as "natural" as possible, including moss applied by hand to the trees and 
rocks. To heighten the pastoral effect, the queen employed peasant milk­
maids to milk the finest-Iooking cows in the realm; launderers and cheese­
makers in special peasant outfits she helped design ; shepherds to tend 
sheep with silk ribbons around their necks. When she inspected the barns, 
she would watch her milkmaids squeezing milk into porcelain vases made 
at the royal ceramic works. To pass the time, Marie-Antoinette would 
gather flowers in the woods around the Petit Trianon, or watch her "good 
pe asants" doing their "chores ." The place became aseparate world, its 
community limited to her chosen favorites. 
With each new whim, the cost of maintaining the Petit Trianon soared. 
Meanwhile, France itself was deteriorating: There was famine and wide­
spread discontent. Even socially insulated courtiers seethed with resent­
ment-th e queen treated them like children. Only her favorites mattered, 
and these were becoming fewer and fewer. But Marie-Antoinette did not 
concern herself with this. Not once throughout her reign did she read a 
minist er's report. Not once did she tour the provin ces and rally the people 
to her side. Not once did she mingle among the Parisians, or receive a del­
egation from them. She did none of these things because as queen she feit 
the people owed her their affection, and she was not required to love them 
in return. 
In 1784 the queen became embroiled in a scandal. As part of an elabo­
rate swindl e, the most expensive diamond necklace in Europe had been 
purchased under her name, ang during the swindlers' trial her lavish 
lifestyle became public: People heard about the money she spent on jewels 
and dresses and masked dances. They gave her the nickname "Madame 
Deficit," and from then on she became the focus of the people's growing 
resentment. When she appeared in her box at the opera the audience 
greeted her with hisses. Even the court turned against her. For while she 
had been running up her huge expenditures, the country was headed for 
ruin. 
Five years later, in 1789, an unprecedented event took place: the be­
ginning of the French Revolution. The queen did not worry-Iet the peo­
pIe have their little rebellion, she seemed to think; it would soon quiet 
down and she would be able to resurne her life of pleasure. That year the 
people marched on Versailles, forcing the royal family to quit the palace 
and take residence in Paris. This was a triumph for the rebels, but it offered 
the queen an opportunity to heal the wounds she had opened and establish 
contact with the people. The queen, however, had not learned her lesson: 
Not once would she leave the palace during her stay in Paris. Her subjects 
could rot in heU for all she cared. 
In 1792 the royal couple was moved from the palace to a prison, as the 
revolution officially declared the end of the monarchy. The following year 
Louis XVI was tried, found guilty, and guillotined. As Marie-Antoinette 
awaited the same fate, hardly a soul came to her defense--not one of her 
former friends in the court, not one of Europe's other monarchs (who, as 
members of their own countries' royal farnilies, had all the reason in the 
world to show that revolution did not pay), not even her own family in 
Austria, including her brother, who now sat on the throne. She had be­
come the world's pariah. In October of 1793, she finally knelt at the guillo­
tine, unrepentant and defiant to the bitter end. 
Interpretation 
From early on, Marie-Antoinette acquired the most dangerous of attitudes: 
As a young princess in Austria she was endlessly flattered and cajoled. As 
the future queen of the French court she was the center of everyone 's atten­
tion. She never learned to charm or please other people, to become at­
tuned to their individual psycholog ies. She never had to work to get her 
way, to use calculation or cunning or the arts of persuasion. And like every­
one who is indulged from an early age, she evolved into a monster of in­
sensitivity. 
Marie-Antoinette became the focus of an entire country's dissatisfac­
tion because it is so infuriating to meet with a person who makes no effort 
to seduce you or attempt to persuade you, even if only for the purpose of 
deception. And do not imagine that she represents a bygone era, or that 
she is even rare. Her type is today more common than ever. Such types live 
in their own bubble--they seem to feel they are born kings and queens, 
and that attention is owed them. They do not consider anyone else's na­
ture, but bulldoze over people with the self-righteous arrogance of a Marie­
Antoinette . Pampered and indulged as children, as adults they still believe told to si! down on the 
grass and enjoy 
themselves. After the 
meal Cyrus asked them 
which they preferred­
yesterday 's work or 
today's amusement ; 
and they replied that it 
was indeed a far cry 
from the previous day's 
misery to their present 
pleasures. This was the 
ans wer which Cyrus 
wanted; he seized upon 
it at once and 
proceeded to lay bare 
what he had in mind. 
"Men of Persia," he 
said, "listen to me: obey 
my orders, and you will 
be able to enjoy a thou­
sand pleasures as good 
as this wi!hout ever 
turning your hands to 
meniallabor; but, if 
you disobey, yester­
day's task will be the 
pattern of innumerable 
others you will be 
forced to perform. Take 
my advice and win 
your freedom. I am the 
man destined to under­
take your liberation, 
and it is my belief that 
you are a match for the 
Medes in war as in 
everything else. lt is the 
truth I tell you. Do not 
delay, but jling off the 
yoke of Astyages at 
once." 
The Persians had long 
resented their subjec­
tion to the Medes. At 
last they had found a 
leader, and welcomed 
with enthusiasm the 
prospect of liberty .. 
On the present occasion 
the Persians under 
Cyrus rose against the 
Medes and from then 
onwards were masters 
ofAsia.

OBSER VAN CE OF THE LAW 
In A.D. 225, Chuko Liang, master strategist and chief minister to the mler 
of Shu in ancient China, confronted a dangerous situa tion. The kingdom of 
Wei had mounted an all-out attack on Shu from the north. More dangerous 
still, Wei had formed an alliance with the barbarous states to the south of 
Shu, led by King Meng huo. Chuko Liang had to deal with this second 
menace from the south before he could hope to fend off Wei in the north. 
As Chuko Liang prepared to march south against the barbarians, a 
wise man in his camp offered hirn adv ice. It would be impossible, this man 
said, to pacify the region by force. Liang would probably beat Menghuo, 
but as soon as he headed north again to deal with Wei, Menghuo would 
reinva de. "It is better to win hearts ," said the wise man, "than cit ies; better 
to battle with hearts than with weapons. I hope you will succeed in winning 
the hearts of these people." "You read my thoug hts," responded Chuko 
Liang. 
As Liang expected, Menghuo launch ed a powernd attack. But Liang 
laid a trap and managed to capture a large part ofMenghu o's army, includ­
ing the king hirnself. Instead of punishing or executing his prisoners, how­
ever, he separated the soldiers from their king, had their shackles removed, 
regaled them with food and wine, and then addressed them. "You are all 
upright men," he said. "I believe you all have parents, wives, and children 
waiting for you at horne. They are doubtl ess shedding bitter tears at your 
fate. I am going to release you, so that you can return horne to YOUf loved 
ones and comfort them." The men thanked Liang with tears in their eyes; 
then he sent for Mengh uo. "If I release you," asked Liang, "what will you 
do?" "I will pull my army together again," answered the king, "and lead it 
against you to a decisive battle. But if you capture me a second time, I will 
bow to your superiori ty." Not only did Liang order Menghuo released, he 
gave hirn a gift of a horse and saddle. When angry lieutenants wondered 
why he did this, Liang told them, "I can capture that man as easily as I can 
take somet hing out of my pocket. I am trying to win his heart. When I do, 
peace will come of itself here in the south ." 
As Menghuo had said he would, he attacked again . But his own offi­
cers, whom Liang had treated so weIl, rebelIed against hirn, captured hirn, 
and turned hirn over to Liang, who asked hirn again the same question as 
before. Menghuo replied that he had not been beaten fairly, but merely be­
trayed by his own officers; he would fight aga in, but if captured a third time 
he would bow to Liang's superio rity. 
Over the following months Liang outwitte d Menghuo again and again, 
capturing hirn a thir d, a fourth, and a fifth time. On each occasion Meng­
huo's troops grew more dissa tisfi ed. Liang had treated them with respect; 
they had lost their heart for fighting. But every time Chuko Liang asked 
Menghuo to yield, the great king would come up with another excuse: You 
tricked me, 1 lost through bad luck, on and on. If you capture me again, 
he would promise, 1 swear 1 will not betray you. And so Liang would let 
him go. 
When he captured Menghuo for the sixth time, he asked the king the 
same question aga in. "If you capture me a seventh time," the king replied, 
"I shall give you my loyalty and never rebel again ." "Very weIl," said 
Liang. "But if I capture you again , 1 will not release you." 
Now Menghuo and his soldiers fled to a far corner of their king dom, 
the region of Wuge . Defeated so many times, Menghuo had only one hope 
left: He would ask the help of King Wu tugu of Wu ge, who had an immense 
and ferocious army. Wut ugu's warriors wore an armor of tightly woven 
vines soaked in oil, then dried to an impenetrable hard ness. With 
Menghuo at his side, Wu tugu march ed this mighty army aga inst Liang, and 
this time the great strategist seemed fright ened, leading his men in a hur­
ried retreat. But he was merely leading Wu tugu into a trap : He cornered 
the king's men in a narrow valley, then lit fires set all around them . When 
the fires reached the soldiers Wutug u's whole army burst into flame-the 
oil in their armor, of course, being highly flamm able. All of them perished. 
Liang had managed to sepa rate Menghuo and his entourage from the 
carnage in the valley, and the king found hirnself a captive for the seventh 
time . After this slaughter Liang could not bear to face his prisoner again . 
He sent a messenger to the captured king: "He has commissioned me to re­
lease you. Mobilize another army aga inst hirn, if you can, and try once 
more to defeat hirn." Sobbing, the king fell to the ground, crawled to Liang 
on his hands and kne es, and prostrated hirnself at his feet. "Oh great minis­
ter," cried Menghuo, "yours is the majesty of Heaven. We men of the south 
will never again offer resistance to your rule." "Do you now yield ?" asked 
Liang. "I, my sons, and my grandsons are deeply moved by Your Honor's 
boundl ess, life-giving mercy. How could we not yield?" 
Liang honored Menghuo with a great banquet, reestablished hirn on 
the throne, restored his conquered lands to his rule, then returned north 
with his army, leaving no occupying force. Liang never came back-he had 
no need to: Menghuo had become his most devoted and unshakable ally. 
Interpretation 
Chuko Liang had two options: Try to defeat the barbarians in the south 
with one crushing blow, or patiently and slowly win them to his side over 
time. Most people more powernIl than their enemy grab the first option 
and never consider the second, but the truly powerful think far ahead : The The men who have 
changed the universe 
have never gotten there 
by w(Jrking on leaders, 
but rather by moving 
the masses. Working on 
leaders is the method of 
intrigue and only leads 
to secondary results. 
Working on the masses, 
however , is the strake 
of genius that changes 
the face of the world.

KEYS TO POWER 
In the game of power, you are surrou nded by people who have absol utely 
no reason to help you unless it is in their interest to do so. And if you have 
nothing to offer their self-interest, you are likely to make them hostile, for 
they will see in you just one more competitor, one more waster of their 
time. Those that overcome this prevailing coldness are the ones who find 
the key that unlocks the stranger's heart and mind, seducing hirn into their 
corner, if necessary softening hirn up for a punch. But most people never 
leam this side of the game. When they meet someone new, rather than 
stepping back and probing to see what makes this person unique, they talk 
about them selves, eager to irnpose their own willpower and prejudices. 
They argu e, boast, and make a show of their power. They may not know it 
but they are secretly creating an enemy, aresister, because there is no 
more infuriating feeling than having your individuality igno red, your own 
psychology unac knowledged. It makes you feellifeless and resentful . 
Remember: The key to persuasion is softening people up and break­
ing them down, gently. Seduce them with a two-pronged approach : Work 
on their emotions and play on their intellectual weak nesses. Be alert to 
both what separates them from everyone else (their individual psychol ogy) 
and what they share with everyone else (their basic emotional responses) . 
Aim at the primary emotions-Iov e, hate, jealousy. Once you move their 
emotions you have reduced their control, making them more vulnerable to 
persuasion. 
When Chuko Liang wanted to dissuade an important general of a rival 
kingdom from entering into an alliance with Ts'ao Ts'ao, Liang's dreade d 
enemy, he did not detail Ts'ao Ts'ao's cruelty, or attack him on moral 
groun ds. Instead Liang suggested that Ts'ao Ts'ao was really after the gen-
eral's beautiful young wife . This hit the general in the gut, and won hirn 
over. Mao Tse-tung similarly always appealed to popular emotions, and 
spoke in the simplest terms. Educated and well-read hirnse lf, in his 
speeches he used visceral metaph ors, voicing the pub lic's deepest anxieties 
and enc ouraging them to vent their frustra tions in public meetings. Rather 
than arguing the practical aspects of a particular program, he would de­
scribe how it would affect them on the most primitive, down-to-e arth level. 
Do not believe that this approach works only with the illiterate and un­
schooled-it works on one and all. All of us are mortal and face the same 
dreadful fate, and all of us share the desire for attachm ent and belon ging. 
Stir up these emotions and you captivate our hearts. 
The best way to do this is with a dramatic jolt, of the kind that Chuko 
Liang created when he fed and released prisoners who expected only the 
worst from him. Shaking them to the core, he softened their hearts. Play on 
contrasts like this: Push people to despair, then give them relief. If they ex­
pect pain and you give them pleasure, you win their hearts. Creating plea­
sure of any kind, in fact, will usually bring you success, as will allaying fears 
and providing or promising secu rity. 
Symbolic gestures are often enough to win sympathy and goodwill. A 
gesture of self-sacr ifice, for example-a show that you suffer as those 
around you do-will make people identify with you, even if your suffering 
is symbolic or minor and theirs is real. When you enter a group, make a 
gesture of goodwill ; soften the group up for the harsher actions that will fol­
low later. 
When T. E. Lawr ence was fighting the Turks in the deserts of the Mid­
dIe East during Wo rld War I, he had an epiphany: It seemed to hirn that 
conventional warfare had lost its value. The old-f ashioned soldier was lost 
in the enormous armies of the time, in which he was ordered about like a 
lifeless pawn. Lawrence wanted to turn this around. For hirn, every sol­
dier's mind was a kingdom he had to conquer. A committed, psychologi­
cally motivated soldier would fight harder and more creatively than a 
puppet. 
Law rence's perception is still more true in the world today, where so 
many of us feel alienated, anonymous, and suspicious of authority, all of 
which makes overt power plays and force even more counterproductive 
and danger ous. Instead of manipulating lifeless pawns, make those on your 
side convinced and excited by the cause you have enlisted them in; this 
will not only make your work easier but it will also give you more leeway 
to deceive them later on. And to accomplish this you need to deal with 
their individual psycholog ies. Never clumsily assurne that the tactic that 
worked on one person will neces sarily work on another. To find the key 
that will motivate them, first get them to open up. The more they talk, the 
more they reveal about their likes and dislikes--the handles and levers to 
move them with. 
The quickest way to secure people's minds is by demon strating, as 
simply as possible, how an action will benefit them . Self-interest is the 
LAW 43 373 
374 LAW 43 strongest motive of all: A great cause may capture minds, but once the first 
flush of excitement is over, interest will flag-u nless there is something to 
be gained. Self-interest is the solider foundation. The causes that work best 
use a noble veneer to cover a blatant appeal to self-inter est; the cause se­
duces but the self -interest secures the deal. 
The people who are best at appealing to people's minds are often 
artists, intellectuals, and those of a more poetic nature. This is because 
ideas are most easily communicated through metaphors and imagery. It is 
always good policy, then, to have in your pocket at least one artist or intel­
lectual who can appeal concretely to people's minds. Kings have always 
kept a stable of writers in their bam: Frederick the Great had his Voltaire 
(until they quarreled and separated) , Napoleon won over Goethe. Con­
versely, Napoleon III's alienation ofwriters such as Victor Hugo, whom he 
exiled from France, contributed to his growing unpopula rity and eventual 
downfa ll. It is dangerous, then, to alienate those who have powers of ex­
pression, and useful to pacify and exploit them. 
Finally , leam to play the numbers game. The wider your support base 
the stronger your power. Understanding that one alienated, disaffected 
soul can spark a blaze of discontent, Louis XIV made sure to endear him­
self to the lowest members of his staff. You too must constantly win over 
more allies on allievels-a time will inevitably come when you will need 
them.

DISAR M AN D INFU RIATE 
WITH THE MIRROR EFF ECT 
JUDGMEN T 
The mirror rejlects reality, hut it is also the perfect tool for 
deception: lVhen you mirror your enemies, doing exactly 
as they do, they cannot figure out your strategy. The Mir­
ror Effect mocks and humiliates them, making them over­
react. By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce 
them with the illusion that you share their values; by 
holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a 
lesson. Few can resist the power of the Mirror Effect. 
MIR RO R EFFECTS: Preliminary Typology 
Mirrors have the power to disturb uso Gazing at our reflection in the mir­
ror, we most often see what we want to see-the image of ourselves with 
which we are most comforta ble. We tend not to look too closely, ignoring 
the wrinkles and blemishes. But if we do look hard at the reflected image, 
we sometimes feel that we are seeing ourselves as others see us, as a person 
among other people, an ob ject rather than a subject. That feeling makes us 
shudder-we see ourselves, but from the outside, minus the thoughts, 
spirit, and soul that fill our consciousne ss. We are a thing. 
In using Mirror Effects we symbolically re-create this disturbing power 
by mirroring the actions of other people, mimicking their movements to 
unsettle and infuriate them. Made to feel mocked, cloned, objectlike, an 
image without a soul, they get angry. Or do the same thing slightly differ­
ently and they might feel disarmed-you have perfectly reflected their 
wishes and desires. This is the narcissistic power of mirror s. In either case, 
the Mirror Effect unsettles your targets, whether angering or entrancing 
them, and in that instant you have the power to manipulate or seduce 
them. The Effect contains great power because it operates on the most 
primitiv e emotio ns. 
There are four main Mirror Effects in the realm of power: 
The Neutralizing Effect. In ancient Greek mythology, the Gorgon 
Medusa had serpents for hair, protruding tongue, massive teeth, and a face 
so ugly that anyone who gazed at her was turned into stone, out of fright. 
But the hero Perseus managed to slay Medusa by polishing his bronze 
shield into a mirror, then using the reflection in the mirror to guide hirn as 
he crept up and cut off her head without looking at her dire ctly. If the 
shield in this instance was a mirror, the mirror also was a kind of shield: 
Medusa could not see Perseus, she saw only her own reflected actio ns, and 
behind this screen the hero stole up and destroyed her. 
This is the essence of the Neutralizing Effect: Do what your enemies 
do, following their actions as best you can, and they cannot see what you 
are up to-they are blinded by your mirror. Their strategy for dealing with 
you depends on your reacting to them in a way characteristic of you; neu­
tralize it by playing a game of mimicry with them . The tactic has a mock­
ing, even infuriating effect. Most of us remember the childhood experience 
of someone teasing us by repeating our words exactly-after a while, usu­
ally not long, we wanted to punch them in the face. Wo rking more subtly 
as an adult, you can still unsettle your opponents this way; shielding your 
own strategy with the mirror, you lay invisible traps, or push your oppo­
nents into the trap they planned for you. 
This powerful technique has been used in military strategy since the 
days of Sun-tzu; in our own time it often appears in political campaigning. 
It is also useful for disguising those situa tions in which you have no particu­
lar strategy yourself. This is the Warrior' s Mirror. 
A reverse version of the Neutrali zing Effect is the Shadow: You TlIE MERC II,\r-,'1 ill\D 
HIS FHI E'ID 
A certain merchant 
once had a great desire 
to make a long journey. 
Now in regard that he 
was not very wealthy, 
"It is requisite. " said he 
to hirnself, "that before 
my departure I should 
leave some part ofmy 
estate in the city. to the 
end that if I meet with 
ililuck in my travel;� 
I may have wherewithal 
to keep me at my 
return" To this purpose 
he delivered a great 
number of bars of iron, 
which were a principal 
part of his wealth, in 
trust to one of his 
friends, desiring hirn to 
keep them during his 
absence; and then, 
ta king his leave, away 
he went. Some time 
after, having had but ill 
luck in his traveis, he 
returned horne; and the 
first thing he did was to 
go to his friend, and 
demand his iron: but 
his friend, who owed 
several sums of money, 
having sold the iron to 
pay his own debts, 
made hirn this ans wer,' 
"Truly, friend," said he, 
"I put your iron into a 
room that was close 
locked, imagining it 
would have been there 
as secure as my own 
gold; but an accident 
has happened which 
no one could have 
suspected, for there was 
a rat in the room which 
ate it all up." 
The merchant , 
pretending ignorance, 
replied, "It is a terrible 
misfortune to me 
indeed; but I know of 
LAW 44 377 
old that rats love iron 
extremely; I have 
suffered by them many 
tim es before in the same 
manner, amI therefore 
can the better bear my 
present ajfliction." 
This answer extremely 
pleased the friend, who 
was glad to hear the 
merchant so weil 
inclined to believe that 
a rat had eaten his iron; 
and to rem(JVe all 
suspicions, desired him 
to dine with him the 
next day. The merchant 
promised he would, but 
in the meantime he met 
in the middle ofthe city 
one of his friend's chU-
(Iren; the child he 
carried home, and 
locked up in a room. 
The next day he went to 
his friend, who seemed 
to be in greal ajfliction, 
which he asked him the 
cause 0[, as if he had 
been per fectly ignorant 
ofwhat had happened. 
"0, my dear friend," 
answered the other, "/ 
beg you 10 excuse me, if 
you do not see me so 
cheerful as otherwise 
I would be; I have lost 
one of my chi/dren; 
I have had him cried by 
sOl/nd of trumpet, but 
I know not what is 
become of him." 
"O!" replied the 
merchant, "/ am grieved

yesterday in the 
evening, as I parted 
from hence, I saw an 
owl in the air with a 
child in his claws; bI/I

I cannot lell." 
"Wh y, you mOSI foolish

replied the friend, "are

378 LAW 44 shadow your opponents' every move without their seeing you. Use the 
Shadow to gather information that will neutralize their strategy later on, 
when you will be able to thwart their every move. The Shadow is eff ective 
because to follow the movements of others is to gain valuab le insights into 
their habits and routi nes. The Shadow is the preeminent device for detec­
tives and spies. 
The Narcissus Effect. Gazing at an image in the waters of apond, the 
Greek youth Narcissus fell in love with it. And when he found out that the 
image was his own reflection, and that he therefore could not consummate 
his love, he despaired and drowned hirnself. All of us have a similar prob­
lem: We are profoundly in love with ourselves, but since this love excludes 
a love object outside ourselves, it remains continuously unsati sfied and un­
fulfilled. The Narcissus Effect plays on this universal narc issism: You look 
deep into the souls of other people; fathom their inmost desires, their val­
ues, their tastes, their spirit; and you reflect it back to them, making your­
self into a kind of mirror image. Your ability to reflect their psyche gives 
you great power over them; they may even feel a tinge oflove. 
This is simply the ability to mimic another person not physically, but 
psychologically, and it is immensely powerful because it plays upon the 
unsat isfied self-Iove of a child. Normall y, people bombard us with their ex­
periences, their tastes. They hardly ever make the effort to see things 
through our eyes. This is annoying, but it also creates great opportunity: If 
you can show you understand another person by reflecting their inmost 
feelings, they will be entra nced and disarmed, all the more so because it 
happens so rarely. No one can resist this feeling of being harmoniously re­
flected in the outside world, even though you might weH be manufacturing 
it for their benefit, and for deceptive purposes of your own. 
The Narcissus Effect works wonders in both social life and business; it 
gives us both the Seducer's and the Courti er's Mirror. 
The Moral Effect. The power of verbal argument is extremely limited, 
and often accomplishes the opposite of what is int ended. As Graciän re­
marks, "The truth is generally seen, rarely heard." The Moral Effect is a 
perfect way to demons trate your ideas through actio n. Quite simply, you 
teach others a lesson by giving them a taste of their own medici ne. 
In the Moral Effect, you mirror what other people have done to you, 
and do so in a way that makes them realize you are doing to them exactly 
what they did to you. You make them feeZ that their behavior has been un­
pleasant, as opposed to hearing you complain and whine about it, which 
only gets their defenses up. And as they feel the result of their actions rnir­
rored back at them, they realize in the profoundest sense how they hurt or 
punish others with their unsocial beha vior. You objectif y the quali ties you 
want them to feel ashamed of and create a mirror in which they can gaze at 
their follies and leam a lesson about themselve s. This technique is often 
used by educators, psychologists, and anyone who has to deal with un-
pleasant and unconscious behavior. This is the Teacher's Mirror. Whether 
or not there is actually anything wrong with the way people have treated 
you, however, it can often be to your advantage to reflect it back to them in 
a way that makes them feel guilty about it. 
The Hallucinatory Effect. Mirrors are tremendously deceptive, for they 
create a sense that you are looking at the real world. Actually, though, you 
are only staring at a piece of glass, which, as everyone knows, cannot show 
the world exactly as it is: Everything in a mirror is reversed. When Alice 
goes through the looking glass in Lewis Carroll 's book, she enters a world 
that is back-to-front, and more than just visually. 
The Hallucinatory Effe ct comes from creating a perfect copy of an ob­
ject, a place, aperson. This copy acts as a kind of dummy-p eople take it 
for the real thing, because it has the physical appearance of the real thing. 
This is the preeminent technique of con artists, who strategically mimic the 
real world to deceive you. It also has applications in any arena that re­
quir es camouflage . This is the Deceiver's Mirror. 
OBSER VA NCES OF MIR RO R EFFEC TS 
Observance I 
In February of 1815, the emperor Napoleon escaped from the island of 
Elba, where he had been imprisoned by the allied forces of Europe, and re­
turned to Paris in a march that stirred the French nation, rallying troops 
and citizens of all classes to his side and chasing his successor, King Louis 
XVI II, off the thro ne. By March, however, having reestablished hirnself in 
power, he had to face the fact that Fran ce's situation had gravely change d. 
The country was devastated, he had no allies among the other European 
nations, and his most loyal and important ministers had deserted hirn or 
left the country. Only one man remained from the old regime- Joseph 
Fouche, his former minister of police. 
Napoleon had relied on Fouche to do his dirty work throughout his 
previous reign, but he had never been able to figure his minister out. He 
kept a corps of agents to spy on all of his ministers, so that he would always 
have an edge on them, but no one had gotten anything on Fouche. If sus­
pected of some rnisdeed, the minister would not get angry or take the accu­
sation perso nally-he would submit, nod, srnile, and change colors 
charneleonlike, adapting to the requirements of the moment. At first this 
had seemed somewhat pleasant and charming, but after a while it frus­
trated Nap oleon, who feit outdone by this slippery man. At one time or an­
other he had fired all of his most important ministers, including Talleyrand, 
hut he never touched Fouche. And so, in 1815, back in power and in need 
of help, he feit he had no choice but to re appoint Fouche as his minister of 
polic e. 
Several weeks into his new reign, Napoleon's spies told him they be-most not above two or 
three pounds, can he 
carry a boy that weighs 
above fi fty? " 
"Why," replied the 
merchant, "do you 
make such a wonder at 
that? As if in a country 
where one rat can eat a 
hundred tons' weight 
o[ iron, it were such a 
wonder for an owl to 
carry a ehild that 
weighs not overfifty 
pounds in aW" The 
friend, upon this, found 
that the mercharll was 
no such fool as he took 
him to be, begged his 
pardon for the cheat 
whieh he designed to 
have put upon him, 
restored him the value 
of his iron, and so had 
his son again.

cluding Metternich of Austria. Mr aid that his most valuable minister was 
betraying hirn to his enemies, Nap oleon had to find out the truth before it 
was too late . He could not confront Fouche direct ly-in person the man 
was as slippery as an eel. He needed hard proof. 
This seemed to come in April, when the emperor's private police cap­
tured a Viennese gentleman who had come to Paris to pass information on 
to Fouc he. Ordering the man brought before hirn, Nap oleon threatened to 
shoot hirn then and there unless he conf essed; the man broke down and 
admitted he had given Fouche a letter from Metternich, written in invisible 
ink, arranging for a secret meeting of special agents in Basel. Nap oleon ac­
cordingly ordered one of his own agents to infiltrate this meeting. If Fouche 
was indeed planning to betray hirn, he would finally be caught red-handed 
and would hang. 
Nap oleon waited impatiently for the agent's return, but to bis bewil­
derment the agent showed up days later reporting that he had heard noth­
ing that would implicate Fouche in a conspi racy. In fact it seemed that the 
other agents present suspected Fouche of double-crossing thern, as if he 
were working for Napoleon all along. Napoleon did not believe this for an 
instant-F ouche had somehow outwitte d hirn again . 
The following morning Fouche visited Napoleon, and remarked, "By 
the way, sire, I never told you that I had a letter from Metternich a few 
days ago ; my mind was so full of things of greater moment. Besides, his 
emissary omitted to give me the powder needed to make the writing legi­
ble .... Here at length is the letter. " Sure that Fouche was toying with hirn, 
Napoleon exploded, "You are a traito r, Fouc he! I ought to have you 
hange d." He continued to harangue Fouche, but could not fire hirn without 
proof. Fouche only expressed amazement at the emperor's words, but in­
wardly he smiled, for all along he had been playing a mirroring gam e. 
Interpretation 
Fouche had known for years that Nap oleon kept on top of tho se around 
hirn by spying on them day and night. The minister had survived this game 
by having his own spies spy on Napoleon's spies, thus neutralizing any ac­
tion Napoleon might take aga inst hirn. In the case of the meeting in Basel, 
he even turned the tables: Knowing about Napoleon's double age nt, he set 
it up so that it would appear as if Fouche were a loyal double agent too. 
Fouche gained power and flour ished in ap eriod of great tumult by 
mirroring tho se around hirn. During the French Revolution he was a radi­
cal Jacobin ; after the Terror he became a moderate republican; and under 
Napoleon he became a committed imperialist whom Nap oleon ennobled 
and made the duke of Otranto . If Nap oleon took up the weapon of digging 
up dirt on people, Fouche made sure he had the dirt on Napoleon, as weIl 
as on everyone else. This also allowed hirn to predict the emperor' s plans 
and desires, so that he could echo his boss's sentiments before he had even 
uttered them. Shielding his actions with a mirror strategy, Fouche could 
also plot offensive moves without being caught in the act. 
This is the power of mirroring tho se around you. First, you give people 
the feeling that you share their thoughts and goals. Second, if they suspect 
you have ulterior motives, the mirror shields you from them, preventing 
them from figuring out your strategy. Eventually this will infuriate and un­
settle them. By playing the double, you steal their thunder, suck away their 
initiativ e, make them feel helpless. You also gain the ability to choose when 
and how to unsettle them-another avenue to power. And the mirror saves 
you mental energy: simply echoing the moves of others gives you the 
space you need to develop a strategy of your own. 
Observance 11 
Early on in his career, the ambitious statesman and general Alcibiades of 
Athens (450-404 B.C.) fashioned a formidable weapon that became the 
source of his power. In every encounter with others, he would sense their 
moods and tastes, then carefully tailor his words and actions to mirror their 
inmost desires. He would seduce them with the idea that their values were 
superior to everyone else's, and that his goal was to model hirnself on them 
or help them realize their dreams. Few could resist his charm. 
The first man to fall under his speIl was the philosopher Socrates. Al­
cibiades represented the opposite of the Socratic ideal of simplicity and up­
rightness: He lived lavishly and was completely unpri ncipled. Whenever 
he met Socrates, however, he mirrored the older man's sobriety, eating 
simply, accompanying Socrates on long walks, and talking only of philoso­
phy and virtue. Socrates was not completely fooled-he was not unaware 
of Alcibiades' other life. But that only made hirn vulnerable to a logic that 
flattered hirn: Only in my presence, he feIt, does this man submit to a virtu­
ous influence; only I have such power over hirn. This feeling intoxicated 
Socrate s, who became Alcibiades' fervent admirer and supporter, one day. 
even risking his own life to rescue the young man in battle. 
The Athenians considered Alcibiades their greatest orator, for he had 
an uncanny ability to tune in to his audience's aspirations, and mirror their 
desires. He made his greatest speeches in support of the invasion of Sicily, 
which he thought would bring great wealth to Athens and limitless glory to 
hirnself. The speeches gave expression to young Athenians' thirst to con­
quer lands for themselves, rather than living off the victories of their ances­
tors. But he also tailored his words to reflect older men's nostalgia for the 
glory years when Athens led the Greeks against Persia, and then went on to 
create an empire. All Athens now dreamed of conquering Sicily; Alcibi­
ades' plan was approved, and he was made the expedit ion's commander. 
While Alcibiades was leading the invasion of Sicily, however, certain 
Athenians fabricated charges against hirn of profaning sacred statues. He 
knew his enemies would have hirn executed if he retumed horne, so at the 
last minute he deserted the Athenian fleet and defected to Athens's bitter 
enemy, Sparta. The Spartans welcomed this great man to their side, but 
they knew his reputation and were wary of hirn. Alcibiades loved luxury; 
the Spartans were a warrior people who worshipped austerity, and they 
were afraid he would corrupt their youth. But much to their relief, the AI-heinfi the wronfi

CHRISTOPHER HIRBER T. 
1980 
382 LAW 44 cibiades who arrived in Sparta was not at all what they expected: He wore 
his hair untrimmed (as they did) , took cold baths, ate coarse bread and 
black broth, and wore simple clothes. To the Spartans this signified that he 
had come to see their way of life as superior to the Athenian ; greater than 
they were, he had chosen to be a Spartan rather than being born one, and 
should thus be honored above all others. They fell under his speIl and 
gave hirn great powers. Unfortunately Alcibiades rarely knew how to 
rein in his charm-he managed to seduce the king of Sparta's wife and 
make her pregnant. When this became public he once more had to flee 
for his life. 
This time Alcibiades defected to Persia, where he suddenly went from 
Spartan simplicity to embracing the lavish Persian lifestyle down to the last 
detail. It was of course immensely flattering to the Persians to see a Greek 
of Alcibiades' stature prefer their culture over his own, and they showered 
hirn with honors, land, and power. Once seduced by the mirror, they failed 
to notice that behind this shield Alcibiades was playing a double game, se­
cretly helping the Athenians in their war with Sparta and thus reingratiat­
ing hirnself with the city to which he desperately wanted to return, and 
which welcomed hirn back with open arms in 408 B.C. 
Interpretation 
Early in his political career, Alcibiades made a discovery that changed his 
whole approach to power: He had a colorful and forceful personality, but 
when he argued his ideas strongly with other people he would win over a 
few while at the same time alienating many more. The secret to gaining as­
cendancy over large numbers, he came to believe, was not to impose his 
colors but to absorb the colors of those around hirn, like a chameleon. 
Once people fell for the trick, the deceptions he went on to practice would 
be invisible to them. 
Understa nd: Everyone is wrapped up in their own narcissistic shell. 
When you try to impose your own ego on them, a wall goes up, resistance 
is increased. By mirroring them, however, you seduce them into a kind of 
narcissistic rapture: They are gazing at a double of their own soul. This 
double is actually manufactured in its entirety by you. Once you have used 
the mirror to seduce them, you have great power over them. 
It is worth noting, however, the dangers in the promiscuous use of the 
mirror. In Alcibiades' presence people feIt larger, as if their egos had been 
doubled. But once he left, they feIt empty and diminish ed, and when they 
saw hirn mirroring completely different people as totally as he had mir­
rored them, they feIt not just diminished but betrayed. Alcibiades' overuse 
of the Mirror Effect made whole peoples feel used, so that he constantly 
had to flee from one place to another. Indeed Alcibiades so angered the 
Spartans that they finally had hirn murdered. He had gone too far. The Se­
ducer's Mirror must be used with caution and discrimina tion. 
Observance 111 
In 1652 the recently widowed Baroness Mancini moved her family frorn 
Rome to Paris, where she could count on the influence and protection of 
her brother Cardinal Mazarin, the French prime minister. Of the 
baroness's five daug hters, four dazzled the court with their beauty and high 
spirits. These infam ously charming nieces of Cardinal Mazarin became 
known as the Mazarinette s, and soon found themselves invited to all the 
most important court functions . 
One daughter, Marie Mancini, did not share this good fortune, for she 
lacked the beauty and grace of her sisters-who, along with her mother 
and even Cardinal Mazarin, eventually came to dislike her, for they feit 
she spoiled the family image . They tried to persuade her to enter a con­
vent, where she would be less of an embarrassment, but she refused. In­
stead she applied herself to her studies, learning Latin and Greek, 
perfecting her French, and practicing her musical skills. On the rare occa­
sions when the family would let her attend court affairs, she trained herself 
to be an artful listen er, sizing people up for their weaknesses and hidden 
desires. And when she finally met the future King Louis XIV, in 1657 
(Louis was seventeen years old, Marie eighteen) , she decided that to spite 
her family and unde, she would find a way to make this young man fall in 
love with her. 
This was a seemingly impossible task for such a plain-Iooking girl, but 
Marie studied the future king dosely. She noticed that her sisters' frivolity 
did not please hirn, and she sensed that he loathed the scheming and petty 
politicking that went on all around hirn. She saw that he had a romantic na­
ture-he read adventure novels, insisted on marching at the head of his 
armies, and had high ideals and a passion for glory. The court did not feed 
these fanta sies of his; it was a banal, superficial world that bored hirn. 
The key to Louis 's heart, Marie saw, would be to construct a mirror re­
flecting his fantasies and his youthful yearnings for glory and roma nce. To 
begin with she immersed herself in the romantic novels, poems, and plays 
that she knew the young king read voraciously. When Louis began to en­
gage her in conversation, to his delight she would talk of the things that 
stirred his soul-not this fashion or that piece of gossip, but rather courtly 
love, the deeds of great knights, the nobility of past kings and heroes. She 
fed his thirst for glory by creating an image of an august, superior king 
whom he could aspire to become. She stirred his imaginati on. 
As the future Sun King spent more and more time in Marie 's presence, 
it eventually became dear that he had fallen in love with the least likely 
young woman of the court. To the horror of her sisters and mother, he 
showered Marie Mancini with attention. He brought her along on his mili­
tary campaigns, and made a show of stationing her where she could watch 
as he marched into battle . He even promised Marie that he would marry 
her and make her queen. 
Mazarin, however, would never allow the king to marry his niece, a 
woman who could bring France no diplomatie or royal alliances. Louis had 
to marry a princess of Spain or Austria. In 1658 Louis succumbed to the 
pressure and agreed to break off the first romantic involvement of his life. 
He did so with much regret, and at the end of his life he acknowl edged that 
he never loved anyone as much as Marie Mancini. Wittgenstein had an 
extraordinary gift for 
divining the thoughts 
of the person with 
whom he was engaged 
in discussion. Whi/e the 
other strugg/ed to put 
his thought into words, 
Wittgenstein wou/d 
perceive what it was 
and state it for him. 
This power ofhis,

ous researches.

Marie Mancini played the seducer's game to perf ection. First, she took a 
step back, to study her prey. Seduction often fails to get past the first step 
because it is too aggre ssive; the first move must always be a retreat. By 
studying the king from a distance Marie saw what distingui shed hirn from 
others-his high ideals, romantic nature, and snobbish disdain for petty 
politics. Marie's next step was to make a mirror for these hidden yearnings 
on Louis's part, letting hirn glimpse what he hirnself could be-a godlike 
king! 
This mirror had several functions: Satisfying Louis's ego by giving hirn 
a double to look at, it also focused on hirn so exdusively as to give him the 
feeling that Marie existed for hirn alone. Surro unded by a pack of schem­
ing courtiers who only had their own self-int erest at heart, he could not fall 
to be touched by this devotional focus. Finally Mar ie's mirror set up an 
ideal for hirn to live up to: the noble knight of the medieval court. To a soul 
both romantic and ambitious, nothing could be more intoxicating than to 
have someone hold up an idealized reflection of hirn. In effect it was Marie 
Mancini who created the image of the Sun King- indeed Louis later ad­
mitted the enormous part she had played in fash ioning his radiant self­
image. 
This is the power of the Seducer's Mirror: By doubling the tastes and 
ideals of the target, it shows your atte ntion to his or her psychology, an at­
tention more charming than any aggr essive pursuit. Find out what sets the 
other person apart, then hold up the mirror that will reflect it and bring it 
out of them. Feed their fantasi es of power and greatn ess by reflecting their 
ideals, and they will succu mb. 
Obser vance IV 
In 1538, with the dea th of his mother, Helena, the eight- year-old future 
czar Ivan IV (or Ivan the Terribl e) of Russia became an orphan. For the 
next five years he watched as the princely dass, the boyars, terroriz ed the 
country. Now and then, to mock the young Ivan, they would make him 
wear a crown and scepter and place hirn on the thro ne. When the little 
boy's feet dangl ed over the edge of the chair, they would laugh and lift him 
off it, handing hirn from man to man in the air, making hirn feel his help­
lessness compared to them . 
When Ivan was thirte en, he boldly murdered the boyar leader and as­
cended to the thro ne. For the next few decades he struggl ed to subdue the 
boyars' power, but they continued to defy hirn. By 1575 his efforts to trans­
form Russia and defeat its enemies had exhau sted hirn. Meanwhile, his 
subjects were comp laining bitterly about his endless wars, his secret police, 
the unvanqui shed and oppressive boyars. His own ministers began to ques­
tion his moves. Finally he had had enough. In 1564 he had tempo rarily 
aba ndoned the throne, forcing his subjects to call hirn back to power. Now 
he took the strategy a step further, and abdicate d. 
To take his place Ivan elevated a general of his, Simeon Bekbulatovich, 
to the throne. But although Simeon had recently converted to Christianity, 
he was by birth a Tartar, and his enthronement was an insult to Ivan's sub­
jects, since Russians looked down on the Tartars as inferiors and infidels. 
Yet Ivan ordered that all Russians, including the boyars, pledge obedience 
to their new ruler. And while Simeon moved into the Kremlin, Ivan lived 
in a humble house on Moscow's outskirts, from which he would sometimes 
visit the palace, bow before the throne, sit among the other boyars, and 
humbly petition Simeon for favors. 
Over time it became clear that Simeon was a kind ofking's double . He 
dressed like Ivan, and acted like Ivan, but he had no real power, since no 
one would really obey hirn. The boyars at the court who were old enough 
to remember taunting Ivan when he was a boy, by placing hirn on the 
throne, saw the connection: They had made Ivan feel like a weak pre­
tender, so now he mirrored them by placing a weak pretender of his own 
on the throne. 
For two long years Ivan held the mirror of Simeon up to the Russian 
people. The mirror said: Your whining and disobedience have made me a 
czar with no real power, so I will reflect back to you a czar with no real 
power. You have treated me disrespectfully, so I will do the same to you, 
making Russia the laughingstock of the world. In 1577, in the name of the 
Russian people, the chastised boyars once again begged Ivan to return to 
the throne, which he did. He lived as czar until his death, in 1584, and the 
eonspirac ies, complaining, and second-guessing disappeare d along with 
Simeon. 
Interpretation 
In 1564, after threatening to abdicate, Ivan had been granted absolute pow­
ers. But these powers had slowly been chipped away as every sector of so­
eiety-the boyars, the church, the government-vied for more control. 
Foreign wars had exhausted the country, internal bickering had increased, 
and Ivan's attempts to respond had been met with scorn. Russia had turned 
into a kind of boisterous classroom in which the pupils laughed openly at 
the teaeher. If he raised his voice or complained, he only met more resis­
tance. He had to te ach them a lesson, give them a taste of their own medi­
eine. Simeon Bekbulatovich was the mirror he used to do so. 
After two years in which the throne had been an object of ridicule and 
disgust, the Russian people leamed their lesson. They wanted their czar 
back, conceding to hirn all the dignity and respect that the position should 
always have commanded. For the rest of his reign, Russia and Ivan got 
along fine. 
Understand : People are locked in their own experiences. When you 
whine about some insensi tivity on their part, they may seem to understand, 
but inwardly they are untouched and even more resistant. The goal of 
power is always to lower people's resistance to you. For this you need 
tricks, and one trick is to teach them a lesson. 
Instead of haranguing people verbally, then, create a kind of mirror of 
their behavior. In doing so you leave them two choices: They can ignore 
LAW 44 385 
386 LAW 44 you, or they can start to think about thems elves. And even if they ignore 
you, you will have planted a seed in their unconscious that will eventually 
take root. When you mirror their behavior, incidentally, do not be afraid to 
add a touch of caricature and exaggerati on, as Ivan did by enthroning a 
Tartar-it is the little spiee in the soup that will open their eyes and make 
them see the ridiculousness in their own act ions. 
Observance V 
Dr. Milton H. Erickson, a pioneer in strategie psychotherapy, would often 
educate his patients powerfully but indirectly by creating a kind of mirror 
effect. Constructing an analogy to make patients see the truth on their own, 
he would bypass their resistance to change . When Dr. Erickson treated 
marri ed couples complaining of sexual problems, for insta nce, he often 
found that psychotherapy's tradition of direct confrontation and probIern­
airing only heightened the spouses' resistance and sharpened their differ­
ences. Instead, he would draw a husband and wife out on other topics, 
often banal ones, trying to find an analogy for the sexual confli ct. 
In one couple's first session, the pair were discussing their eating 
habits , especia lly at dinner. The wife preferred the leisurely approach-a 
drink before the meal, some appetizers, and then a small main course, all at 
a slow, civilized pace. This frustrated the husband -he wanted to get din­
ner over quickly and to dig right into the main course, the bigger the better. 
As the conversation contin ued, the couple began to catch glimp ses of an 
analogy to their problems in bed. The moment they made this connection, 
however, Dr. Erickson would change the subject, carefully avoiding a dis­
cussion of the real problem. 
The couple thought Erickson was just getting to know them and would 
deal with the problem directly the next time he saw them. But at the end of 
this first session, Dr. 'Erickson directed them to arrange a dinner a few 
nights away that would combine each person's desire: The wife would get 
the slow meal, including time spent bon ding, and the husband would get 
the big dishes he wanted to eat. Without realizing they were acting under 
the doctor's gentle guidance, the couple would walk into a mirror of their 
problem, and in the mirror they would solve their problems themselves, 
ending the evening just as the doctor had hoped-by mirroring the im­
proved dinner dyna mies in bed. 
In dealing with more severe problems, such as the schizophrenie's 
mirror fantasy world of his or her own construction, Dr. Erickson would al­
ways try to enter the mirror and work within it. He once treated a hos pital 
inmate who believed he was Jesus Christ-draping sheets around his 
body, talking in vague para bles, and bombarding staff and patients with 
endless Christian proselytizing. No therapy or drugs seemed to work, until 
one day Dr. Erickson went up to the young man and said, "I unde rstand 
you have had experience as a carpenter. " Being Christ, the patient had to 
say that he had had such experience, and Erickson immediately put hirn to 
work building bookcases and other useful items, allowing hirn to wear his 
Jesus garb. Over the next weeks, as the patient worked on these projects, 
his mind became less occupied with Jesus fantasies and more focused on 
his labor. As the carpentry work took precedence, a psychic shift took ef­
feet: The religio us fantasies remain ed, but faded comf ortably into the back­
ground, allowing the man to function in society. 
Interpretation 
Communication depends on metaphors and symbols, which are the basis 
of language itself. A metaphor is a kind of mirror to the concrete and real, 
which it often expre sses more clearly and deeply than a literal description 
does. When you are dealing with the intractable willpower of other people, 
direct communication often only heightens their resista nce. 
This happens most clearly when you complain about people's behav­
ior, particularly in sensitive areas such as their lovemaking. You will effect 
a far more lasting change if, like Dr. Erickson, you construct an analogy, a 
symb olic mirror of the situation, and guide the other through it. As Christ 
hirnself underst ood, talking in parables is often the best way to teach a les­
son, for it allows people to realize the truth on their OWll. 
When dealing with people who are lost in the reflections of fantasy 
worlds (including a host of people who do not live in mental hospital s), 
never try to push them into reality by shattering their mirrors. Instead, 
enter their world and operate inside it, under their rules, gently guiding 
them out of the hall of mirrors they have enter ed. 
Obs erva nce VI 
The great sixteenth-century Japanese tea master Tak eno Sho-o once 
passed by a house and noticed a young man watering flowers near his front 
gate. Two things caught Sho-o's attention-first, the graceful way the man 
performed his task; and, second, the stunningly beautiful rose of Sharon 
blossoms that bloomed in the gard en. He stopped and introduced hirnself 
to the man, whose name was Sen no Rikyu. Sho-o wanted to stay, but he 
had a prior engagement and had to hurry off. Before he left, however, 
Rikyu invited hirn to take tea with him the following morning. Sho-o hap­
pily accept ed. 
When Sho-o opened the garden gate the next day, he was horrified to 
see that not a single flower remained. More than anything else, he had 
come to see the rose of Sharon blossoms that he had not had the time to ap­
preciate the day befo re; now, disappointed, he started to leave, but at the 
gate he stopped hirnself , and decided to enter Sen no Rik yu's tea room. Im­
mediately insi de, he stopped in his tracks and gazed in astonishmen t: Be­
fore hirn a vase hung from the ceiling, and in the vase stood a single rose of 
Sharon blossom, the most beautiful in the gard en. Somehow Sen no Rikyu 
had read his guest' s thoug hts, and , with this one eloquent gesture, had 
demonstrated that this day guest and host would be in perfect harmony. 
Sen no Rikyu went on to become the most fam ous tea master of all, 
and his trademark was this uncanny ability to harmonize hirnself with his 
guests' thoughts and to think one step ahe ad, enchanting them by adapting 
to their taste. 
One day Rikyu was invited to tea by Yamashina Hechigwan, an ad-
LAW 44 387 
388 LAW 44 mirer of the tea ceremony but also a man with a vivid sense of humor. 
When Rikyu arrived at Hechigwan 's horne, he found the garden gate shut, 
so he opened it to look for the host. On the other side of the gate he saw 
that someone had first dug a ditch, then carefully covered it over with can­
vas and earth. Realizing that Hechigwan had planned a practical joke, he 
obligingly walked right into the ditch, muddying his clothes in the process. 
Apparently horrified, Hechigwan came running out, and hurried 
Rikyu to a bath that for some inexplicable reason stood already prepared. 
After bathing, Rikyu joined Hechigwan in the tea ceremony, which both 
enjoyed immensely, sharing a laugh about the accident. Later Sen no 
Rikyu explained to a friend that he had heard about Hechigwan 's practical 
joke beforehand, "But since it should always be one's aim to conform to 
the wishes of one's host, I fell into the hole knowingly and thus assured the 
success of the meeting. Tea is by no means mere obsequious ness, but there 
is no tea where the host and guest are not in harmony with one another. " 
Hechigwan 's vision of the dignified Sen no Rikyu at the bottom of a ditch 
had pleased him endlessly, but Rikyu had gained a pleasure of his own 
in complying with his host's wish and watching him amuse hirnself in 
this way. 
Interpretation 
Sen no Rikyu was no magician or seer-he watched those around hirn 
acutely, plumbing the subtle gestures that revealed a hidden desire, then 
producing that desire's image. Although Sho-o never spoke of being en­
chanted by the rose of Sharon blossoms, Rikyu read it in his eyes. If mir­
roring a person's desires meant falling into a ditch, so be it. Rikyu's power 
resided in his skillful use of the Cour tier's Mirror, which gave hirn the ap­
pearance of an unusual ability to see into other people. 
Learn to manipulate the Courtier's MirrOf, for it will bring you great 
power. Study people's eyes, follow their gestures-surer barometers of pain 
and pleasure than any spoken word. Notice and remember the details- the 
clothing, the choice of friends, the daily habits, the tossed-out remarks­
that reveal hidden and rarely indulged desires. Soak it all in, find out what 
lies under the surface, then make yourself the mirror of their unspoken 
selves. That is the key to this power: The other person has not asked for 
your consideration, has not mentioned his pleasure in the rose of Sharon, 
and when you reflect it back to hirn his pleasure is heightened because it is 
unasked for. Rememb er: The wordless communication, the indirect com­
pliment, contains the most power. No one can resist the enchantment of the 
Courtier's Mirror. 
Observance VII 
Yellow Kid Weil, con artist extraordinaire, used the Deceiver's Mirror in 
his most brilliant cons. Most audacious of all was his re-creation of a bank 
in Muncie, Indiana. When Weil read one day that the Merchants Bank in 
Muncie had moved, he saw an opportunity he could not pass up. 
Weil rented out the original Merchants building, which still contained 
bank furniture, complete with teller windows. He bought money bags, 
stenciled a bank's invented name on them, filled them with steel washers, 
and arrayed them impressively behind the teller windows, along with bun­
dIes of boodle-real bills hiding newspaper cut to size. For his bank's staff 
and customers Weil hired gambIers, bookies, girls from local bawdy 
houses, and other assorted confederates. He even had a local thug pose as a 
bank dick. 
Claiming to be the broker for a certificate investment the bank was of­
fering, Weil would fish the waters and hook the proper wealthy sucker. He 
would bring this man to the bank and ask to see the president. An "officer" 
of the bank would tell them that they had to wait, which only heightened 
the realism of the con-one always has to wait to see the bank president. 
And as they waited the bank would bustle with banklike activity, as call 
girls and bookies in disguise floated in and out, making deposits and with­
drawals and tipping their hats to the phony bank dick. Lulled by this per­
feet copy of reality, the sucker would deposit $50,000 into the fake bank 
without a worry in the world. 
Over the years Weil did the same thing with adeserted yacht club, an 
abandoned brokerage office, a relocated real estate office, and a com­
pletely realistic gambling club. 
Interpretation 
The mirroring of reality offers immense deceptive powers. The right uni­
form, the perfect accent, the proper props--the deception cannot be deci­
phered because it is enmeshed in a simulation of reality. People have an 
intense desire and need to believe, and their first instinct is to trust a well­
construeted facade, to mistake it for reality. After all, we cannot go around 
doubting the reality of everything we see-that would be too exhausting. 
We habitually accept appearances, and this is a credulity you can use. 
In this particular game it is the first moment that counts the most. If 
YOUf suckers' suspicions are not raised by their first glance at the mirror's 
reflection, they will stay suppressed. Once they enter your hall of mirrors, 
they will be unable to distinguish the real from the fake, and it will become 
easier and easier to deceive them. Remember: Study the world's surfaces 
and leam to mirror them in your habits, your manner, YOUf clothes. Like a 
camivorous plant, to unsuspecting insects you will look like all the other 
plants in the field.

Mirrors contain great power but also dangerous reefs, including the mir­

In 1864 the composer Richard Wagner moved to Munich at the behest 
of Ludwig 11, known variously as the Swan King or the Mad King of 
Bavaria. Ludwig was Wagner's biggest fan and most generous patron. The 
strength of his support tumed Wagner's head-once established in Munich 
under the king's protection, he would be able to say and do whatever he 
wanted. 
Wagner moved into a lavish house, which the king eventually bought 
for hirn. This house was but a stone's throw from the former horne of Lola 
Montez, the notorious courtesan who had plunged Ludwig lI's grandfather 
into a crisis that had forced hirn to abdicate . Wamed that he could be in­
fected by this association, Wagner only scoffed-"I am no Lola Montez," 
he said. So on enough, however, the citizens of Munich began to resent the 
favors and money showered on Wagner, and dubbed hirn "the second 
Lola," or "Lolotte ." He unconsciously began to tread in Lola's footsteps­
spending money extravagantly, meddling in matters beyond music, even 
dabbling in politics and advising the king on cabinet appoint ments. Mean­
while Ludwig's affection for Wagner seemed intense and undignified for a 
king-just like his grandfath er's love for Lola Montez. 
Eventually Ludwig' s ministers wrote bim a letter: "Y our Majesty now 
stands at a fateful parting of the ways: you have to choose between the love 
and respect of your faithful people and the 'friendship' of Richard Wag­
ner. " In December of 1865, Ludwig politely asked bis friend to leave and 
never return. Wagner had inadvertently placed himself in Lola Monte z's 
reflection. Once there, ever ything he did reminded the stolid Bavarians of 
that dread woman, and there was nothing he could do ab out it. 
Avoid such association- effects like the plague . In a mirro red situation 
you have little or no control over the reflections and recollections that will 
be connected to you, and any situation beyond your control is dange rous. 
Even if the person or event has positive associatio ns, you will suffe r from 
not being able to live up to them, since the past generally appears greater 
than the present. If you ever notice people associating you with some past 
event or person, do everything you can to sepa rate yourself from that 
memory and to shatter the reflection.

TRAN SGR ESSION OF THE LAW 
Sometime in the early 1520s, King Henry VIII of England decided to di­
vorce his wife , Catherine of Arago n, because she had failed to bear hirn a 
son, and because he had fallen in love with the young and comely Anne 
Boleyn. The pope, Clement VII, opposed the divorce, and threate ned the 
king with excommunica tion. The king's most powerful minister, Cardinal 
Wolsey, also saw no need for divorce--and his halfhearted support of the 
king cost hirn his position and soon his life. 
One man in Henry's cabinet, Thomas CromwelI, not only supported 
him in his desire for a divorce but had an idea for realizing it: a complete 
break with the past. He convin ced the king that by severing ties with Rome 
and making hirnself the head of a newly formed English church, he could 
divorce Catherine and marry Anne . By 1531 Henry saw this as the only so­
lutio n. To reward Cromwell for his simple but brilliant idea, he elevated 
this son of a blacksmith to the post of royal councillor. 
By 1534 Cromwell had been named the king's secretary, and as the 
power behind the throne he had become the most powerful man in Eng­
land. But for hirn the break with Rome went beyond' the satisf action of the 
king' s carnal desire s: He envisioned a new Protestant order in England, 
with the power of the Catholic Church smashed and its vast wealth in the 
hands of the king and the govemment. In that same year he initiated a 
complete survey of the church es and monasteries of England. And as it 
turned out, the treasures and moneys that the churches had accumulated 
over the centuries were far more than he had imagin ed; his spies and 
agents came back with astonishing figu res. 
To justify his schemes, Cromwell circulated stories about the corrup­
tion in the English monasterie s, their abuse of power, their exploitation of 
the people they supposedly served. Having won Parliament's support for 
breaking up the monasteries, he began to seize their holdings and to put 
them out of existence one by one. At the same time, he began to impose 
Protestantism, introducing reforms in religious ritual and punishing tho se 
who stuck to Cath olicism, and who now were called heretic s. Virtually 
overnight, England was converted to a new official relig ion. 
A terror fell on the country. Some people had suff ered under the 
Catholic Church, which before the reforms had been immensely powerful, 
but most Britons had strong ties to Catholi cism and to its comforting ritu­
als. They watched in horror as churches were demolished, images of the 
Madonna and saints were broken in pieces, stained-glass windows were 
smashed, and the churc hes' treasures were confiscate d. With monasteries 
that had succored the poor suddenly gone, the poor now flooded the 
streets. The growing ranks of the beggar dass were further swelled by for­
mer monks. On top of all this, CromwelI levied high taxes to pay for his ec­
clesiastical reforms. 
In 1535 powerful revolts in the North of England threatened to toppie 
Henry from his throne. By the following year he had suppressed the rebel­
Hons, but he had also begun to see the costs of Crom well's reforms. The 
king hirnself had never wanted to go this far-he had only wanted a di-WIIEHE CHH ISTMAS

lia, the festival of 
Saturn, god of the 
harvest, between 
December 17 and 23. It 
was the most cheerful 
festival of the year. All 
work and commer ce 
stopped, and the streets 
were filled with crowds 
and a carnival atmos­
phere. Slaves were 
temporarily freed, and 
the houses were deco­
rated with laurel 
branches. People 
visited one another, 
bringing gifts ofwax 
candles and little clay 
figurines. 
Long before the birth 
of Christ, the lews cele­
brated an eight-day 
Festival of Lights [at 
the same season}, and it 
is believed that the 
Germanie peoples held 
a great festival not only 
at midsummer but also 
at the winter solstice, 
when they celebrated 
the rebirth of the sun 
and honored the great 
fertility gods Wotan 
and Freyja, Donar 
(Thor) and Freyr. Even 
after the Emperor 
Constantine (A.D. 
306-337) declared 
Christianity to be 
Rome's official impe­
rial religion, the evoca­
tion of light and 
fertility as an important 
component of pre­
Christian midwinter 
celebrations could not 
be entirely suppressed. 
In the year 274 the 
Roman Emperor Aure­
lian (A.D. 214-275) had 
established an official 
LAW 45 393 
mit of the sun-god 
Mithras, declaring his 
birthday, December 25, 
anational holiday. The 
cult of Mithras, the 
A ryan god of light, had 
spread from Persia 
through Asia Minor (0 
Greece, Rome, and as 
far as the Germanie 
lands and Britain. 
Numerous ruins ofhis 
shrines still testify to 
the high regard in 
which this god was 
held, especially by the 
Roman legions, as a 
bringer of fertility, 
peace, and victory. 
So it was a clever move 
when, in the year A.D.

church under Pope 
Liberius (352-366) co­
opted the birthday of 
Mithras and declared 
December 25 to be

394 LAW 45 vorce. It was now Cromwe ll's turn to watch uneasily as the king began 
slowly to undo his reforms, reinstating Catholic sacraments and other ritu­
als that Cromwell had outlawed. 
Sensing his fall from grace, in 1540 Cromwell decided to regain 
Henry's favor with one throw of the dice: He would find the king a new 
wife. Henry' s third wife, lane Seymour, had died a few years before, and 
he had been pining for a new young queen. It was Cromwell who found 
hirn one: Anne of Cleves, a German princ ess and, most important to 
Cromwell, a Protestant. On Cromwe ll's commission, the painter Holbein 
produced a flattering portrait of Anne; when Henry saw it, he fell in love, 
and agreed to marry her. Cromwell seemed back in favor. 
Unfortunate ly, however, Holbein's painting was highly idealized, and 
when the king finally met the princess she did not please hirn in the least. 
His anger against Cromwell-first for the ill-conceived reforms, now for 
saddling hirn with an unattractiv e and Protestant wife-could no longer be 
contained. In lune of that year, Cromwell was arrested, charged as a Protes­
tant extremist and a heretic, and sent to the Tower. Six weeks later, before a 
large and enthusiastic crowd, the public executioner cut off his head. 
Interpretation 
Thomas Cromwell had a simple idea: He would break up the power and 
wealth of the Church and lay the foundation for Protestantism in England. 
And he would do this in a mercilessly short time. He knew his speedy re­
forms would cause pain and resentment, but he thought these feelings 
would fade in a few years. More important, by identifying hirns elf with 
change, he would become the leader of the new order, making the king de­
pendent on hirn. But there was a problem in his strategy : Like a billiard 
ball hit too hard against the cushion, his reforms had reactions and caroms 
he did not envision and could not control. 
The man who initiates strong reforms often becomes the scapegoat for 
any kind of dissatisfaction. And eventually the reaction to his reforms may 
consume hirn, for change is upsetting to the human animal, even when it is 
for the good. Because the world is and always has been full of insecurity 
and threat, we latch on to familiar faces and create habits and rituals to 
make the world more comfortable. Change can be pleasant and even 
sometimes desirable in the abstract, but too much of it creates an anxiety 
that will stir and boil beneath the surface and then eventually erupt. 
Never underestimate the hidden conservatism of those around you. It 
is powerful and entrenc hed. Never let the seductive charm of an idea cloud 
your reason: lust as you cannot make people see the world your way, you 
cannot wrench them into the future with painful changes. They will rebel. 
If reform is necessary, anticipate the re action against it and find ways to 
disguise the change and sweeten the poison. 
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 
As a young Communist in the 1920s, Mao Tse-tung underst ood better than 
any of his colleagues the incredible odds against a Communist victory in 
China. With their small numbers, limited funds, lack of military experi­
ence, and small arsenal of weapons, the Party had no hope of success un­
less it won over China's immense peasant population. But who in the 
world was more conservative, more rooted in tradition, than the Chinese 
peasantry? The oldest civilization on the planet had a history that would 
never loosen its power, no matter how violent the revolution. The ideas of 
Confucius remained as alive in the 1920s as they had been in the sixth cen­
tury B.C., when the philosopher was alive. Despite the oppressions of the 
current system, would the peasantry ever give up the deep-rooted values of 
the past for the great unknown of Commun ism? 
The solution, as Mao saw it, involved a simple deception: Cloak the 
revolution in the clothing of the past, making it comforting and legitimate 
in people's eyes. One of Mao's favorite books was the very popular me­
dieval Chinese novel The Water Margin, which recounts the exploits of a 
Chinese Robin Hood and his robber band as they struggle against a cor­
rupt and evil monarch . In China in Mao's time, family ties dominated over 
any other kind, for the Confucian hierarchy of father and oldest son re­
mained firmly in place; but The Water Margin preached a superior value­
the fraternal ties of the band of robbers, the nobility of the cause that unites 
people beyond blood. The novel had great emotional resonance for Chi­
nese people, who love to root for the underdog. Time and again, then, 
Mao would present his revolutionary army as an extension of the robber 
band in The Water Margin, likening his struggle to the timeless conflict be­
tween the oppressed peasantry and an evil emperor. He made the past 
seem to envelop and legitimize the Communist cause; the peasantry could 
feel comfortable with and even support a group with such roots in the past. 
Even on ce the Party came to power, Mao continued to associate it with 
the past. He presented himself to the masses not as a Chinese Lenin but as 
a modern Chuko Liang, the real-life third-century strategist who figures 
prominently in the popular historical novel The Romance 0/ the Three King­
doms. Liang was more than a great general-he was a poet, a philosoph er, 
and a figure of stern moral rectitude. So Mao represented himself as a poet­
warrior like Liang, a man who mixed strategy with philosophy and 
preached a new ethics. He made himself appear like a hero from the great 
Chinese tradition of warrior statesmen. 
Soon, everything in Mao's speeches and writings had a reference to an 
earlier period in Chinese history. He recalled, for example, the great Em­
peror Ch'in, who had unified the country in the third century B.C. Ch'in 
had burned the works of Confucius, consolidated and completed the build­
ing of the Great Wall, and given his name to China. Like Ch'in, Mao also 
had brought the country together, and had sought bold reforms against an 
oppressive past. Ch'in had traditionally been seen as a violent dictator 
whose reign was short; the brilliance of Mao's strategy was to turn this 
around, simultaneously reinterpreting Ch'in, justifying his rule in the eyes 
of present-day Chinese, and using him to justify the violence of the new 
order that Mao himself was creating. 
Mter the failed Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s, apower struggle 
LAW 45 395 
396 LAW 45 emerged in the Communist Party in which Mao's main foe was Lin Piao, 
once a elose friend of his. To make elear to the masses the difference be­
tween his philosophy and Lin's, Mao once again exploited the past: He 
cast his opponent as representing Confucius, a philosopher Lin in fact 
would constantly quote. And Confucius signified the conservatism of the 
past. Mao associated himse lf, on the other hand, with the ancient philo­
sophical movement known as Legalism, exemplified by the writings of 
Han-f ei-tzu. The Legalists disdained Confucian ethic s; they believed in the 
need for violence to create a new order . They worshiped power. To give 
hirnself weight in the strug gle, Mao unleashed a nationwide propa ganda 
campaign against Confucius, using the issues of Confucianism versus Le­
galism to whip the young into a kind of frenzied revolt against the older 
generat ion. This grand context enveloped a rather banal power struggle, 
and Mao once again won over the masses and triump hed over his enemies. 
Interpretation 
No people had a more profound attachment to the past than the Chinese. 
In the face of this enormous obstaele to reform, Mao's strategy was simple : 
Instead of struggling against the past, he turned it to his advantage, associ­
ating his radical Communists with the romantic figures of Chinese history. 
Weaving the story of the War of the Three Kingdoms into the struggle be­
tween the United State s, the Soviet Union, and China, he cast hirnself as 
Chuko Liang. As the emperors had, he welcomed the cultlike adoration of 
the masses, understanding that the Chinese could not function without 
some kind of father figure to adm ire. And after he made a terrible blunder 
with the Great Leap Forward, trying to force modernization on the country 
and failing miserably, he never repeated his mista ke: From then on, radical 
change had to be eloaked in the comf ortable elothes of the past. 
The lesson is simple: The past is powerful. What has happened before 
seems greate r; habit and history give any act weight. Use this to your ad­
vantage . When you destroy the familiar you create a void or vacuum ; peo­
pIe fear the chaos that will flood in to fill it. You must avoid stirring up such 
fe ars at all cost. Borrow the weight and legitimacy from the past, however 
remote, to create a comf orting and familiar presence. This will give your 
actions romantic associations, add to your presence, and eloak the nature 
of the changes you are attempting. 
It must be conside red that there is nothing more difficult to carry out, 
nor more doubt ful 0/ success, nor more dangerous to handle, 
than to initiate a new order 0/ things. 
Niccolo Machia velli, 1469-1527 
KEYS TO POWER 
Human psychology contains many dualiti es, one of them being that even 
while people understand the need for change, knowing how important it is 
for institutions and individuals to be occasiona lly renewed, they are also ir-
ritated and upset by changes that affect them personally. They know that 
change is neces sary, and that novelty provides relief from boredom, but 
deep inside they cling to the past. Change in the abstract, or superficial 
change, they desire, but a change that upsets core habits and routines is 
deeply disturbing to them. 
No revolution has gone without a powerftIl later reaction against it, for 
in the long run the void it creates proves too unsettling to the human ani­
mal, who unconsciously associates such voids with death and chao s. The 
oppor tunity for change and renewal seduces people to the side of the revo­
lution, but once their enthusiasm fades, which it will, they are left with a 
certain empti ness. Yearning for the past, they create an opening for it to 
creep back in. 
For Machia velli, the prophet who preaches and brings change can 
only survive by taking up arms: When the masses inevitably yearn for the 
past, he must be ready to use force. But the armed prophet cannot last long 
unless he quickly creates a new set of values and rituals to replace the old 
ones, and to soothe the anxieties of those who dread chan ge. It is far easier, 
and less bloody, to play akind of con game. Preach change as much as you 
like, and even enact your reforms, but give them the comforting appear­
ance of older events and traditi ons. 
Reigning from A.D. 8 to A.D. 23, the Chinese emperor Wang Mang 
emerged from aperiod of great historical turbulence in which the people 
yearned for order, an order represented for them by Confucius. Some two 
hundred years earlier, however, Emperor Ch'in had ordered the writings 
of Confucius burned. A few years later, word had spread that certain texts 
had miraculously surviv ed, hidden under the scholar's house. These texts 
may not have been genuin e, but they gave Wang his opportunity : He first 
confiscated them, then had his scribes insert passages into them that 
seemed to support the changes he had been imposing on the country. 
When he released the texts, it seemed that Confucius sanctioned Wang's 
reforms, and the people feIt comforted and accepted them more easily. 
Understand : The fact that the past is dead and buried gives you the 
freedom to reinterpret it. To support YOUT cause, tinker with the facts. The 
past is a text in which you can safely insert YOUT own lines. 
A simple ge sture like using an old title, or keeping the same number 
for a group, will tie you to the past and support you with the authority of 
history. As Machiavelli hirnself observed, the Romans used this device 
when they transf ormed their monarchy into a republic. They may have in­
stalled two consuls in place of the king, but since the king had been served 
by twelve lictors, they retain ed the same number to serve under the con­
suls. The king had personally perform ed an annual sacrifice, in a great 
spectacle that stirred the public; the republic retained this pract ice, only 
transferring it to a special "chief of the ceremony, whom they called the 
King of the sacri fice." These and similar ge stures satisfied the people and 
kept them from clamoring for the monarchy's return. 
Another strategy to disguise change is to make a loud and public dis­
play of support for the values of the past. Seem to be a zealot for tradition 
LAW 45 397 
398 LAW 45 and few will notice how unconventional you really are. Renaissance Flo­
rence had a centuries-old republic, and was suspicious of anyone who 
flouted its traditi ons. Cosimo de' Medici made a show of enthu siastic sup­
port for the republic, while in reality he worked to bring the city under the 
control of his wealthy family. In form, the Medicis retained the appearance 
of a republic; in substa nce, they rendered it powerless. They quietly en­
acted a radical change, while appearing to saf eguard tradi tion. 
Science claims a search for truth that would seem to protect it from 
conservatism and the irrationality of habit: It is a culture of innovation. Yet 
when Charles Darwin published his ideas of evolution, he faced fiercer op­
position from his fellow scientists than from religious authorit ies. His theo­
ries challenged too many fixed ideas. Jonas Salk ran into the same wall 
with his radical innovations in immunology, as did Max Planck with his 
revolutionizing of physics. Planck later wrote of the scientific opposition he 
faced, "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents 
and making them see the light, but rather beca use its opponents eventually 
die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it." 
The answer to this innate conservatism is to play the cOUftier's game. 
Galileo did this at the beginning of his scientific career; he later became 
more confrontational, and paid for it. So pay lip service to tradit ion. Iden­
tify the elements in YOUf revolution that can be made to seem to build on 
the past. Say the right things, make a show of conformity, and meanwhile 
let YOUf theories do their radical work. Play with appeara nces and respect 
past protocol. This is true in every arena -science being no exception. 
Finally, powerful people pay attention to the zeitg eist. If their reform is 
too far ahead of its time, few will understand it, and it will stir up anxiety 
and be hopelessly misinter preted. The changes you make must seem less 
innovative than they are. England did eventually become a Protestant na­
tion, as Cromwell wished, but it took over a century of gradual evolutio n. 
Watch the zeitgeist. If you work in a tumultuous time, there is power to 
be gained by preaching areturn to the past, to comfort, traditi on, and rit­
ual. During aperiod of stagna tion, on the other hand, play the card of re­
form and revolution -but beware of what you stir up. Those who finish a 
revolution are rarely those who start it. You will not succeed at this danger­
ous game unless you are willing to fore stall the inevitable re action again st it 
by playing with appeara nces and building on the past. 
Authority : He who desires or attempts to reform the government of a 
state, and wishes to have it accepted, must at least retain the semblance of 
the oid forms; so that it may seem to the people that there has been no 
change in the institut ions, even though in fact they are entirely different 
from the oid ones. For the great majority of mankind are satisfied with ap­
peara nces, as though they were realit ies. (Niccolö Machiavelli, 1469- 1527) 
REVERSAL Image: The Cat. 
Creature of habit, it loves the 
warmth of the familiar. Upset its 
routines, disrupt its space, and it will 
grow unmanageable and psychotic. 
Placate it by supporting its rituals. If 
change is necessary, deceive the cat by 
keeping the smell of the past alive; 
place objects familiar to it in 
strategie locations. 
The past is a corpse to be used as you see fit. If what happened in the re­
cent past was painful and harsh, it is self-destructive to associate yourself 
with it. When Napoleon came to power, the French Revolution was fresh 
in everyone's minds. If the court that he established had borne any resem­
blance to the lavish court of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, his courtiers 
would have spent all their time worrying about their own necks. Instead, 
Napoleon established a court remarkable for its sobriety and lack of osten­
tation. It was the court of a man who valued work and military virtues. This 
new form seemed appropriate and reassuring. 
In other words, pay attention to the times. But understand: If you 
make a bold change from the past, you must avoid at all costs the appear­
ance of a void or vacuum, or you will create terror. Even an ugly recent his­
tory will seem preferable to an empty space. Fill that space immediately 
with new rituals and forms. Soothing and growing familiar, these will seeure 
your position among the masses. 
Finally, the arts, fashion, and technology would seem to be areas in 
which power would come from creating a radical rupture with the past and 
appearing cutting edge. Indeed, such a strategy can bring great power, but 
it has many dangers. It is inevitable that your innovations will be outdone 
by someone else. You have little control-someone younger and fresher 
moves in a sudden new direction, making your bold innovation of yester­
day seem tiresome and tarne today. You are forever playing catch-up; your 
power is tenuous and short-lived. You want a power built on something 
more solid. Using the past, tinkering with tradition, playing with conven­
tion to subvert it will give your creations something more than a momen­
tary appeal. Periods of dizzying change disguise the fact that a yearning for 
the past will inevitably creep back in. In the end, using the past for your 
own purposes will bring you more power than trying to cut it out com­
pletely-a futile and self-destructive endeavor.

TRANSGR ESSION OF THE LAW 
Joe Orton met Kenneth Halliwell at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, 
London, in 1953, where both had enrolled as acting students . They so on 
became lovers and moved in together. Halliwell, twenty-five at the time, 
was seven years older than Orton, and seemed the more confident of the 
two; but neither had much talent as actors, and after graduating, having set­
tled down together in a dank London apartment, they decided to give up 
acting and collaborate as writers instead. Halliwell's inheritance was 
enough to keep them from having to find work for a few years, and in the 
beginning, he was also the driving force behind the stories and novels they 
wrote; he would dictate to Orton, who would type the manuscripts, occa­
sionally inteIjecting his own lines and ideas. Their first efforts attracted 
some interest from literary agents, but it sputtered. The promise they had 
shown was leading nowhere . 
Eventually the inheritance money ran out, and the pair had to look for 
work. Their collaborations were less enthusiastic and less frequent. The fu­
ture looked bleak. 
In 1957 Orton began to write on his own, but it wasn't until five years 
later, when the lovers were jailed for six months for defacing dozens of li­
brary books, that he began to find his voice (perhaps not by chance: This 
was the first time he and Halliwell had been separated in nine years). He 
came out of prison determined to express his contempt for English society 
in the form of theatrical farces. He and Halliwell moved back in together, 
but now the roles were reversed: Orton did the writing while Halliwell put 
in comments and ideas. 
In 1964 Joe Orton completed his first full-len gth play, EnteTtaining MT. 
Sloane. The play made it to London's West End, where it received brilliant 
reviews: A great new writer had emerged from nowhere . Now success fol­
lowed s lccess, at a dizzying pace. In 1966 Orton had a hit with his play 
Loot, and his popularity soared. Soon commissions came in from all sides, 
including from the Beatles, who paid Orton handsomely to write them a 
film script. 
Everything was pointing upwards, everything except Orton's relation­
ship with Kenneth Halliwell. The pair still lived together, but as Orton 
grew successful, Halliwell began to deteriora te. Watching his lover become 
the center of attention, he suffered the humiliation of becoming a kind of 
personal assistant to the playwright, his role in what had once been a col­
laboration growing smaller and smaller. In the 1950s he had supported 
Orton with his inheritanc e; now Orton supported hirn. At a party or 
among friends, people would naturally gravitate towards Orton-he was 
charming, and his mood was almost always buoyant. Unlike the handsome 
Orton, Halliwell was bald and awkward; his defensiveness made people 
want to avoid hirn. 
With Orton's success the couple's problems only worsened. Halliwell's 
moods made their life together impossibl e. Orton claimed to want to leave 
hirn, and had numerous affairs, but would always end up returning to his TIIE I'ARABU : 01" Tm:

even arranging for a gallery to show his work, but the show was a flop, and 
this only heightened Halliwell 's sense of inferiority. In May of 1967, the 
pair went on abrief holiday together in Tangier, Morocco. During the trip, 
Orton wrote in his diary, "We sat talking of how happy we feIt. And how it 
couldn't, surely, last. We'd have to pay for it. Or we'd be struck down from 
afar by disaster because we were, perhaps, too happy. To be young, good­
looking, healthy, famous, comparatively rich and happy is surely going 
against nature ." 
Halliwell outwardly seemed as happy as Orton. Inwardly, though, he 
was seething. And two months later, in the early moming of August 10, 
1967, just days after helping Orton put the finishing touch es to the wicked 
fa' ce What the Butler Saw (undoubtedly his masterpiece), Kenneth Halliwell 
bludgeoned Joe Orton to death with repeated blows of a h ammer to the 
head. He then took twenty-one sleeping pills and died hirnself , leaving be­
hind a note that read, "If you read Orton's diary all will be explained." 
Interpretation 
Kenneth Halliwell had tried to cast his deterioration as mental illness, but 
what Joe Orton's diaries revealed to hirn was the truth: It was envy, pure 
and simple, that lay at the heart of his sickness. The diaries, which Halli­
weIl read on the sly, recounted the couple's days as equals and their strug­
gle for recogniti on. After Orton found success, the diaries began to 
describe Halliw ell's brooding, his rude comments at parties, his growing 
sense of inferiority. All of this Orton narrated with a distance that bordered 
on contempt. 
The diaries made clear Halliw ell's bittemess over Orton's success. 
Eventually the only thing that would have satisfied hirn would have been 
for Orton to have a failure of his own, an unsuccessful play perhaps, so that 
they could have commiserated in their failure, as they had done years be­
fore. When the opposite happened-as Orton grew only more successful 
and popular-Halliwell did the only thing that would make them equals 
again: He made them equals in death. With Orton's murder, he became al­
most as famous as his friend-p osthumously. 
Joe Orton only partly underst ood his lover's deteriorat ion. His attempt 
to help Halliwell iaunch a career in art registered for what it was: charity 
and guilt. Orton basically had two possible solutions to the problem. He 
could have downplayed his own success, displaying some faults, deflecting 
Halliwell 's envy; or, once he realized the nature of the problem, he could 
have fled as if Halliwell were a viper, as in fact he was-a viper of envy. 
Once envy eats away at someone, everything you do only makes it grow, 
and day by day it festers inside hirn. Eventually he will attack. 
Only a minority can succeed at the game of life, and that minority in­
evitably arouses the envy of those around them. Once success happens 
your way, however, the people to fear the most are those in your own cir­
cle, the friends and acquaintances you have left behind. Feelings of inferi-
ority gnaw at them; the thought of your success only heightens their feel­
ings of stagnat ion. Envy, which the philosopher Kierkegaard calls "un­
happy admirat ion," takes hold. You may not see it but you will feel it 
someda y-unless, that is, you leam strategies of deflection, little sacrifices 
to the gods of success. Either dampen your brilliance occasionally, pur­
posefully revealing a defect, weakne ss, or anxiety, or attributing your suc­
cess to luck; or simply find yourself new frien ds. Never underesti mate the 
power of envy.

its prosper ity had created a republic that protected them from oppression 
by the nobility. Since high of fice could only be held for a few months, no 
one could gain lasting dominanc e, and although this meant that the politi­
cal factions struggl ed const antly for control, the system kept out tyrants 
and petty dictat ors. The Medici family lived for several centuries under this 
system without making much of a mark. They had modest origins as 
apothecari es, and were typical middle-dass citizens. Not until the late four­
teenth century, when Giovanni de' Medici made a modest fortune in bank­
ing, did they emerge as a force to be reckoned with. 
Upon Giovanni 's death, his son Cosimo took over the family business, 
and quickly demonstrated his talent for it. The business prospered under 
his control and the Medicis emerged as one of the preeminent banking 
families of Europ e. But they had a riyal in Flore nce: Despite the cit y's re­
publican system, one family, the Albizzis, had managed over the years to 
monopolize control of the govemment, forging alliances that allowed them 
to constantly fill important offices with their own men. Cosimo did not 
fight this, and in fact gave the Albizzis his tacit support. At the same time, 
while the Albizzis were beginning to flaunt their power, Cosimo made a 
point of staying in the background. 
Eventually, however, the Medici wealth could not be ig nored, and in 
1433, feeling threate ned by the family, the Albizzis used their govemment 
musde to have Cosimo arrested on charges of conspiring to overthrow the 
republic. Some in the Albizzi faction wanted Cosimo executed, others 
feared this would spark a civil war. In the end they exiled hirn from Flo­
rence. Cosimo did not fight the sentenc e; he left quietly. Sometimes, he 
knew, it is wiser to bide one's time and keep a low profile. 
Over the next year, the Albizzis began to stir up fears that they were 
setting up a dictat orship . Meanw hile, Cosimo, using his wealth to advan­
tage, continued to exert influe nce on Florentine affairs, even from exile. A 
civil war broke out in the city, and in September of 1434 the Albizzis were 
topp led from power and sent into exile. Cosimo immediately retumed to 
Florence, his position restore d. But he saw that he now faced a delicate sit­
uation: If he seemed amb itious, as the Albizzis had, he would stir up oppo­
sition and envy that would ultimately threaten his busine ss. If he stayed on she squinted horrihly; 
her teeth were disco 1-
ored and decayed, her 
poisonous breast of a 
greenish hue, and her 
tongue dripped venom. 
Only the sight of 
suffering could bring a 
smile to her fips. She 
never knew the comfort 
ofsleep, but was kept 
constantly awake hy 
care and anxiety, 
looked with dismay on 
men '.I' good fortune, 
and grew thin at the 
sight. Gnawing at 
others, and heing 
gnawed, she was herself 
her own torment. 
Minerva, in spite of her 
loathing, yet addressed 
her briejiy: "Instill your 
poison into one of 
Cecrop 's daughters­
her name is Aglauros. 
This is what I require 
of you." Without 
another word she 
pushed against the 
ground with her spear, 
left the earth, and 
soared upwards. 
From the corner of her 
eye the other watched 
the goddess out of 
sight, muttering and 
angry that Minerva 's 
plan should be success­
fu!. Then she took her 
staff, all encircled with 
thorny briars. wrapped 
herself in dark clouds, 
and set forth. Wherever 
she went she trampled 
down the jiowery fields, 
withered up the grass, 
seared the treeto"ps, and 
with her breath tainted 
the peoples, their cities 
and their homes, until 
at length she came to 
Athens, the horne of wit 
and wealth, peaceful 
and prosperous. She 
could scarcely refrain 
from weeping when she 
saw no cause for tears.

Then entering the 
chamber of Cecrop 's

out Minerva 's orders. 
She touched the girl 's

404 LAW 46 the sidelines, on the other hand, he would leave an opening for another 
faction to rise up as the Albizzis had, and to punish the Medicis for their 
success_ 
Cosimo solved the problem in two ways: He secretly used his wealth 
to buy influence among key citizens, and he placed his own allies, all dev­
erly enlisted from the middle dasses to disguise their allegiance to him, in 
top government positions. Those who complain ed of his growing political 
dout were taxed into submission, or their propert ies were bought out from 
under them by Cosimo's banker allies. The republic survived in name 
only. Cosimo held the strings. 
While he worked behind the scenes to gain control, however, publidy 
Cosimo presented another picture. When he walked through the streets of 
F1orence, he dressed modestly, was attended by no more than one ser­
vant, and bowed deferentially to magistrate s and eIder citizens. He rode a 
mule instead of a horse. He never spoke out on matters of public import, 
even though he controlled F1or ence's foreign affairs for over thirty years. 
He gave money to charities and maintain ed his ties to F1orence's merchant 
dass. He financed all kinds of public buildings that fed the F1orent ines' 
pride in their city. When he built a palace for hirnself and his family in 
nearby Fiesoie, he turned down the ornate designs that Brunelleschi 
had drawn up for hirn and instead chose a modest structure designed by 
Micheloz zo, a man of humble F10rentine origins. The palace was a symbol 
of Cosimo's strategy-all simplicity on the outside, all elegance and opu­
lence within. 
Cosimo finally died in 1464, after ruling for thirty years. The citizens 
of F10rence wanted to build hirn a great tomb, and to celebrate his memory 
with elaborate funeral ceremonies, but on his deathbed he had asked to be 
buried without "any pomp or demonstra tion." Some sixty years later, 
Machiavelli hailed Cosimo as the wisest of all princes, "for he knew how 
extraordinary things that are seen and appear every hour make men much 
more envied than those that are done in deed and are covered over with 
decency. " 
Interpretation 
A dose friend of Cosimo's, the bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci, once 
wrote of hirn, ''And whenever he wished to achieve something, he saw to it, 
in order to escape envy as much as possible, that the initiative appeared to 
come from others, and not from hirn." One of Cosimo 's favorite expres­
sions was, "Envy is a weed that should not be watere d." Understanding the 
power envy has in a democratic environment, Cosimo avoided the appear­
ance of greatness. This does not mean that greatne ss should be suffocated, 
or that only the mediocre should survive; only that agame of appearances 
must be played. The insidious envy of the masses can actually be deflected 
quite easily : Appear as one of them in style and values. Make alliances with 
those below you, and elevate them to positions of power to secure their 
support in times of need. Never flaunt your wealth, and carefully conceal 
the degree to which it has bought influence. Make a display of deferring to 
others, as if they were more powerful than you. Cosimo de' Medici per­
fected this game; he was a consummate con artist of appeara nces. No one 
could gauge the extent of his power-his modest exterior hid the truth. 
Never be so foolish as to believe that you are stirring up admiration by 
flaunting the qualities that raise you above others. By making others aware 
of their inferior position, you are only stirring up "unhappy admira tion," or 
envy, which will gnaw away at them until they undermine you in ways you 
cannot foresee. The fool dares the gods of envy by flaunting his victories. 
The master of power understands that the appearance of superiority over 
others is inconsequential next to the reality of it. 
Of alt the disor ders of the soul, envy is the only one no one confesses to. 
Plutarch, c. A.lJ. 46-120 
KEYS TO POWER 
The human animal has a hard time dealing with feelings of inferiority. In 
the face of superior skill, talent, or power, we are often disturb ed and ill at 
ease; this is because most of us have an inflated sense of ourselves, and 
when we meet people who surpass us they make it dear to us that we are in 
fact mediocre, or at least not as brilliant as we had thought. This distur­
bance in our self-image cannot last long without stirring up ugly emotions. 
At first we feel envy: If only we had the quality or skill of the superior per­
son, we would be happy. But envy brings us neither comfort nor any doser 
to equality. Nor can we admit to feeling it, for it is frowned upon socially­
to show envy is to admit to feeling inferior. To dose friends, we may con­
fess our secret unrealized desires, but we will never confess to feeling envy. 
So it goes underground. We disguise it in many ways, like finding grounds 
to criticize the person who makes us feel it: He may be smarter than I am, 
we say, but he has no morals or conscience. Or he may have more power, 
but that's because he cheats. If we do not slander hirn, perhaps we praise 
hirn excessi vely-another of envy's disguises. 
There are several strategies for dealing with the insidious, destructive 
emotion of envy. First, accept the fact that there will be people who will 
surpass you in some way, and also the fact that you may envy them. But 
make that feeling a way of pushing yourself to equal or surpass thern some­
day. Let envy turn inward and it poisons the soul; expel it outward and it 
can move you to greater heights. 
Second, understand that as you gain power, those below you will feel 
envious of you. They may not show it but it is inevita ble. Do not naively ac­
cept the facade they show you-read between the lines of their criticisms, 
their little sarcastic remarks, the signs of backstabbing, the excessive praise 
that is preparing you for a fall, the resentful look in the eye. Half the prob­
lem with envy comes when we do not recognize it until it is too late. 
Finally, expect that when people envy you they will work against you The envious hides as 
carefully lIS the secret, 
lustful sinner lind 
becomes Ihe endless 
inventor of tricks and 
strllillgems 10 hide and

is able to pretend to 
ignore the superiority 
of others which eats up 
his heart, as if he <lid 
not see them, nor hellr 
them, nor were aWllre 
of them, nor hat! ever

prevent lIny form of 
superiority from 
appearing in any situa­
tion. And if they do, he 
casts on them obscu­
rity, hypercriticism, 
sarcasm and calumny 
like Ihe load that spils 
poison from its hole. 
On the other hand he 
will raise endlessly 
insignijicant men, 
mediocre people, and 
even the inferior in the

406 LAW 46 insidiously. They will put obstacles in your path that you will not foresee, 
or that you cannot trace to their source. It is hard to defend yourself against 
this kind of attack. And by the time you realize that envy is at the root of a 
person's feelings about you, it is often too late: Your excuses, your false hu­
mility, your defensive actions, only exacerbate the problem. Since it is far 
easier to avoid creating envy in the first place than to get rid of it once it is 
there, you should strategize to forestall it before it grows . It is often your 
own actions that stir up envy, your own unawa reness. By becoming con­
scious of those actions and qualiti es that create envy, you can take the teeth 
out of it before it nibbles you to death . 
Kierkegaard believed that there are types of people who create envy, 
and are as guilty when it arises as those who feel it. The most obvious type 
we all know: The moment something good happens to them, whether by 
luck or design, they crow about it. In fact they get pleasure out of making 
people feel inferior. This type is obvious and beyond hope. There are oth­
ers, however, who stir up envy in more subtle and unconscious ways, and 
are partly to blame for their troubles. Envy is often a problem, for exam­
pIe, for people with great natural talent. 
Sir Walter Raleigh was one of the most brilliant men at the court of 
Queen Elizabeth of Engla nd. He had skills as a scientist, wrote poetry still 
recognized as among the most beautiful writing of the time, was a proven 
leader of men, an enterprising entrepreneur, a great sea captain, and on 
top of all this was a handsome, dashing courtier who charmed his way into 
becoming one of the queen's favorite s. Wherever he went, however, peo­
pIe blocked his path . Eventually he suffered a terrific fall from grace, lead­
ing even to prison and finally the executio ner's axe. 
Raleigh could not understand the stubbom opposition he faced from 
the other court iers. He did not see that he had not only made no attempt to 
disguise the degree of his skills and qualities, he had imposed them on one 
and all, making a show of his versatility, thinking it impressed people and 
won hirn friends. In fact it made hirn silent enemies, people who feIt infe­
rior to hirn and did all they could to ruin hirn the moment he tripped up or 
made the slightest mistake. In the end, the reason he was executed was 
treason, but envy will use any cover it finds to mask its destructivene ss. 
The envy elicited by Sir WaIter Raleigh is the worst kind: It was in­
spired by his natural talent and gra ce, which he feIt was best displayed in 
its full flower. Money others can attain; power as weIl. But superior intelli­
gence, good looks, charm-t hese are qualities no one can acquire. The nat­
urally perfeet have to work the most to disguise their brillia nce, displaying 
adefeet or two to deflect envy before it takes root. It is a common and 
naive mistake to think you are charming people with your natural talents 
when in fact they are coming to hate you. 
A great danger in the realm of power is the sudden improvement in for­
tune-an unexpected promotion, a victory or success that seems to come 
out of nowhere. This is sure to stir up envy among your former peers. 
When Archbishop de Retz was promoted to the rank of cardinal, in 
1651, he knew full weIl that many of his former colleagues envied hirn. 
Underst anding the foolishness of alienating those below hirn, de Retz did 
everything he could to downplay his merit and emphasize the role of luck 
in his success. To put people at ease, he acted humbly and deferentially, as if 
nothing had change d. (In reality, of course, he now had much more power 
than before.) He wrote that these wise policies "produced a good effect, by 
lessening the envy which was conceived again st me, which is the greatest of 
all secrets." Follow de Retz's example. Subtly emphasize how lucky you 
have been, to make your happiness seem more attain able to other people, 
and the need for envy less acute. But be careful not to affect a false modesty 
that people can easily see through. This will only make them more enviou s. 
The act has to be good; your humility, and your openness to those you have 
left behind, have to seem genui ne. Any hint of insincerity will only make 
your new status more oppressive . Rememb er: Despite your elevated posi­
tion, it will do you no good to alienate your former peers. Power requires a 
wide and solid support base, which envy can silently destroy. 
Political power of any kind creates envy, and one of the best ways to 
deflect it before it takes root is to seem unambi tious. When Ivan the Terri­
ble died, Boris Godunov knew he was the only one on the scene who could 
lead Russia. But if he sought the position eagerly, he would stir up envy 
and suspicion among the boyars, so he refused the crown, not once but 
several time s. He made people insist that he take the throne. George Wash­
ington used the same strategy to great effect, first in refusing to keep the po­
sition of Commander in Chief of the American army, second in resisting 
the presidency. In both cases he made hirnself more popular than ever. 
People cannot envy the power that they themselves have given a person 
who does not seem to desire it. 
According to the Elizabethan statesman and writer Sir Francis Bacon, 
the wisest policy of the powerful is to create a kind of pity for themselves, 
as if their responsibilities were a burden and a sacri fice. How can one envy 
a man who has taken on a heavy load for the public interest? Disguise your 
power as a kind of self-sacrifice rather than a source of happin ess and you 
make it seem less enviable. Emphasize your troubl es and you turn a poten­
tial danger (envy) into a source ofmoral support (pity) . A similar ploy is to 
hint that your good fortune will benefit those around you. To do this you 
may need to open your purse strings, like Cimon, a wealthy general in an­
cient Athens who gave lavishly in all kinds of ways to prevent people from 
resenting the influence he had bought in Athenian polit ics. He paid a high 
price to deflect their envy, but in the end it saved hirn from ostracism and 
banishment from the city. 
The painter J. M. W. Turner devised another way of giving to deflect 
the envy of his fellow artists, which he recognized as his greatest obstacle to 
his success. Noticing that his incomparable color skills made them afraid to 
hang their paintings next to his in exhibitio ns, he realiz ed that their fear 
would turn to envy, and would eventually make it harder for hirn to find 
galleries to show in. On occasion, then, Turner is known to have tempo rar­
ily damp ened the colors in his paintings with soot to earn hirn the goodwill 
of his colleag ues. one of his men to have 
them embarked. He 
himself returned to 
Rome. 
... The quantity of 
marbles was immense, 
so that, spread over the 
piazza, they were the 
admiration of all and a 
joy to the pope, who 
heaped immeasurable 
favors upon Michelan­
gelo; and when he 
began to work upon 
them again and again 
went to see him at his 
house, and talked to 
him about the tomb 
and other things as 
with his own brather. 
And in order that he 
might more easily go to 
him, the pope ordered 
that a drawbridge 
should be thrown 
across fram the Corri­
dore to the raoms of 
Michelangelo, by which 
he might visit him in 
private. 
These many and 
frequent favors were 
the cause (as often is 
the case at court) of 
much envy, and, after 
the envy, of endless 
persecution, since 
Braman te, the architect, 
who was loved hy the 
pope, made him change 
his mind as to the 
monument hy te/Ung 
him, as is said by the 
vulgar, that it is 
unlucky to build one's 
tomh in one's lifetime, 
and other tales. Fear as 
welt as envy stimulated 
Bramante, for the judg­
ment of Michelangelo 
had exposed many of 
his errars .... Now 
because he had no 
douht that Michelan­
gelo knew these errars 
of his, he always sought 
to remove him from 
Rome, or, at least, to 
deprive him of the 
LAW 46 407 
favor ofthe pope, and 
ofthe glory and useful­
ness that he might have 
acquired by his indus­
try. He sllcceeded in the 
matter of the 10mb. 
There is no doubt that 
if Michelangelo had 
been allowed to finish 
it, according to his first 
design, having so large 
a field in which to show 
his worth, no other 
artist, however cele­
brated (be it said with-
out envy) could have 
wrested from hirn the 
high place he would 
have held.

408 LAW 46 To deflect envy, Graciän recommends that the powerful display a 
weak ness, a minor social indiscretion, a harmless vice. Give those who 
envy you something to feed on, distracting them from your more impor­
tant sins. Remember: It is the reality that matters. You may have to play 
games with appearan ces, but in the end you will have what counts : true 
power. In some Arab countries, a man will avoid arousing envy by doing 
as Cosimo de Medici did by showing his wealth only on the inside of his 
house. Apply this wisdom to your own character. 
Beware of some of envy's disgu ises. Excessive praise is an almo st sure 
sign that the person praising you envies you; they are either setting you up 
for a fall-it will be impossible for you to live up to their pra ise-or they 
are sharpening their blades behind your back. At the same time, those who 
are hypercritical of you, or who slander you publicly, probably envy you 
as weIl. Recognize their behavior as disgu ised envy and you keep out of 
the trap of mutual mud-slinging, or of taking their criticisms to heart. Win 
your revenge by ignoring their measly presence. 
Do not try to help or do favors for those who envy you; they will think 
you are condesce nding to them. Joe Orton's attempt to help Halliwell find 
a gallery for his work only intensified his lover's feelings of inferiority and 
envy. Once envy reveals itself for what it is, the only solution is often to 
flee the presence of the enviers, leaving them to stew in a hell of their own 
crea tion. 
Finally, be aware that some environments are more conducive to envy 
than others. The eff ects of envy are more serious among colleagues and 
peers, where there is aveneer of equality. Envy is also destructive in demo­
cratic environments where overt displays of power are looked down upon. 
Be extrasensitive in such environment s. The filmmaker Ingmar Bergman 
was hounded by Swedish tax authorities because he stood out in a country 
where standing out from the crowd is frowned on. It is almost impossible 
to avoid envy in such cases, and there is little you can do but accept it gra­
ciously and take none of it persona lly. As Thoreau once said, "Envy is the 
tax which all distinction must pay. » 
Image : A Garden of We eds. You may not 
feed them but they spread as you water 
the garden. You may not see how, but 
they take over, taU and ugly, pre­
venting anything beautiful from 
flourishing. Before it is too late, 
do not water indis crimi-
nately. Destroy the weeds 
of envy by giving them 
nothing to feed on. 
Auth ority : Upon occasion, reveal a harmless defect in YOUf charac­
ter. For the envious accuse the most perfeet of sinning by having no 
sins. They become an Argus, all eyes for finding fault with excel­
lence-it is their only consolation. Do not let envy burst with its own 
venom -aff ect some lapse in valor or intellect, so as to dis arm it 
beforehand. You thus wave YOUf red cape before the Horns of Envy, 
in order to save YOUf immortality. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) 
REVERSAL 
The reason for being careful with the envious is that they are so indirect, 
and will find innumerable ways to undermine you. But treading carefully 
around them will often only make their envy worse. They sense that you 
are being cautious, and it registers as yet another sign of YOUf superio rity. 
That is why you must act before envy takes root. 
Once envy is there, however, whether through YOUf fault or not, it is 
sometimes best to affe ct the opposite appr oach: Display the utmost disdain 
for those who envy you. Instead of hiding YOUf perf ection, make it obvi­
ous. Make every new triumph an opportunity to make the envious squirm. 
YOUf good fortune and power become their living hell. If you .attain a posi­
tion of unimpeachable power, their envy will have no effect on you, and 
you will have the best revenge of all: They are tra pped in envy while you 
are free in YOUf power. 
This is how Michelangelo triumphed over the venomous architect 
Bramante, who turned Pope Julius against Michelange lo's design for his 
tomb . Bramante envied Michelan gelo's godlike skills, and to this one tri­
umph-the aborted tomb project -he thought to add another, by pushing 
the pope to commission Michelangelo to paint the mUfals in the Sistine 
Chapel. The pro ject would take years, during which Michelangelo would 
accomplish no more of his brilliant sculp tures. Furthermore, Bramante 
considered Michelangelo not nearly as skilled in painting as in sculpt ure. 
The chapel would spoil his image as the perf ect arti st. 
Michelangelo saw the trap and wanted to turn down the commission, 
but he could not refuse the pope, so he accepted it without complaint. 
Then, however, he used Bramant e's envy to SPuf hirn to greater heights, 
making the Sistine Chapel his most perfect work of all. Every time Bra­
mante heard of it or saw it, he feit more oppressed by his own envy-the 
sweetest and most lasting revenge you can exact on the enviou s. Know how to triumph 
over envy and malice. 
Here contempt, 
although prudent, 
counts, indeed, for 
little; magnanim ity is 
better. A good word 
concerning one who 
speaks evil of you 
cannot be praised too 
highly: there is no 
revenge more heroie 
than that broughl 
about by those merits 
and attainments wh ich 
frustrate and torment 
the envious. Every 
stroke of good fortune 
is a further twisl of the 
rope round the neck of

TRAN SGR ESSION OF THE LAW 
In 559 B.C., a young man named Cyrus gath ered an immense army from 
the scattered tribes of Persia and marched against his grandfa ther Astyages, 
king of the Medes. He def eated Astyages with ease, had himself crow ned 
king of Medea and Persia, and began to forge the Persian Empi re. Victory 
followed victory in quick succession . Cyrus defe ated Croesus, ruler of 
Lydia, then conquered the Ionian islands and other smaller kingdo ms; he 
marched on Babyion and crushed it. Now he was known as Cyrus the 
Great, King of the Wo rld. 
Mter capturing the riches of Babyion, Cyrus set his sights on the east, 
on the half -barbaric tribes of the Massagetai, a vast realm on the Caspian 
Sea. A fierce warrior race led by Queen Tomyris, the Massagetai lacked the 
riches of Babyion, but Cyrus decided to attack them anyway, believing 
himself superhuman and incapa ble of defeat. The Massagetai would fall 
easily to his vast armies, making his empire imme nse. 
In 529 B.C., then, Cyrus marched to the wide river Ara xes, gateway to 
the kingdom of the Massagetai. As he set up camp on the western bank, he 
received a message from Queen Tomyr is: "King of the Medes," she told 
hirn, "I advi se you to abandon this enterpr ise, for you cannot know if in the 
end it will do you any good. Rule yoUf own people, and try to bear the 
sight of me ruling mine . But of course you will refuse my advice, as the last 
thing you wish for is to live in peace." Tomyris, confident of her army's 
strength and not wishing to delay the inevitable battle, offered to withdraw 
the troops on her side of the river, allowing Cyrus to cross its waters safely 
and fight her army on the eastern side, if that was his desi re. 
Cyrus agreed, but instead of engaging the enemy directly he decided 
to play atrick. The Massa getai knew few luxuries. Once Cyrus had crossed 
the river and made his camp on the eastern side, he set the table for an 
elaborate banquet, full of meat, delicacies, and strong wine. Then he left 
his weakest troops in the camp and withdrew the rest of the army to the 
river. A large Massagetai detachment so on attacked the camp and killed all 
of the Persian soldiers in a fierce battle . Then, overwhelme d by the fabu­
lous feast that had been left behind, they ate and drank to their hearts' con­
tent. Later, inevitably, they fell asleep. The Persian army returned to the 
camp that night, killing many of the sleeping soldiers and capturing the 
rest. Among the prisoners was their general, a youth named Sparga pises, 
son of Queen Tomyris . 
When the queen learned what had happened, she sent a message to 
Cyrus, chi ding him for using tricks to defeat her army. "Now listen to me," 
she wrote, "and I will advise you for YOUf own good: Give me back my son 
and leave my country with YOUf forces intact, and be content with yoUf tri­
umph over a third part of the Massagetai. If you refuse, I swear by the sun 
our master to give you more blood than you can drink, for all your glut­
tony. " Cyrus scoff ed at her: He would not release her son. He would crush 
these barbar ians. 
The queen' s son, seeing he would not be released, could not stand the TIIE V\I\CU)HIOI ,

king dom, and whipping them into a vengeful frenzy, engaged Cyrus 's 
troops in a violent and bloody battle. Finally, the Massagetai preva iled. In 
their anger they decimated the Persian army, killing Cyrus himself. 
After the battle, Tomyris and her soldiers searched the battl efield for 
Cyrus's corpse. When she found it she cut off his head and shoved it into a 
wineskin full of human blood, crying out, "Though I have conquered you 
and live, yet you have ruined me by treacherously taking my son. See 
now-I fulfill my threat: You have your fill of blood." After Cyrus's death, 
the Persian Empire quickly unrave led. One act of arrogance undid all of 
Cyru s's good work. 
Interpretat ion 
There is nothing more intoxicating than victory, and nothing more dan­
gerous. 
Cyrus had built his great empire on the ruins of a previous one. A hun­
dred years earlier, the powerful Assyrian Empire had been totally de­
stroyed, its once splendid capital of Nineveh but ruins in the sand. The 
Assyrians had suff ered this fate because they had pushed too far, destroy­
ing one city-state after another until they lost sight of the purposes of their 
victor ies, and also of the costs. They overextended themselves and made 
many enemies who were finally able to band together and destroy them. 
Cyrus ignored the lesson of Assyria. He paid no heed to the warnings 
of oracles and advisers. He did not worry about offending a queen. His 
many victories had gone to his head, clouding his reason. Instead of con­
solidating his already vast empire, he pushed forward. Instead of recog niz­
ing each situation as different, he thought each new war would bring the 
same result as the one before as long as he used the methods he knew: 
ruthless force and cunning. 
Understand : In the re alm of power, you must be guided by reason. To 
let a momentary thrill or an emotional victory influence or guide yOUf 
moves will prove fatal. When you attain success, step back. Be cautious. 
When you gain victory, und erstand the part played by the particular cir­
cumstances of a situa tion, and never simply repeat the same actions again 
and again. History is littered with the ruins of victorious empires and the 
corpses of leaders who could not learn to stop and consolida te their gains. 
OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW 
No single person in history has occupied a more delicate and precarious 
position than the king's mistress. She had no real or legitimate power base 
to fall back on in times of trouble; she was sUITounded by packs of envious 
courtiers eagerly anticipating her fall from gra ce; and finally, since the 
source of her power was usually her physical beauty, for most royal mis­
tresses that fall was inevitable and unpleasant. 
King Louis XV of France began to keep official mistre sses in the early 
days of his reign, each woman's good fortune rarely lasting more than a 
few years. But then came Madame de Pompadour, who, when she was a 
middle-elass child of nine named Jeanne Poisson, had been told by a for­
tune-teller that she would someday be the king's favorite . This seemed an 
absurd dream, since the royal mistress almost always came from the aris­
tocracy. Jeanne nevertheless believed herself destined to seduce the king, 
and doing so became her obsession. She applied herself to the talents the 
king's favorite had to have-- music, dancing, acting, horseba ck riding­
and she excelled in every one of them. As a young woman, she married a 
man of the lower nobility, which gave her an entree to the best salons in 
Paris. Word quickly spread of her beauty, talent, charm, and intellig ence. 
Jeanne Poisson became elose friends with Voltaire, Montesquieu, and 
other great minds of the time, but she never lost sight of the goal she had 
set herself as a girl: to capture the heart of the king. Her husband had a 
chäteau in a forest where the king would often go hunting, and she began 
to spend a lot of time there. Studying his movements like a hawk, she 
would make sure he would "happen" to come upon her while she was out 
walking in her most alluring dress, or riding in her splendid coach. The 
king began to take note of her, making her gifts of the game he caught in 
the hunt. 
In 1744 Louis's current mistress, the Duchesse de Chäteauroux, died. 
Jeanne went on the offensi ve. She placed herself everywhere he would be: 
at masked balls at Versailles, at the opera, wherever their paths would 
cross, and wherever she could display her many talents: dancing, singing, 
riding, coque try. The king finally succumbed to her charms, and in a cere­
mony at Versaill es in September of 1745, this twenty-f our-year-old daugh­
ter of a midd le-elass banking agent was officially inaugurated as the king's 
mistre ss. She was given her own room in the palace, a room the king could 
enter at any time via a hidden stairway and back door. And because some 
of the courtiers were angry that he had chosen a woman of low origins, he 
made her a marqui se. From now on she would be known as Madame de 
Pompadour. 
The king was a man whom the slightest feeling of boredom would op­
press out of proportion. Madame de Pomp adour knew that keeping hirn 
under her spell meant keeping hirn amu sed. To that end she put on con­
stant theatrical productions at Versaill es, in which she starred. She orga­
nized elaborate hunting parties, masked balls, and whatever else it would 
take to keep hirn diverted outside the bedroom. She became a patron ess of 
the arts, and the arbiter of taste and fashion for all of France. Her enemies 
at the court only grew in number with each new success, but Madame de 
Pompadour thwarted them in a totally novel way for a king's mistre ss: with 
extreme polit eness. Snobs who resented her for her low birth she won over 
with charm and grace. Most unusual of all, she befriended the queen, and 
insisted that Louis XV pay more attention to his wife, and treat her more 
kindly. Even the royal family begrudgingly gave her their support. To nature of men is ambi­
lious as weil as suspi­
cious. and puts no 
limits to one's good 
fortune, it is not impos­
sible that the suspieion 
that may suddenly be 
aroused in the mind oI 
fhe prince by the 
victory of the general 
may have been aggra­
vated by some haughty 
expressions or insolent 
acts on his part; so that 
the prince will nallt­
rally be made to think 
ofsecuring himself 
against the ambition of 
his general. 
And to do this, the 
means that suggest 
themselves to him are 
either to have the 
general killcd. or to 
deprive him of that 
reputation which he 
has acquired wilh the 
prirlce's anny and the 
people, by using every 
means to prove that the 
genera/'s victory was 
not due to his skill allli 
courage, but to chance 
and the cowardice of 
the enemy, or to the 
sagacity of the other 
captains who were with 
him in that action.

414 LAW 47 crown her glory, the king made her a duc hess. Her sway was feIt even in 
politics: Indeed she beca me the untitl ed minister of foreign affai rs. 
In 1751, when Madame de Pompadour was at the height of her power, 
she exp erienced her worst crisis. Physically weak ened by the responsibili­
ties of her position, she found it increasingly difficuIt to meet the king's de­
mands in bed. This was usually the point at which the mistress would meet 
her end, strugg ling to maintain her position as her bea uty faded. But 
Madame de Pompadour had a strategy : She encouraged the king to set up 
a kind of brot hel, Parc aux Cerfs, on the grounds of Versai lles. There the 
middle -aged king could have liaisons with the most beautiful young girls in 
the realm. 
Madame de Pompa dour knew that her charm and her political acu­
men had made her indispensable to the king. What did she have to fear 
from a sixteen-yea r-old who had none of her power and presence? What 
did it matter if she lost her position in the bedroom, as long as she re­
mained the most powerful woman in France? To secure that position she 
became still closer friends with the queen, with whom she started attending 
church . Although her enemies at the court conspired to have her toppled 
from her official position as king's mist ress, the king kept her on, for he 
needed her calming effe ct. It was only when her part in the disastrous 
Seven Years' War drew much criticism on her that she slowly withdrew 
from public affa irs. 
Madame de Pomp adour's health had always been delicate, and she 
died at the age of forty -three, in 1764. Her reign as mistress had lasted an 
unprecedented twenty year s. "She was regretted by all," wrote the Duc de 
Croy, "for she was kindly and helpful to everyone who approach ed her." 
Interpretation 
Aware of the temporarin ess of her power, the king's mistress would often 
go into a kind of frenzy after capturing the king: She would try to accumu­
late as much money as possible to protect her after her inevitab le fall. And 
to extend her reign as long as possible, she would be ruthless with her ene­
mies in the court. Her situation, in other words, seemed to demand from 
her a greed and vindictiveness that would often be her undoing. Madame 
de Pompadour succeeded where all others had failed because she never 
pressed her good fortune. Instead of bullying the courtiers from her power­
ful position as the king' s mistress, she tried to win their support. She never 
revealed the slightest hint of greed or arroga nce. When she could no 
longer perform her physical duties as mistress, she did not fret at the 
thought of someone replacing her in bed. She simply applied some strat­
egy-she encouraged the king to take young lovers, knowing that the 
younger and prettier they were, the less of a threat they posed, since they 
could not compare to her in charm and sophistication and would so on 
bore the monarch . 
Success plays strange tricks on the mind. It makes you feel invulnera­
ble, while also making you more hostile and emotional when people chal -
lenge your power. It makes you less able to adapt to circumsta nce. You 
come to believe your character is more responsible for your success than 
your strategizing and planning. Like Madame de Pompadour, you need to 
realize that your moment of triumph is also a moment when you have to 
rely on cunning and strategy all the more, consolidating your power base, 
recognizing the role of luck and circumstance in your success, and remain­
ing vigilant against changes in your good fortune . It is the moment of vic­
tory when you need to play the courtier's game and pay more attention 
than ever to the laws of power. 
The g;reates t danger occurs at the moment 0/ victory. 
Napoleon Bona parte, 1769-18 21 
KEYS TO POWER 
Power has its own rhythms and patterns. Those who succeed at the game 
are the ones who control the patterns and vary them at will, keeping peo­
pIe off balance while they set the tem po. The essence of strategy is control­
ling what comes next, and the elation of victory can upset your ability to 
control what comes next in two ways. First, you owe your success to a pat­
tern that you are apt to try to repeat. You will try to keep moving in the 
same direction without stopping to see whether this is still the direction that 
is best for you. Second, success tends to go to your head and make you 
emotional. Feeling invulnera ble, you make aggressive moves that ulti­
mately undo the victory you have gain ed. 
The lesson is simple : The powernd vary their rhythms and patt erns, 
change course, adapt to circumstanc e, and leam to improv ise. Rather than 
letting their dancing feet impel them forward, they step back and look 
where they are going. It is as if their bloo dstream bore a kind of antidote to 
the intoxication of victory, letting them control their emotions and come to 
a kind of mental halt when they have attained success. They steady them­
selves, give themselves the space to reflect on what has happened, examine 
the role of circumstance and luck in their success. As they say in riding 
school, you have to be able to control yourself before you can control the 
horse. 
Luck and circumstance always play a role in power. This is inevita ble, 
and actually makes the game more interesting. But despite what you may 
think, good luck is more dangerous than bad luck. Bad luck teaches valu­
able lessons about pat ience, timing, and the need to be prepared for the 
worst; good luck deludes you into the opposite lesson, making you think 
your brillliance will carry you through. Your fortune will inevitably turn, 
and when it does you will be completely unprep ared. 
According to Machiavelli, this is what undid Cesare Borgia. He had 
many triumphs, was actually a clever strategist, but had the bad luck to 
have good luck : He had a pope for a father. Then, when he had bad luck 
for real-his father's death-he was unprepared for it, and the many ene-
LAW 47 415 
416 LAW 47 mies he had made devoured him. The good luck that elevates you or seals 
your success brings the moment for you to open your eyes: The wheel of 
fortune will hurtle you down as easily as up. If you prepare for the fall, it is 
less likely to ruin you when it happ ens. 
People who have a run of success can catch a kind of fever, and even 
when they themselves try to stay calm, the people below them often pres­
sure them to go past their mark and into dangero us wate rs. You have to 
have a strategy for dealing with these people. Simply pre aching modera­
tion will make you look weak and small-min ded; seeming to fail to follow 
up on a victory can lessen your power. 
When the Athenian general and statesman Pericles led aseries of 
naval campaigns around the Black Sea in 436 B.C., his easy triumphs en­
flamed the Athenians' desire for more. They dreamed of conquering 
Egypt, overrunning Persia, sailing for Sicily. On the one hand Peri cles 
reined in these dangerous emotions by warning of the perils of hubr is. On 
the other hand he fed them by fighting small battl es that he knew he could 
win, creating the appearance that he was preserving the momentum of suc­
cess. The skill with which Pericl es played this game is revealed by what 
happened when he died: The dema gogues took over, pushed Ath ens into 
invading Sicily, and in one rash move destroyed an empire. 
The rhythm of power often requires an alternation of force and cun­
ning. Too much force creates a counterreact ion; too much cunning, no 
matter how cunning it is, becomes predicta ble. Wo rking on behalf of his 
master, the shogun Oda Nobunaga, the great sixteenth-century Japanese 
general (and future emperor) Hideyoshi once engin eered a stunning vic­
tory over the army of the formida ble General Yoshimoto. The shogun 
wanted to go further, to take on and crush yet another powerful enemy, but 
Hideyoshi reminded him of the old Jap anese saying: "When you have 
won a victory, tighten the strings of your helmet." For Hideyoshi this was 
the moment for the shogun to switch from force to cunning and indirec­
tion, setting his enemies agai nst one another through aseries of deceptive 
alliances. In this way he would avoid stirring up needless opposition by 
appearing overly aggre ssive. When you are victorious, then, lie low, and 
lull the enemy into inaction. These changes of rhythm are immensely 
powerful. 
People who go past the mark are often motivated by adesire to please 
a master by proving their dedication. But an excess of effort exposes you to 
the risk of making the master suspicious of you. On several occasions, gen­
erals under Philip of Macedon were disgr aced and demoted immediately 
after leading their troops to a great victory; one more such victory, Philip 
thought, and the man might become a riyal instead of an underling. When 
you serve a master, it is often wise to measure your victories carefully, let­
ting him get the glory and never making him uneasy. It is also wise to es­
tablish a pattern of strict obedience to earn his trust. In the fourth cent ury 
B.C., a captain under the notoriously severe Chinese general Wu Ch'i 
charge d ahead before a battle had begun and came back with several 
enemy heads. He thought he had shown his fiery enthusiasm, but Wu Ch'i 
was unimpressed. "A talented officer," the general said with a sigh as he or­
dered the man beheaded, "but a disobedient one." 
Another moment when a small success can spoil the chances for a 
larger one may come if a master or superior grants you a favor: It is a dan­
gerous mistake to ask for more. You will seem insecure-perhaps you feel 
you did not deserve this favor, and have to grab as much as you can when 
you have the chanc e, which may not come again. The proper response is 
to accept the favor grac iously and withdra w. Any subsequent favors you 
should eam without having to ask for them. 
Finally, the moment when you stop has great dramatic import. What 
comes last sticks in the mind as a kind of exclamation point. There is no 
better time to stop and walk away than after a victory. Keep going and you 
risk lessening the effect, even ending up defea ted. As lawyers say of cross­
examinat ion, ''Always stop with a victory. "

Authority: Princes and republics should content themselves with victory, 
for when they aim at more, they generally lose. The use of insulting lan­
guage toward an enemy arises from the insolence of victory, or from the 
false hope of victory, which latter misleads men as often in their actions 
as in their words; for when this false hope takes possession of the mind, 
it makes men go beyond the mark, and causes them to sacrifice a cer­
tain good for an uncertain better. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1 527) 
LAW 47 417 
418 LAW 47 REVERSAL 
As Machiavelli says, either destroy a man or leave hirn alone entirely. In­
flicting half punishment or mild injury will only create an enemy whose 
hitterness will grow with time , and who will take revenge . When you heat 
an enemy, then, make your victory complete. Crush hirn into nonexis­
tence. In the moment of victory, you do not restrain yourself from crushing 
the enemy you have defeated, hut rather from needlessly advan cing 
aga inst others . Be merciless with your enemy, hut do not create new ene­
mies hy overreaching. 
There are some who hecome more cautious than ever after a victory, 
which they see as just giving them more possessions to worry ahout and 
protect. Your caution after victory should never make you hesitate, or lose 
momentum, hut rather act as a safeguard aga inst rash action. On the other 
hand, momentum as a phenomenon is greatly overrate d. You create your 
own successes, and if they follow one upon the other, it is your own doing. 
Belief in momentum will only make you emotional, less prone to act strate­
gically, and more apt to repeat the same methods. Leave momentum for 
those who have nothing hetter to rely upon.

Accept the fact that nothing is certain and no law is

420 LAW 48 TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW 
By the eighth century B.C., the city-states of Greece had grown so large and 
prosperous that they had run out of land to support their expanding popu­
lations. So they tumed to the sea, establishing colonies in Asia Minor, 
Sicily, the Italian peninsula, even Africa. The city-state of Sparta, however, 
was landlocked and surroun ded by mountain s. Lacking access to the 
Mediterranean, the Spartans never became a se afar ing people; instead 
they tumed on the cities around them, and, in aseries of brutal, violent 
conflicts lasting more than a hundred years, managed to conquer an im­
mense area that would provide enough land for their citizens. This solution 
to their problem, however, brought a new, more formidable one: How 
could they maintain and police their conquered territories ? The subordi­
nate peoples they ruled now outnumbered them ten to one. Surely this 
horde would take a horrible revenge on them. 
Sparta's solution was to create a society dedicated to the art of war. 
Spartans would be toug her, stronger, and fiercer than their neighb ors. This 
was the only way they could ensure their stability and survival. 
When a Spartan boy reached the age of seven, he was taken from his 
mother and placed in a military club where he was trained to fight and un­
derwent the strictest discipli ne. The boys slept on beds of reeds; they were 
allotted only one outer garm ent to wear for an entire year. They studied 
none of the arts; indeed, the Spartans banned music, and perrnitted only 
slaves to pract ice the crafts that were necessary to sustain them. The only 
skiIls the Spartans taught were those of warf are. Children seen as weaklings 
were left to die in a cavem in the mounta ins. No system of money or trad­
ing was allowed in Sparta; acquired wealth, they believed, would sow self­
ishness and dissension, weakening their warrlor disciplin e. The only way a 
Spartan could eam a living was through agriculture, mostly on state -owned 
lands, which slaves, called helots, would work for hirn. 
The Spartan s' sing le-mindedness allowed them to forge the most pow­
erful infantry in the world. They marched in perf ect order and fought with 
incomparable bravery. Their tight-knit phalanxes could vanquish an army 
ten times their size, as they proved in defeating the Persians at Thermopy­
lae. A Spartan column on the march would strike terror in the enemy; it 
seemed to have no weakn esses. Yet although the Spartans proved them­
selves mighty war riors , they had no interest in creating an empi re. They 
only wanted to keep what they had already conquered and to defend it 
against invaders . Decades would pass without a single change in the system 
that had succeeded so weIl in preserving Sparta's status quo. 
At the same time that the Spartans were evolving their warlike culture, 
another city-state was rising to equal promi nence: Athe ns. Unlike Sparta, 
Ath ens had taken to the sea, not so much to create colonies as for purposes 
of trade. The Ath enians became great merchants ; their currency, the fa­
mous "owl coins," spread throughout the Mediterran ean. Unlike the rigid 
Spartan s, the Ath enians responded to every problem with con summate 
creativity, adapting to the occasion and creating new social forms and new 
arts at an incredible pace. Their society was in constant flux. And as their 
power grew, they carne to pose a threat to the defen se-minded Spartan s. 
In 431 B.C., the war that had been brewing between Athens and Sparta 
for so long finally erupted. It lasted twenty -seven years, but after many 
twists of fortune, the Spartan war machine finally emerged victorious. The 
Spartans now commanded an empire, and this time they could not stay in 
their shell. If they gave up what they had gained, the beaten Athenians 
would regroup and rise against them, and the long war would have been 
fought for naught. 
After the war, Athenian money poured into Sparta. The Spartans had 
been trained in warf are, not politics or economics; beca use they were so 
unaccustomed to it, wealth and its accompanying ways of life seduced and 
overwhelmed them. Spartan govemors were sent to rule what had been 
Ath enian lands; far from horne, they succumbed to the worst forms of cor­
rupt ion. Sparta had defeated Ath ens, but the fluid Athenian way of life was 
slowly breaking down its discipline and loosening its rigid order. And 
Athens, meanwhile, was adapting to losing its empire, managing to thrive 
as a cultural and economic center. 
Confused by a change in its status quo, Sparta grew weaker and 
weaker. Some thirty years after defeating Athens, it lost an important batde 
with the city-state of Thebes. Almost ovemight, this once mighty nation 
collapsed, never to recover. 
Interpretation 
In the evolution of species, protective armor has almo st always spelled dis­
aster. Although there are a few exceptions, the shell most often becomes a 
dead end for the animal encased in it; it slows the creature down, making it 
hard for it to forage for food and making it a target for fast-moving preda­
tors. Animals that take to the sea or sky, and that move swifdy and unpre­
dictably, are infinitely more powerful and secure. 
In facing a serious problem -controlling superior numbers-Sparta 
reacted like an animal that develops a shell to protect itself from the envi­
ronment. But like a turde, the Spartans sacrificed mobility for safety. They 
managed to preserve stability for thr ee hundred years, but at what cost? 
They had no culture beyond warf are, no arts to relieve the tension, a con­
stant anxiety about the status quo. While their neighbors took to the sea, 
leaming to adapt to a world of constant motion, the Spartans entombed 
themselves in their own system. Victory would mean new lands to govem, 
which they did not want; defeat would mean the end of their military ma­
chine, which they did not want, either. Only stasis allowed them to surv ive. 
But nothing in the world can remain stable forever, and the shell or system 
you evolve for your protection will someday prove your undoing. 
In the case of Sparta, it was not the armies of Athens that defeated it, 
but the Athenian money. Money flows everywhere it has the opportunity 
to go; it cannot be controlled, or made to fit a prescrib ed patte rn. It is in­
herendy chaotic. And in the long run, money made Ath ens the conqueror, harharousl y cut "Hhis

OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW 
When World War 11 ended and the Japanese, who had invaded China 
in 1937, had finally been thrown out, the Chinese Nationalists, lead by 
Chiang Kai-shek, decided the time had come to annihilate the Chinese 
Communists, their hated rivals, once and for all. They had almost suc­
ceeded in 1935, forcing the Communists into the Long March, the grueling 
retreat that had greatly dirninished their numbers. Although the Commu­
nists had recovered somewhat during the war against Japan, it would not 
be difficult to defeat them now. They controlled only isolated areas in the 
countryside, had unsophisticated weaponry, lacked any military experi­
ence or training beyond mountain fighting, and controlled no important 
parts of China, except areas of Manchuria, which they had managed to take 
after the J apanese retreat. Chiang decided to commit his best forces in 
Manchuria. He would take over its major cities and from those bases would 
spread through this northern industrial region, sweeping the Communists 
away. Once Manchuria had fallen the Communists would collapse. 
In 1945 and '46 the plan worked perfect ly: The Nationalists easily 
took the major Manchurian cities. Puzzlingly, though, in the face of this 
critical campaign, the Communist strategy made no sense. When the Na­
tionalists began their push, the Communists dispersed to Manchuria's most 
out-of-the-way corners. Their small units harassed the Nationalist arrnies, 
ambushing them here, retreating unexpectedly there, but these dispersed 
units never linked up, making them hard to attack. They would seize a 
town only to give it up a few weeks later. Forming neither rear guards nor 
vanguards, they moved like mercury, never staying in one place, elusive 
and formless. 
The Nationalists ascribed this to two things: cowardice in the face 
of superior forces and inexperience in strategy. Mao Tse-tung, the Com­
munist leader, was more a poet and philosopher than a general, whereas 
Chiang had studied warf are in the West and was a folIower of the German 
military writer Carl von Clausewitz, among others. 
Yet a pattern did eventually emerge in Mao's attacks. After the Nation­
alists had taken the cities, leaving the Communists to occupy what was gen­
erally considered Manchuria's useless space, the Communists started using 
that large space to surround the cities. If Chiang sent an army from one city 
to reinforce another, the Communists would encircle the rescuing army. 
Chiang's forces were slowly broken into smaller and smaller units, isolated 
from one another, their lines of supply and communication cut. The Na­
tionalists still had superior firepower, but if they could not move, what 
good was it? 
A kind of terror overcame the Nationalist soldiers. Commanders com­
fortably remote from the front lines might laugh at Mao, but the soldiers 
had fought the Communists in the mounta ins, and had come to fear their 
elusiveness. Now these soldiers sat in their cities and watched as their fast­
moving enemies, as fluid as water, poured in on them from all sides. There 
seemed to be millions of them. The Communists also encircled the sol­
diers' spirits, bomba rding them with propaganda to lower their morale and 
pressure them to desert. 
The Nationalists began to surrender in their minds . Their encircled 
and isolated cities started collapsing even before being directly attacke d; 
one after another fell in quick succession. In November of 1948, the Na­
tionalists surrendered Manchuria to the Communists-a humiliating blow 
to the technically superior Nationalist army, and one that proved decisive 
in the war. By the following year the Communists controlled all of China. 
Interpretation 
The two board games that best approximate the strategies of war are chess 
and the Asian game of go. In chess the board is smalI. In comparison to go, 
the attack comes relatively quickly, forcing a decisive battle. It rarely pays 
to withdraw, or to sacrifice YOUf pieces, which must be concentrated at key 
areas. Go is much less formal. It is played on a large grid, with 361 inter­
sections-nearly six times as many positions as in chess. Black and white 
stones (one color for each side) are placed on the board's interseetions, one 
at a time, wherever you like. Once all YOUf stones (52 for each side) are on 
the board, the object is to isolate the stones of YOUf opponent by encircling 
them. 
Agame of go-called wei-chi in China-can last up to three hundred 
moves. The strategy is more subtle and fluid than chess, developing slowly; 
the more complex the pattern your stones initially create on the board, the 
harder it is for YOUf opponent to understand your strategy. Fighting to con­
trol a particular area is not worth the trouble: You have to think in larger 
terms, to be prepared to sacrifice an area in order eventually to dominate 
the board. What you are after is not an entrenched position but mobility. 
With mobility you can isolate the opponent in small areas and then encir­
cle them. The aim is not to kill off the opponent' s pieces directly, as in 
chess, but to induce a kind of paralysis and collapse. Chess is linear, posi­
tion oriented, and aggressive; go is nonlinear and fluid. Aggression is indi-Tm: I L\H [<: .\I\D

nent's stones at an accelerated pace. 
Chinese military strateg ists have been influe nced by go for centur ies. 
Its proverbs have been applied to war time and aga in; Mao Tse-tung was 
an addict of wei-chi, and its precepts were ingrained in his strate gies. A key 
wei-chi concept, for exa mple, is to use the size of the board to your advan­
tage, spreading out in every direction so that your opponent cannot fathom 
your movements in a simpl e linear way. 
"Every Chine se," Mao once wrote, "should consciously throw himself 
into this war of a jigsaw pattern" agai nst the Nationali sts. Place your men in 
a jigsaw pattern in go, and your opponent loses himself trying to figure out 
what you are up to. Either he wastes time pursuing you or, like Chiang Kai­
shek, he assumes you are incompetent and falls to protect himself. And if 
he concentrates on single areas, as Western strategy advises, he becomes a 
sitting duck for encirclement. In the wei-chi way of war, you encircle the 
enemy's brain, using mind games, propaganda, and irritation tactics to 
confuse and dishearten. This was the strategy of the Communists-an ap­
parent form lessness that disoriented and terrified their enemy. 
Where chess is linear and direct, the ancient game of go is closer to the 
kind of strategy that will prove relevant in a world where battles are fought 
indirectly, in vast, loosely connected areas. Its strategies are abstract and 
multidimensional, inhabiting ap lane beyond time and space: the strate­
gist's mind. In this fluid form of warf are, you value movement over posi­
tion. Your speed and mobility make it impossible to predict your moves; 
una ble to understand you, your enemy can form no strategy to defeat you. 
Instead of fixing on particular spots, this indirect form of warfare spreads 
out, just as you can use the large and disconnected nature of the real world 
to your advantage . Be like a vapor. Do not give your opponents anything 
solid to attack; watch as they exhaust themselves pursuing you, trying to 
cope with your elusiveness. Only formlessness allows you to truly surprise 
your enemies -by the time they figure out where you are and what you are 
up to, it is too late . 
When you want to fight us, we don 't let you and you can 't find uso But when 
we want to fight you, we make sure that you can 't get away and we hit you 
squarely , .. and wipe you out. , , . The enemy advanc es, we retreat; the enemy 
camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue. 
Mao Tse-tung, 189 3-1 976 
KEYS TO POWER 
The human animal is distingui shed by its constant creation of forms. 
Rarely expressing its emotions directly, it gives them form through lan­
guage , or through socially acceptable ritu als. We cannot communicate our 
emotions without a form. 
The forms that we create, however, change con stantly-in fashion, in 
style, in all those human phenomena representing the mood of the mo­
ment. We are constantly altering the forms we have inherited from previ­
ous generati ons, and these changes are signs of life and vitality. Indeed, the 
things that don 't change, the forms that rigidify, come to look to us like 
death, and we destroy them. The young show this most clearly: Uncom­
fortable with the forms that society imposes upon them, having no set iden­
tity, they play with their own characters, trying on a variety of masks and 
poses to express themselves. This is the vitality that drives the motor of 
form, creating constant changes in style. 
The powerful are often people who in their youth have shown im­
mense creativity in expressing something new through a new form. Society 
grants them power because it hungers for and rewards this sort of newness. 
The problem comes later, when they often grow conservative and posses­
sive. They no longer dream of creating new forms; their identities are set, 
their habits congeal, and their rigidity makes them easy targets. Everyone 
knows their next move. Instead of demanding respect they elicit boredom: 
Get off the stage! we say, let someone else, someone younger, entertain uso 
When locked in the past, the powerful look comical-they are overripe 
fruit, waiting to fall from the tree. 
Power can only thrive if it is flexible in its forms. To be formless is not 
to be amorphous; everything has a form-it is impossible to avoid. The 
formlessness of power is more like that of water, or mercury, taking the 
form of whatever is around it. Changing constantly, it is never predictab le. 
The powerful are constantly creating form, and their power comes from 
the rapidity with which they can change. Their formlessness is in the eye of 
the enemy who cannot see what they are up to and so has nothing solid to 
attack. This is the premier pose of power: ungraspable, as elusive and swift 
as the god Mercury, who could take any form he pleased and used this 
ability to wreak havoc on Mount Olympu s. 
Human creations evolve toward abstraction, toward being more men­
tal and less material. This evolution is clear in art, which, in this century, 
made the great discovery of abstraction and concept ualism; it can also be 
seen in politics, which over time have become less overtly violent, more 
complicated, indirect and cerebral. Warfare and strategy too have followed 
this pattern. Strategy began in the manipulation of armies on land, posi­
tioning them in ordered formations; on land, strategy is relatively two di­
mensional, and controlled by topography. But all the great powers have 
eventually taken to the sea, for commerce and colonization. And to protect 
their trading lanes they have had to leam how to fight at sea. Maritime war­
fare requires tremendous creativity and abstract thinking, since the lines 
are constantly shifting. Naval captains distinguish themselves by their abil­
ity to adapt to the literal fluidity of the terrain and to confuse the enemy 
with an abstract, hard-to-anticipate form. They are operating in a third di­
mension: the mind. 
Back on land, guerrilla warfare too demonstrates this evolution toward 
abstraction. T. E. Lawrence was perhaps the first modem strategist to de-CII\H.\( ''!'I'.11 \1l\JOH

LAW 48 425 
426 LAW 48 velop the theory behind this kind of warf are, and to put it into practice. His 
ideas influenced Mao, who found in his writings an uncanny Western 
equivalent to wei-chi. Lawrence was working with Arabs fighting for their 
territory against the Turks. His idea was to make the Arabs blend into the 
vast desert, never providing a target, never collecting together in one place. 
As the Turks scrambled to fight this vaporous army, they spread them­
selves thin, wasting energy in moving from place to place. They had the su­
perior firepower but the Arabs kept the initiative by playing cat and 
mouse, giving the Turks nothing to hold on to, destroying their morale. 
"Most wars were wars of contact. ... Ours should be a war of detac hment," 
Lawrence wrote . "We were to contain the enemy by the silent threat of a 
vast unknown desert, not disdosing ourselves till we attac ked." 
This is the ultimate form of strategy. The war of engagement has be­
come far too dangerous and costly ; indirection and elusiveness yield far 
better results at a much lower cost. The main cost, in fa ct, is mental-the 
thinking it takes to align your forces in scattered patt erns, and to under­
mine the minds and psychology of your opponents . And nothing will infu­
riate and disorient them more than formlessness. In a world where wars of 
detachment are the order of the day, form lessness is crucial. 
The first psychological requirement of form lessness is to train yourself 
to take nothing perso nally. Never show any defen siveness. When you act 
defensive, you show your emotions, revealing a dear form. Your oppo­
nents will realize they have hit a nerve, an Achilles' heel. And they will hit 
it again and again . So train yourself to take nothing person ally. Never let 
any one get your back up. Be like a slippery ball that cannot be held: Let no 
one know what gets to you, or where your weakne sses lie. Make your face 
a formless mask and you will infuriate and disorient your scheming col­
leagues and opponents. 
One man who used this technique was Baron J ames Rothschild. A 
German Jew in Paris, in a culture decidedly unfriendly to foreigners, Roth­
schild never took any attack on hirn personally or showed he had been 
hurt in any way. He furthermore adapted hirnself to the political dimate, 
whatever it was-the stiffly formal Restoration monarchy of Louis XVIII, 
the bourgeois reign of Louis- Phili ppe, the democratic revolution of 1848, 
the upstart Louis-Na poleon crowned emperor in 1852. Rothschild ac­
cepted them one and all, and blended in. He could afford to appear hypo­
critical or opportunistic because he was valued for his money, not his 
politics; his money was the currency of power. While he adapted and 
thrived, outwardly never showing a form, all the other great fam ilies that 
had begun the century immensely wealthy were ruin ed in the period's 
complicated shifts and turns of fortun e. Atta ching themselves to the past, 
they revealed their embrace of a form. 
Throughout history, the formless style of ruling has been most adeptly 
practiced by the queen who reigns alone. A queen is in a radically diff erent 
position from a king; because she is a woman, her subj ects and courtiers 
are likely to doubt her ability to rule, her strength of character. If she favors 
one side in some ideological struggle, she is said to be acting out of emo­
tional attachm ent. Yet if she represses her emotions and plays the authori­
tarian, in the male fashion, she arouses worse criticism still. Either by 
nature or by experience, then, queens tend to adopt a flexible style of gov­
erning that in the end often proves more powerful than the more direct, 
male form. 
Two female leaders exemplifying the formless style of rule are Queen 
Elizabeth of England and Empress Catherine the Great of Russia. In the vi­
olent wars between Catholics and Protestants, Elizabeth steered am iddIe 
course. She avoided allia nces that would commit her to one side, and that 
over time would harm the country. She managed to keep her country at 
peace until it was strong enough for war. Her reign was one of the most glo­
rious in his tory because of her incredible capacity to adapt and her flexible 
ideolog y. 
Catherine the Great too evolved an improvisatory style of governing. 
Mter she deposed her husband, Emperor Peter II, taking sole control of 
Russia in 1762, no one thought she would survi ve. But she had no precon­
ceived ideas, no philosophy or theory to dictate her policies. Although a 
foreigner (she came from Germa ny), she understood Russia's moods, and 
how it was changing over the years. "One must govern in such a way that 
one's people think they themselves want to do what one commands them 
to do," she said, and to do this she had to be always a step ahead of their 
desires and to adapt to their resista nce. By never forcing the issue, she re­
formed Russia in a strikingly short period of time . 
This feminin e, formless style of ruling may have emerged as a way of 
prospering under difficult circumsta nces, but it has proved immensely se­
ductive to those who have served under it. Being fluid, it is relatively easy 
for its subjects to obey, for they feel less coerced, less bent to their ruler's 
ideology. It also opens up options where an adherence to a doctrine closes 
them off. Without committing to one side, it allows the ruler to play one 
enemy off another. Rigid rulers may seem strong, but with time their in­
flexibility wears on the nerves, and their subjects find ways to push them 
from the sta ge. Flexib le, formless rulers will be much criticized, but they 
will endure, and people will event ually come to identify with them, since 
they are as their subj ects are-changing with the wind, open to circum­
stance. 
Despite upsets and delays, the permeable style of power generally tri­
umphs in the end, just as Athens eventually won victory over Sparta 
through its money and its culture. When you find yourself in conflict with 
someone stronger and more rigid, allow them a momentary victory. Seem 
to bow to their superio rity. Then, by being formless and adapta ble, slowly 
insinuate yourself into their soul. This way you will catch them off guard, 
for rigid people are always ready to ward off direct blows but are helpless 
aga inst the subtle and insinuating. To succeed at such a strategy you must 
play the cham eleo n-conform on the surfac e, while breaking down your 
enemy from the inside . 
LAW 48 427 
428 LAW 48 For centuries the Japanese would accept foreigners graciously, and ap­
peared susceptible to foreign cultures and influen ces. Joao Rodriguez, a 
Portuguese priest who arrived in Japan in 1577 and lived there far many 
years, wrote, "I am flabbergasted by the Japane se willingness to try and ac­
cept everything Portuguese." He saw Japanese in the streets wearing Por­
tuguese clothing, with rosary beads at their necks and crosses at their hips. 
This might seem like a weak, mutable culture, but Japan's adaptability 
actually protected the country from having an alien culture imposed by 
military invasion. It seduced the Portuguese and other Westemers into be­
lieving the Japanese were yielding to a superior culture when actually the 
foreign culture's ways were merely a fashion to be donned and doffed. 
Under the surface, Japanese culture thrived. Had the Japanese been rigid 
about foreign influences and tried to fight them off, they might have suf ­
fered the injuries that the West inflicted on China. That is the power of 
formlessness--it gives the aggressor nothing to react against, nothing to hit. 
In evolution, largeness is often the first step toward extinct ion. What is 
immense and bloated has no mobility, but must constantly feed itself. The 
unintelligent are often seduced into believing that size connotes power, the 
bigger the better. 
In 483 B.C., King Xerxes of Persia invaded Greece, believing he could 
conquer the country in one easy campaign . After all, he had the largest 
army ever assembled for one invasion-the historian Herodotus estimated 
it at over more than five million. The Persians planned to build a bridge 
across the Hellespont to overrun Greece from the land, while their equally 
immense navy would pin the Greek ships in harbor, preventing their 
forces from escaping to sea. The plan seemed sure, yet as Xerxes prepared 
the invasion, his adviser Artabanus wamed his master of grave misgivin gs: 
"The two mightiest powers in the world are against you," he said. Xerxes 
laughed-what powers could match his gigantic army? "I will tell you what 
they are," answered Artabanus. "The land and the sea." There were no safe 
harbors large enough to receive Xerxes' fleet. And the more land the Per­
sians conquered, and the longer their supply lines stretched, the more ru­
inous the cost of feeding this immense army would prove. 
Thinking his adviser a coward, Xerxes proceeded with the invasion. 
Yet as Artabanus predict ed, bad weather at sea decimated the Persian fleet, 
which was too large to take shelter in any harbor. On land, meanwhi le, the 
Persian army destroyed everything in its path, which only made it impossi­
ble to feed, since the destruction included crops and stores of food. It was 
also an easy and slow-moving target. The Greeks practiced all kinds of de­
ceptive maneuvers to disorient the Persians. Xerxes' eventual defeat at the 
hands of the Greek allies was an immense disaster. The story is emblematic 
of all those who sacrifice mobility for size: The flexible and fleet of foot will 
almost always win, for they have more strategie options. The more gigantic 
the enemy, the easier it is to induce collapse. 
The need for formlessness becomes greater the older we get, as we 
grow more likely to become set in our ways and assume too rigid a form. 
We become predicta ble, always the first sign of decrepitude. And pre­
dictability makes us appear comica1. Although ridicule and disdain might 
seem mild forms of attack, they are actually potent weapons, and will even­
tually erode a foundation of power. An enemy who does not respect you 
will grow bold, and boldness makes even the smallest animal danger ous. 
The late-eighteenth-century court of France, as exemplified by Marie­
Antoinette, had become so hopelessly tied to a rigid formality that the 
average Frenchman thought it a silly relic. This deprecia tion of a centuries­
old institution was the first sign of a terminal disease, for it represented a 
symbolic loosening of the people's ties to monarchy. As the situation wors­
ened, Marie-Antoinette and King Louis XVI grew only more rigid in their 
adherence to the past-and quickened their path to the guillotine. King 
Charles I of England reacted similarly to the tide of democratic change 
brewing in England in the 1630s: He disbanded Parliament, and his court 
rituals grew increasingly formal and distant. He wanted to return to an 
older style of ruling, with adherence to all kinds of petty protoco1. His 
rigidity only heighten ed the desire for change. So on, of course, he was 
swept up in a devastating civil war, and eventually he lost his head to the 
executio ner's axe. 
As you get older, you must rely even less on the past. Be vigilant lest 
the form your character has taken makes you seem a relic. It is not a matter 
of mimicking the fashions of youth-that is equally worthy of laughter. 
Rather your mind must constantly adapt to each circumsta nce, even the in­
evitable change that the time has come to move over and let those of 
younger age prepare for their ascendancy. Rigidity will only make you 
look uncannily like a cadaver. 
Never forget, though, that formlessness is a strategie pose. It gives you 
room to create tactical surprises; as your enemies struggle to guess your 
next move, they reveal their own strategy, putting them at a decided disad­
vantage. It keeps the initiative on your side, putting your enemies in the 
position of never acting, constantly reacting. It foils their spying and intelli­
gence. Remember: Formle ssness is a too1. Never confuse it with a go-with­
the-flow style, or with a religious resignation to the twists of fortune. You 
use formlessness, not because it creates inner harmony and peace, but be­
cause it will increase your power. 
Finally, learning to adapt to each new circumstance me ans seeing 
events through your own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that people 
constantly peddle your way. It means that ultimately you must throw out 
the laws that others preach, and the books they write to tell you what to do, 
and the sage advice of the eIder. "The laws that govern circum stances are 
abolished by new circumsta nces," Napoleon wrote, which means that it is 
up to you to gauge each new situation. Rely too much on other people's 
ideas and you end up taking a form not of your own making. Too much re­
spect for other people's wisdom will make you depreciate your own. Be 
brutal with the past, especially your own, and have no respect for the 
philosoph ies that are foisted on you from outside. 
LAW 48 429 
430 LAW 48 Image: Mercury. The winged messenger, 
god of commerce, patron saint of thieves, 
gambIers, and all those who deceive through 
swiftness. The day Mercury was born he invented 
the lyre; by that evening he had stolen the cattle of 
Apollo. He would scour the world, assuming 
whatever form he desired. Like the liquid metal 
named after him, he embodies the elusive, 
the ungraspable -the power of formlessness. 
Authority: Therefore the consummation of forming an army is to arrive 
at formlessness. Victory in war is not repetitious, but adapts its form 
endlessly .... A military force has no constant formation, water has no 
constant shape: The ability to gain victory by changing and adapting ac­
cording to the opponent is called genius. (Sun-tzu, fourth century B.C.) 
REVERSAL 
Using space to disperse and create an abstract pattern should not mean for­
saking the concentration of your power when it is valuable to you. Form­
lessness makes your enemies hunt all over for you, scattering their own 
forces, mental as weIl as physical. When you finally engage them, though, 
hit them with a powerful, concen trated blow. That is how Mao succeeded 
against the NationaHsts: He broke their forces into small, isolated units, 
which he then could easily overwhelm with a strong attack. The law of con­
centration prevail ed. 
When you play with formlessness, keep on top of the process, and 
keep your long-term strategy in mind. When you assume a form and go on 
the attack, use concentr ation, speed, and power. As Mao said, "fVhen we 
fight you, we make sure you can't get away."
