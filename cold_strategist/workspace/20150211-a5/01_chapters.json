      "chapter_text": "d that some other men and women have to take the risk of seeming presumptuous\nin offering those lessons.\nAnybody who does it need not be a genius. Genius has never been supposed to be a\nparticularly good teacher of any art. It is better that the teacher of the Art of Thinking should\nnot be a person who knows no difficulty in thinking, or produces such brilliant thoughts that\nthey will be disheartening to the tyro. A delicate physician does not give the example of health\n—any woodsman can do that—he only gives the example of a small capital of health\nintelligently increased: yet, we know he can be more useful from his comprehension of\nindifferent health and from his appreciation of hygiene, and we often prefer him. The author of\nthis book is certainly not prepared to say that he has acted, or even is now acting, up to his\nown principles; still he is not bragging in saying that he has probably felt their value more than\nmany people nearer to genius than he is. Is not this enough? And is not a keen desire to be of\nuse a sufficient claim to give modest advice?\nThe reader will soon find that this book, whatever its shortcomings, has been written for\nhim. Its effort at being lucid and brief, its aversion to philosophical jargon, its antipathy for a\ndiscouraging and generally useless bibliographical display, all come from a wish to help instead\nof dazzle. Most books are composed with the more or less avowed object of being works of art,\nthat is to say of being an end in themselves and ultimately rousing admiration. Egotism, in\nwriting of any art, especially of an Art of Thinking, would be criminal, and it can be honestly\nsaid it has had as little a share as possible in the preparation of this work.\nIt will be enough if the reader is conscious of sympathy to which he has a right, and of a\ncontinuous striving to help him in his effort to think his best and live his noblest.\nPart One\nON THINKING\n\n1. ON THINKING\nA familiar scene. Five o’clock late in October. The sunset over the reddening garden. You are\nstanding near the doorsill, looking, and not looking, thinking. Somebody steals by and you\nhear the words whispered “a penny for your thoughts.” What is your answer?\nLater in the day you are deep, or seem to be deep, in a book. But your face does not look as\nit usually does when you are happy in your reading: your contracted brow reveals intense\nconcentration, too intense for mere reading. In fact, you are miles away, and to the questions:\n“What are you thinking? What book is that?” you answer very much as you did when caught\nin that reverie, during the afternoon: “Oh! Thinking of nothing”; or, “Thinking of all sorts of\nthings.” Indeed, you were thinking of so many things that it was as if you had been thinking of\nnothing. Once more you were conscious of something experienced many times before: our mind\nis not like a brilliantly lit and perfectly ordered room; it is much more like an encumbered garret\ninhabited by moths born and grown up in half lights: our thoughts; the moment we open the\ndoor to see them better the drab little butterflies vanish.\nThe consciousness of this phenomenon is discouraging, of course. This accounts for the\nfact that, when offered a penny for our thoughts, we generally look, not only puzzled, but\nembarrassed, and anxious \nto be let alone not only by the questioner but by the question as\nwell. We are like the puppy who is willing to bark once at his own image in the mirror and to\nsnap eagerly behind it, but who, after the second trial, looks away in disgust. Yet, with some\ncuriosity and some practice, it is not impossible to have, at least, a peep at one’s mind. It should\nnot be attempted when we are too abstracted, that is to say, when our consciousness is\ncompletely off its guard but there are favorable occasions. When we are reading the newspaper\nand the quickly changing subjects begin to tire, without quite exhausting us; when the motion\nof the train or of the car sets our thoughts to a certain rhythm which may soon become\nabstraction or drowsiness, but still is only a slackening of the mental processes; when the\nlecture we hear is neither good enough to rivet our attention, nor bad enough to irritate us;\nthen, and every time we are in a mental lull, is our chance to get a glimpse of our mind as it\nreally works and as it reveals our innermost nature. By a sudden stiffening of our\nconsciousness, a quick face-about inwards, we can, as it were, solidify a section of mental\nstream which, during three or four seconds, will lie ready for our inspection. If one succeeds in\ndoing it once, one will certainly feel like doing it again, for no examination of conscience is so\nstrikingly illuminating as that one, and the more frequent it will be, the easier, at least during\ncertain periods, it will also become.\nWhy not do it now? A penny for your thoughts! What are you thinking of? . . .\nYou look up, surprised at what you regard as an exhibition of very poor taste in a writer.\n—“\nThinking? Why, I am thinking of your book. You may not be as interested in writing, as\nI am in reading it. I love this subject.\n”\n—“Yes, I saw you were remarkably attentive; that’s why I interrupted you. Had you been\nwandering, it would have been useless. So you love this subject?”\n—“\nI do indeed, and wish you would go on. Books should not talk.\n”\n—“When you say you love this subject, you mean it interests you, it excites something in\nyou; in short, it makes you think.”\n—“\nQuite.\n”\n—“Of course, these thoughts which occur to you as you read are your own, they are no\nmere reflections of what I am saying, and that is the chief reason for which you enjoy them as\nthey rise from behind my sentences. Is it not so?”\n—“\nVery likely, Sir. I begin to like this conversation.\n”\n—“Yes, it is about you; I knew you would like it. So, these thoughts which are your own\nand not mine are exterior to this book. Don’t you think they could be called a sort of\ndistraction?”\n—“\nIt would be rather unfair, Sir. I assure you I am following you closely; yet, I must admit\nthat I am not trying to memorize what you say: it would spoil all the pleasure I find in this. I\nam even willing to admit that my pleasure is my own and therefore might be called, as you say,\na sort of distraction. In fact, I was thinking . . .\n”\n—“Ah! here we are! You were thinking . . . ?”\n—“\nWell, I was thinking of a farm, up in Maine, where there used to be a garret like the one\nyou\n \nspoke of. In summer, when we were there, the smell of winter apples was still in it, and I\nloved it. I would sit there for hours, as a boy, thinking. You see, after all, I was thinking of\nthinking. As a matter of fact, often when I see the picture which gives me the deepest\nimpression of happy thinking—the portrait of E"

      "chapter_text": "rasmus writing—I think of the old garret. I\nhave no doubt that I thought of Erasmus, a few minutes ago, for I was positively annoyed, for\na moment, at the recollection of a man who once stood before that picture and asked me: who\nis this old fellow looking down his long nose? I hate a fool. The memory of this one actually\nmade me fidget in my chair, and I had to make an effort to think of something else.\n”\n—“You see that I was not far wrong; you have been thinking of a number of things which\nwere not in this book.”\n—“\nYes, but they came because of the book, and I should not be surprised if I were to think\nof your book, remember whole passages of it, I mean, to-morrow while doing important work\nat my office.\n”\n—“Thank you. Have you been thinking of that too?”\n—“\nWhy, it would be difficult not to. What I shall be signing to-morrow involves a sum I\nmight take five years to make. However, I am almost sure that everything will go well and I\ncan buy poor Jim the partnership he wants.\n”\n—“In the meantime here’s the penny I owe you. For I begin to know your thoughts pretty\nwell. Naturally they are, every one of them, about you, and that is as it should be. There are, of\ncourse, in your mind, thoughts hidden so deep that no amount \nof digging up could reveal them,\nbut there is no doubt that they would be even nearer your \nego\n than those you have discovered\nin the course of our conversation. Sometimes, very unexpectedly, we become aware of the\ntingling of our arteries in our heads, even of the fact that we are alive; this consciousness is of\nno use whatever to us, unless it somehow concurs in keeping us alive, but we are lavish when\nour Self is at stake. Do not imagine that I am reproaching you.”\n—“\nYou would be ungrateful, for let me repeat that I have seldom read anything so\nattentively as this book.\n”\n—“Certainly. Yet, you must also admit that while you were interested in this book you were\ninterested in something else. It is so with everybody. Have you ever heard that Sir Walter Scott,\nwhen he had found the nucleus of a new novel by which his imagination would naturally be\nengrossed, would, however, read volume after volume that had no reference to his subject,\nmerely because reading intensified the working of his brain? These books did for his power of\ninvention what the crowds in the city did for Dickens’s. When you say that you were reading\nthis book attentively, you mean that your intellect was expending some share of your\nconsciousness—let us say one fifth or, at best, one third of it—on the book. But your intellect\nis only a sort of superior clerk doing outside jobs for you. You, yourself, did not cease for all\nthat, doing the work of your Self, infinitely more important to you than any theory. What is\nimportant to you is the garret in which you used to muse away hours with the smell of apples\nfloating around you, the picture of Erasmus \nwhich you love, your undying indignation at the\nman who did not appreciate that picture, your son’s future and an exceptional chance of\nimproving it. All the time you were imagining that the \nArt of Thinking\n was making you think,\nyou were thinking of Jim, Erasmus, the fool, the garret and business, undoubtedly too, of\ndozens of other things we have not been able to trace back to your consciousness. Those\nthoughts, which you are tempted to call distractions, are what your Self is thinking, in \nspite\n of\nthe book, and, to tell the truth, the book is your distraction. Even writing can be the same thing.\n—Shall I tell you what my Self thinks while the superior clerk holds my pen? It thinks that I\nshould do my work with perfect happiness if, two hours ago, I had not seen a poor stray cat\nwandering in the drizzle with two frightened kittens at her side. I love cats as much as you hate\nfools.”\nI\nNTROSPECTION\n, as it is called, looking inwards, while the mind is active, will always disclose similar\nthings. Psychologists speak of the “mental stream,” and this expression alone has meant an\nimmense progress in the domain of interior observation as compared with the misleading\ndivision of the soul into separate faculties. In reality, the flux in our brain carries along images—\nremembered or modified—feelings, resolves, and intellectual, or partly intellectual conclusions,\nin vague or seething confusion. And this process never stops, not even in our sleep, any more\nthan a river ever stops in its course. But the mental stream is more like a mountain brook,\nconstantly hindered in its course, and whirling as often as it flows. When we look in we are\nconscious of the perpetual motion, but, if we do more than merely peep and at once look away,\nwe promptly notice the circular displacement and reappearance of whole psychological trains.\nThese trains are invariably produced by some image in whose wake they follow. The\ngentleman with whom I just had such an enlightening conversation had his mind full of a\nmultitude of images—inconsiderable reflections, as swift and also as broken and impossible to\narrest as the wavelets in a stream—but he was conscious, or semi-conscious of only a few.\nWhat were they? A room in a country-house, the picture of Erasmus by Holbein, a fool, Jim. To\nchange our simile—the more we use, the nearer we shall be to the endlessly changing reality—\nthese representations were like the larger and brighter fragments in a kaleidoscope. To these the\nmind of the gentleman would every few minutes revert.\nIt is hardly necessary to say that these images acted upon him as all images act upon us.\nWe are attracted by some and repelled by others. The old apple-room was altogether\nsatisfactory; so would Erasmus have been, had it not been for that silly man, and, in time, even\nthe silly man would have been tolerable because he produced not only irritation but a pleasant\nsense of superiority. As for Jim, it was delightful to see his not very good-looking face\ntransformed by joy as he heard his father begin: “Well, old man, it’s all right”; but it was the\nreverse to imagine him, a year from now, taking the same 8:17 train to do the same inferior work.\nProbably when the gentleman imagined he was smelling the shrivelled-up apples, happy Jim\nwas behind the door, but when the fool’s unforgettable six words \nwere heard in that satisfied\noily voice, Pelham station and the silent slaves streaming in with poor Jim were not far. I say\nprobably, for who knows? Quite possibly, relief from an unpleasant picture was sought in a\npleasanter one. The stream runs fast and so deep between its brambly sides that it is impossible\nto see anything clearly in it.\nAll we can say is: 1. That most of our mental operations are inseparable from images, or are\nproduced by images. We do not differ in this from the dear animals near us. (If anybody does\nnot realise that a dog’s brain registers an encyclopedia of images, sounds and odors as large as\na dictionary and far better remembered, the dog’s behavior will be entirely unintelligible.) 2.\nThat those images closely correspond to wishes or repulsions, to things we want or do not\nwant, so that this wanting or not wanting seems to be the ultimate motive power in our\npsychology, probably in connection with elementary conditions in our being. 3. That inevitably,\npeople will reveal in their thoughts and speeches, in their outlook on life and in their lives\nthemselves, the quality of the images filling their minds. Investigation and estimation of these\nimages, together with investigation and estimation of our likes and dislikes, will tell us what we\nare worth morally more accurately than even our actions, for they are the roots of action. But to\nthis we shall revert later.\nS\nURELY\n, you say, what you have described so far is not thought. Our brain must be free\nsometimes from images, from likes or dislikes, from wants and repulsions. There must be a\nsuperior kind of mental operation, something immaterial resulting in abstractions. \nHow are\nmathematical and philosophical systems evolved?

      "chapter_text": "tends to abstraction. But the study of it belongs to the\nScience of Thought, while we are here concerned only with the Art of Thinking. Yet, it is useful,\neven for our purpose, to say a word about this less practical aspect of the subject.\nWe have an idea that thought—as diamonds are wrongly supposed to do—can exist in a\npure state, and is elaborated without images. We feel sure that we are not infrequently\nconscious of conclusions, practical or speculative, arrived at without the help of images. What\nare those?\nAh! What are they? But, first of all, are there any? How can we be sure that there are any?\nEvery time we really succeed in watching our mental process we discover the presence of\nimages. You say “thoughts,” “pure thought,” and you are persuaded that you say this without\nany accompanying image, but are you right or wrong? While you say “thought,” is it, or is it\nnot possible that you see a man’s head, or his brow, or the inside of his head visualized, not as\na horrible brain jelly, but perhaps as a more or less complicated wire frame destined \nto classify\nand keep in place the results arrived at, or as an infinitely delicate clockwork?\nThe names of mental operations which are now abstract were not so originally. To \nsee\n and\nto \nknow\n are the same word in Greek; to \nponder\n, which sounds so intellectual, obviously means\nto weigh; to \nthink\n is the ghostlike descendant of a much rougher word meaning to \nseem\n; \nlogic\nand \nspeech\n are the same word; so, in fine—as if to protest against too much intellectual pride—\nare \nidea\n and \nimage\n!\nImages can be subconscious and harder to detect than people who have not tried suppose.\nWe can be conscious of one reel unrolling itself—with many crazy interruptions—in our inward\ncinema, and not be quite conscious of another fixed image, visible, but not easily visible,\nthrough the film. Nothing is more frequent than this superposition of two sets of images\nprogressing with variable speeds. They account for the unexpected conclusions at which we\narrive while apparently attentive to entirely different matters. A gentleman whose mind is\noccupied, while reading, with the tiny photographs his memory once took of a house up in\nMaine, may suddenly hear an inward voice say clearly to him: “It is very bad to read when you\nneed not,” and may shut up the book at once. Why? The process of solidification mentioned\nabove would disclose under the Maine film the image of Dr. Wilmer looking rather grave, at the\nlast visit, and since then hardly absent one instant from the subconscious. There would be\nthree strata (perhaps more, of course) perceptible in the same consciousness:\nBook on the Art of Thinking\n \nHouse in Maine\n \nOculist\nSometimes we are aware of a succession of images driving, in fact, telescoping, one another\ntoward a worded conclusion with extraordinary rapidity. The same gentleman whom I am sorry\nto have now made pathetic (but he will never go blind) may come to the unexpected conclusion:\n“I will buy that house in New Jersey!” Incredible! Not at all. The succession of telescoping\nimages may be seen perfectly clearly:\na) House in Maine + slow trains + two changes + cold winters + Joneses near = not wanted.\nb) House in Lakewood (recommended by agent) + good trains = near + no mosquitoes =\nsleep. Sleep + nearness + pine trees + sandy soil = attractive = smile = buy.\nAll these images may succeed one another with the rapidity of lightning, and, as we\ngenerally think of rapidity as a quality of thought, the concatenation will be called thought, but\nin reality it will only be a sequence of images, as usual.\nPretty often, we are conscious of isolated words vaguely obtruding while our mind is thus\nbusy: they are like labels on the silks in a lady’s work-box. More exceptionally, we see or hear a\nwhole scroll of eight or ten words, as the gentleman did, and we are tempted to imagine we\nthink in words, which would be superior to thinking in images. But we do not. The words and\nthe scrolls are there from the habit which most of us have of sometimes audibly whispering:\n“plus seventy-five” while counting \nmoney, or “this must not happen again” when admonishing\nourselves. The inner words are only an anticipation.\nSo, we are confronted with images, images, and more images. Abstractions, being the\nproduct of images, inevitably recall them. It is difficult to think of history without visualizing\ngreat men or some great period, and I doubt if we can mention science without remembering\nfamous experiments. Few words, surely, are as spiritual as the word Truth, but when we hear it\nmentioned, we associate it either with some instance of devotion to truth, or with some\nparticular search which makes us realise the beauty of truth, and, once more, definite\ncontingencies reappear. Needless to point out how closely associated with figures even\ngeometry is. As for logic, it means nothing if it is not pronouncing on congruousness or\nincongruity. Why should it not be the congruousness or incongruity of two images or clusters\nof images, accompanied by an abstract statement? In fact, we are constantly conscious that it is\nso.\nIt will be urged: but is there not in our mind something which is its very nature, and without\nwhich there would be no mind at all?\nI see. You have heard of the principles of pure reason. Well, read the philosophers, and tell\nme if you are much excited, much enlightened, or much impelled to thought by being told that\nwhen you see a billiard ball send another rolling, your intellect registers that nothing happens\nwithout a cause or without sufficient reason. What Kant, or even a more practically inclined\nmetaphysician, like Sir William Hamilton, tells us about the nature of the \nintellect may represent\na powerful mental effort, but the results are not commensurate with it. We can catch a glimpse\nof the working of our mind, vague and not much more satisfactory than was the X-ray screen\ntwenty years ago, but its nature must remain a mystery among many other mysteries. This idea,\nadded to the fact that we are dealing with a practical art, and not with philosophy proper,\nshould reconcile us to our ignorance.\n\n2. HOW TO ESTIMATE THOUGHT\nThe quality of a man’s thinking may seem difficult to detect on account of the various strata\nunder which real thought generally is hiding, but, if introspection is applied, all the apparent\ndifficulty vanishes. An experiment or two will make it clear that the criteria of estimation of a\nman’s thought are, first, the images on which it exercises itself; second, the likes and dislikes\ncorresponding to these images, and lastly, the mental energy which enables us to combine\nintellectual data with more or less success.\nIt is evident that a person whose mind is filled with the images of petty pleasure, comfort,\ngood food, good clothes, dancing, traveling, amusing company, in short, material well-being, is\nfarther away from what we call thought than the person whose imagination will be engrossed\nby beautiful scenes—Italian scenery, for instance—with noble fabrics, the quaintness or the\nappeal of antiquity, churches and museums full of the realisation of beauty, and the\nrecollections of great artistic lives everywhere. The superiority of an artist to a society man or\nwoman who is nothing else is undisputed, and it comes from no other cause than the\nsuperiority of one class of images to another. Again, when the mind of a Ruskin or a William\nMorris is inhabited, not solely by images of sensuous beauty, but by visions of a better and\nhappier mankind, we bow to nobler images than those which delight the mere artist. It \nis not\ndifficult to go up the scale of moral values attached to magnetic images by visualizing in\nsuccession those characteristic of the patriot, the social reformer, the moral reformer, the saint\nor the great religious interpreter. These images become more and more sublimized, but they are\nas vivid to the mystic as to the artist. What visions pass through our mind when it is at leisure,\nwhat scenes do we spontaneously imagine? We should know, for the mere description of\nintrospection is inevitably followed by an experiment. So we can be our own judges. The\nthought is rather formidable.\nOf course, our likes and dislikes are of the same order with the images corresponding to\nthem, and it would be tedious to dwell at any length on the subject. It is evident that any\nimages of which we have no particular right to be proud would not be frequent in our minds if\nthey were met with the "

      "chapter_text": "verdict: not wanted, not liked.\nOn the other hand, attention should be drawn to the fact that most people are more\nconscious of their dislikes than of their sympathies. The latter are weak while hatreds are\nstrong. It is one of the humiliating features of human nature that we resent a few little things\nwhich happen to irritate us more than we appreciate a great deal for which we ought to be\ngrateful. A traveler’s point of view can be modified quite unjustly because, during the last few\ndays of his visit, he has been unlucky enough to meet bores, fools, or bullies. But sometimes he\nprefers meeting them because he enjoys grievances, and irritation agrees with him. A critic who\nfeels like praising a book will gladly damn it if the last chapter antagonizes some pet idea of his.\nHigh-minded \nmen and women endowed with warm natures are almost invariably optimistic,\neven when they realise the rottenness of the world, but how few they are! It is striking to reflect\nthat Antoine, the Belgian faith-healer, made a European reputation by preaching love of our\nenemies—a doctrine so traditional (theoretically) for Christians. Thousands fortunately took it\nas a novelty and were enthusiastic in consequence.\nAnother symptom or cause of the pessimistic tendency is the presence in our\nconsciousness or subconsciousness of the depressing mental habits which Freudians call\ncomplexes\n. We shall revert to them in the second part of this book but we must note them here\nat once because their effects cannot be overlooked in an estimation of the quality of our\nthinking.\nIntrospection can be supplemented and controlled by two sources of information which we\ncan hardly hold in suspicion: our private letters, and above all our talk. Both are open to the full\nlight of wide-awake consciousness and need not be investigated through the more\npsychological process. What are we hearing ourselves say? Are we satisfied with merely\nspeaking the exterior or interior cinema? (“This car is going too fast.” . . . “I wish we had a\nStudebaker.” . . . “I feel quite ready for tea.”) In the same way, are not our letters full of small talk\nand cheap details, different from the cook’s only by virtue of a little more grammar and spelling?\nDoes not our pleasure in criticizing rather than appreciating break out in many sentences\nbeginning “I hate,” “I detest,” “I despise,” “how I loathe” \n. . . and so forth? If so, we cannot\nhelp escaping the self-pronounced verdict: ORDINARY.\nThe third element to be taken into consideration if we want our inventory to be complete is\nmental resilience. Glibness, confidence, a retentive memory enabling its possessor to air easily\nacquired, sometimes shamelessly pirated, knowledge, can deceive observation at first, but not\nfor long. As a rule, we can tell which of two men is the more energetic thinker as we can tell in a\nnatatorium who is the swiftest swimmer. As for our estimate of our own mental elasticity, it is a\nmatter of mere honesty requiring only the simplest investigation. If our mind is little better than\nthe cinema mentioned above, we do not think any more than does a mirror. If we are bored by\nany topic above those which give food to our small dislikes or even smaller likes, we do not\nthink. If, the moment a book or a newspaper raises a question demanding some supplementary\ninformation or reflection, we yawn, fidget, or hurriedly do something else, we abhor thinking. If,\nwhen trying to reflect, we at once feel a weariness, a drowsiness or a tendency to repeat mere\nwords, we do not know what thought is. If we do know what it is, but, as Montaigne says, are\ntoo lazy to tackle a problem with more than “a charge or two,” we are feeble thinkers. Then what\nare we really?\nCopy-cats, humble slaves imitating their masters. When a traveller visits the United States\nfor the first time he cannot help noticing a curious phenomenon. Americanization, the\ntransforming of foreign dissimilarity into American conformity, is not done, as Americanizing\ncentres imagine, by the substitution \nof a new set of ideas for another. The thing is done more\nsimply. Long before the new arrival begins to know the language which he calls the American,\nand even before changing his name from Silvio into Sullivan, he is trying to be as American as\nhis simple resources will let him. He shaves off his moustache and has his hair cut in the most\nmilitary style. He goes to games and quickly learns to yell. Soon he begins to suppress the\nnative vivacity on his face and replaces it by good-natured slowness. Nine times out of ten you\nwill see him copy the hesitancy before speaking accompanied by a mute motion of the lips\nwhich is frequent in Americans of his class. He has no difficulty in adopting the salute with the\nhand which possibly America has borrowed from his Roman ancestors. He has been told,\nbefore leaving Naples, that a good American consists largely of good clothes, and his first\nmoney goes to that. He has no doubt that a country in which a boy of eighteen makes a\nhundred and fifty \nlire\n a day cannot but be God’s own country. The notion gives him a horror\nfor the smells of Italy. Shortly after this he has the revelation of the abyss there is between “the\ngirls” and “le donne.” By the time he can write home that he now speaks the “American” he is\nready to make the world safe, at any cost, for democracy and the American woman, and he\nshould be given his papers without another week’s delay. The whole process has come from\noutside and its chief element may have been the mute motion of the lips which is a symptom of\nhigh receptivity.\nWhat do most people do who are not poor emigrants but “people”? Do they not consist of\nclothes, fashions, mannerisms, formulas (listen to what you \nhear at the opera or at art\nexhibitions)? Are not only their attitudes, but even their attitude before life, copied from models\napproved for standardization? Are not their lives all alike?\nMost of this questioning is superfluous. We know that nineteen people in twenty do not\nthink but live like automata. I once reproached Mr. Arnold Bennett for entitling one of his\nbooks \nHow to Live on Twenty-four Hours a Day\n. This title evidently suggests a book for hectic\npeople in quest of a method to compress forty-eight hours into twenty-four. On the contrary,\nthe book is destined for idle people and intended to make them live twenty-four hours a day.\nThe real title ought to have been: “How to Live Twenty-four Hours,” or “an hour” or “ten\nminutes” a day. For most people do not live even that long a day, and Mr. Bennett’s book was\nworth writing.\n\n3. REAL THINKING\nEnter thinker.\nWe have all seen him standing amidst the surprised, incredulous and often silly group of\nnon-thinkers. Sometimes he is a very simple man, the roadside mechanic slowly walking out of\nhis garage. Round the car two or three men, hot with ineffective guessing, are still talking\nexcitedly when the taciturn man appears; for an hour they have talked, tried and failed. They\nstop and not another word is heard. The intelligent eyes of the artisan, helped by his seemingly\ninfallible hands, go over the organs of the machine; meanwhile we know that his mind is going\nover dozens of hypotheses which to us are only riddles. Soon the trouble is found. Sometimes\nthe man smiles. At what? At whom? I often wonder. At any rate we have felt the presence of a\nbrain.\nA score of medical students are standing round a bed: three or four of them have examined\nthe patient and an interne is now doing it, for the case is exceptionally interesting and may go\non record. Every now and then the young doctor says a few words which a score of pencils\nnote down. But a flutter passes over the little crowd. The \npatron\n, Potain himself, is here. He has\nheard of this case and wants to see for himself. In a few moments his magnificent head bends\ntowards the patient and a scene, unforgettable to those who once witnessed it, \nbegins. Not a\nword. The splendid intelligence of the famous physician now abides in his ear. With closed\neyes and a marvellous receptivity over his face, Potain listens. At intervals something like\nbeatitude in his expression shows that this examination goes well: every infinitesimal sound,\nevery absence of sound is interrogated: the students know that even a crease in the pleura\nbecomes visible to this prodigious man as he listens. Half an hour passes without one of these\nyoung men getting tired of this scene, however mute, and entirely given up to thought. At last\nPotain"

If you have looked at it for only\nten seconds, you will never forget the eyes, clear, hard, harsh, cold and sharp as steel. Artists\noften possess those eyes less made to love reality, as people say, than to go straight to its\nessentials. Degas had that kind of eyes. Lucien Simon has them. Forain, at nearly eighty, still\nhas them. Not very long ago, I saw those eyes in the head of a smartly dressed, dark-looking\nyoung painter, outside the “Ruche,” in Vaugirard: he interested me and our glances were like\ncrossed swords, high above the sphere of mere politeness. Those eyes see where others see\nnot. What is the power of a Napoleon, even of a Mussolini? Not mere “power,” but magnetism,\nand the magnetism is more intelligence than force. Such men \nsee\n, they see the necessities of an\nepoch, and woe to the people who will not see them as they do! The contempt of the eagle for\ncrawling creatures will fall upon them.\nI remember once taking Angellier,\n[1]\n rather by surprise, to a drawing-room which the Quality\nwas filling with the soft hubbub of elegant nothingness. He sat down and listened. Certainly he\nhad a head which even conventionality at its worst could not pass by, a superb head so well\npoised on athletic shoulders that many people imagined the man was tall, though he was not.\nBut, above all, he had a power of attention, so visible in his deep sunken eyes that it actually\nseemed to throw out a net on the exterior world. The disproportion between what Angellier\nseemed to expect and what he was treated to, that afternoon, could not be left unnoticed, yet in\na few minutes the conversation became more substantial, every word of it addressed to this\nunknown man with the expectant face. Soon, too, the reward came. Angellier was seized by his\ndemon and gave us of his best: a succession of illuminating statements which his\nShakespearean metaphors clothed in magical brilliance. A rare spectacle. It recalled Angellier’s\nown description of Robert Burns in the Edinburgh drawing-rooms.\nAll great men, you say, all more or less famous men! True, but is there a single human being\nwho does not know in his immediate vicinity a man or woman gifted with a power of intellectual\nvision so superior to the average as to be striking? Is there \na village where some tavern star\ndoes not play the part acted by Branwell Brontë in Haworth? Is there a single family, or little\nsocial circle, without its \ntintinnajo\n, the family oracle of whom it is said, when difficult questions\nare at issue: Oh! \nhe\n will see the whole thing? Few conversations pass without our making the\nmental note: I had not thought of that. It means that somebody, perhaps accidentally, has been\na thinker. Shortly after the Russian Revolution, in 1917, half a dozen people in a Paris salon were\nindulging in the then familiar pastime of comparing the Czar with Louis the Sixteenth, the\nCzarina with Marie-Antoinette, Kerensky with the Girondists, etc., so that the future of Russia\ncould easily be inferred from the history of the French Revolution. Somebody said: “Oh! you\nthink the crisis is over, don’t you? But what is that Council of Soldiers and Workmen which\nmeets at the Finland Station? Wait; you will see what comes out of that.” A brilliant intuition,\nwhich, in a few weeks, facts began to corroborate.\nSuch experiences are familiar to all of us and often leave a deep impression behind them. We\nlove to see the thinker in action, for his personality, joined to the unexpectedness of his\nperformances, acts upon us even more than the illumination he provides. Nobody denies that\nthought, like oratory, gains by being drunk at the spring. The Port-Royalists appreciated\nnothing in Pascal so much as what they called his “eloquence”: to them the word did not mean,\nas it does to us, persuasive rhetoric, but a capacity for the ready expression of thoughts\ndifficult to clothe in words. Probably their interest in the almost indecipherable memoranda left\nby the \nphilosopher lay in the hope that these scraps of paper might revive the impression of his\noriginality. Readers of Boswell do not doubt that Johnson was an extraordinary\nconversationalist, but how few students of English literature have a clear notion that a decade\nor two of the eighteenth century would never have been called the Age of Johnson had it been\nonly for the \nDictionary\n, \nRasselas\n or the \nLives of the Poets\n? Johnson’s genius was in his talk\nand not in his books. As Léon Daudet says it, à propos of Marcel Proust, we love a\nconversation “full of flowers and stars,” the stars being the rare thoughts and the flowers their\nfascinating expression.\nYet, from time to time, we see a thinker’s ideas progress independently of him, either\nbecause the thinker was not eloquent, or because his ideas were difficult to grasp, or because\nthe man himself remained nebulous to his contemporaries. This phenomenon cannot but give\nus an exalted idea of the greatness of thought. Measure Descartes, the refugee to Holland, or\nhis disciple Spinoza, the artisan, or that typical provincial professor, Kant, or Karl Marx, by\nconfronting their personalities with their influence. The contrast between those humble lives\nand the mental effervescence they have left behind them is startling. One flash through a\nhuman brain, and, in spite of a total lack of worldly influence, in spite of the recondite character\nof the doctrines, in spite of the absence of literary talent, the whole intellectual trend of\nmankind will be changed for several generations. Much more spectacular the process is when\nthe man’s personality is as powerful as his influence (Julius Cæsar, Napoleon), but it is not \nso\nextraordinary. Thought can indeed be called divine, for it is creative.\nW\nHAT\n is it that characterises the thinker? First of all, and obviously, vision: the word underlies\nevery line of the descriptions above. The thinker is preëminently a man who sees where others\ndo not. The novelty of what he says, its character as a sort of revelation, the charm that\nattaches to it, all come from the fact that he sees. He seems to be head and shoulders above the\ncrowd, or to be walking on the ridge-way while others trudge at the bottom. Independence is\nthe word which describes the moral aspect of this capacity for vision. Nothing is more striking\nthan the absence of intellectual independence in most human beings: they conform in opinion,\nas they do in manners, and are perfectly content with repeating formulas. While they do so, the\nthinker calmly looks round, giving full play to his mental freedom. He may agree with the\nconsensus\n known as public opinion, but it will not be because it is universal opinion. Even the\nsacrosanct thing called plain common-sense is not enough to intimidate him into conformity.\nWhat could seem nearer to insanity, in the sixteenth century, than a denial of the fact—for it\nwas a fact—that the sun revolves round the earth? Galileo did not mind: his intellectual bravery\nshould be even more surprising to us than his physical courage. But, three hundred years later,\nit was no less difficult for Henri Poincaré to assert that there was as much scientific truth in the\nold notion as in Galileo’s doctrine. Einstein’s \ndenial of the principle that two parallels can never\nmeet is another stupendous proof of intellectual independence.\nGenius of the most exceptional order is necessary for such achievements, you say.\nEvidently. But it took no mathematics to feel sure, as Mussolini did, that, at times, tyranny is\nmore beneficial than freedom; yet, Mussolini alone realised this notion with its wealth of\nconsequences. How many people, in August 1914, shook their heads at the world’s certainty\nthat the war could not last more than three or four months? Very few. Hundreds of people in\nEurope are trying to protect pedestrians from motorists; only one, that I know of, ever thought\nof the radical measure which alone would compel the motorist to slacken his speed: take away\nhis Klaxon from him. Everybody laughs at the bombastic eloquence resounding in Parliament-\nhouses, and obviously destined for some far-away constituency. There "

How many Americans realize that their country is not a democracy but an\noligarchy, and owes a good deal of its stability to that fact? How many Frenchmen see—for it\ncan be seen—the contrast between their modern architecture and the sublime or exquisite\nmonuments scattered all over their soil? Indeed the world lives on words which it goes on\nrepeating till some thinker, or repeated experience—\nexperientia magistra stultorum\n—makes a\nbreach in the solid and stolid wall of conformity.\nPeople who think for themselves often appear haughty and self-satisfied, because they can\nhardly \nbe dissatisfied with themselves, or irreverent, because they knock down idols and\ncannot but enjoy the sport. Men of the intellectual type of Mr. Bernard Shaw would evidently\nbe sorry if all silly people suddenly became as wise as themselves. Hating folly and playing\nwith it rather cruelly is a healthy exercise of the faculties: the Bible abounds with instances.\nThinkers are also apt to appear dictatorial, to compel people to follow in their wake. The reason\nis because seeing the truth—whose other name is salvation—and realising that other people\nwill not see it, they treat them as grown-ups must treat children. Once more Mussolini can be\nused as an instance in point. But, in their innermost nature, thinkers are preëminently teachers,\nand it is to the credit of most of them that they devote their lives to preaching the truth they\nsee. Some of them do so in admirable speeches or books, others in the picturesque language of\nthe artist, but, whatever the vehicle, the devotion to truth remains visible. Some literary men\nappear original because of the bizarre character of their expression; but the least effort to boil\ndown their most arresting page to its salt of pure thought will show that they have little to say:\nnot being able to pose as teachers, they must be content with imitating the acrobat who makes\na speech standing on his head while gesticulating with his legs. Such men will find imitators but\nno followers, whereas the thinker, whether he wishes it or not, is a leader.\n[1]\nAuguste Angellier (1848-1912), professor of English Literature in Lille\nand Paris, critic and poet. His two volumes on Robert Burns and his sonnets\nA l’Amie Perdue\n are his chief titles to fame. His personal influence was\nextraordinary.\n\n4. POSSIBILITY OF AN ART OF THINKING\nWhat is our reaction in the presence of a thinker? The same that we experience in the presence\nof beauty: we are surprised at first, but immediately after, we admire. Only, with some people\nadmiration is accompanied by discouragement, with others it creates emulation. Purely literary\npeople who think too much of brilliance are early dazzled by it into inertness. Average people\nreact differently. The more confident almost invariably think: “What a shame that I should not\ntalk like that! I might have. If only I had had this man’s chances, his education, his experience of\ntravel, his connection with people accustomed to a higher kind of conversation, or only even to\na better vocabulary, I should not be the dumb, dull creature I must appear to be.” In their hearts,\nthey think distinction is found, not gained, and they blame destiny. Others suspect under it all a\nrecipe which they do not know but might learn. “Tell me how!” they seem to say, and entertain\nnot a doubt that, if they were given the formula, results would immediately follow. Apart from\nthe stupid listeners who regard a brilliant conversationalist much as a miserly old French farmer\nregards a generous American, that is to say, as a freak, people feel a kinship between\nthemselves and the more gifted specimens of mankind. The only difference they see between\nthe latter and themselves is accidental and likely to be effaced in an instant: in \nother words,\nthey believe in an Art of Thinking.\nWhy do they? Simply because the most ordinary of us know moments during which we\nglimpse the very states of mind which brilliant conversation mirrors. Anybody familiar with\ncountry people, even of the most uncultivated sort, realises that they appreciate natural beauty,\na landscape, the last smile of autumn on a wood, a sunset, the flash of a wild bird, quite as\nmuch as a professional artist or versifier. All they lack is words or oftener confidence; many of\nthem are as loath to speak of their innermost loves as to change their accent.\nHumdrum people cease to be humdrum when they hear a fine speech or read the kind of\nbook likely to act on their dormant possibilities. Perhaps one human being in a thousand is\nabsolutely impervious to the charm of music: the rest, no matter how crude, cannot hear Taps or\nle Chant du Départ\n, or a good organ, or a girl’s song on a warm evening, without a beginning\nof intoxication which differs only in degree from the mental condition in which Shelley\nproduced \nThe Skylark\n. A tumult of seldom experienced and consequently more valued\nintellectual impressions, with the sensation of an unwonted warmth round the heart, are known\nto all men and women. We all treasure the recollection of such moments, and we never become\nquite so ossified by what is called life and its hardening influence as not to wish for their return.\nEverybody too is conscious of spells during which his mind is at its best, works swiftly and\ninfallibly. Insomnia, before ending in exhaustion, generally produces a lucidity which no\namount of normal meditation will replace, and the vigils of literary men \ntestify to the fact.\nProlonged solitude accompanied by a little fasting acts in the same way. This too is known to\nall literary people. Dickens used to walk and walk through the streets of London in the small\nhours of the night when he could meet only sleepy policemen or stray cats. Most writers realise\nthat their books are only written, not lived, when they cannot separate themselves from their\nfamilies and seek the quiet of an old town or remote country inn where nobody speaks to them.\nLet anybody try the experiment of crossing the ocean on one of the quieter boats without\nmaking anybody’s acquaintance. He will find, after three or four days, that his mind is not the\nsame. The ten days’, or even thirty days’ silent retreats, in use in some religious orders, are the\noutcome of such experiences.\nWere it even without the comparatively frequent recurrence of exalted moments breaking\nour routine, we could, all of us, be conscious of what is going on in the thinker’s mind by\nrecalling our childhood. All children under nine or ten years of age are poets and philosophers.\nThey pretend to live with the rest of us, and the rest of us imagine that we influence them so\nthat their lives are only a reflection of our own. But, as a matter of fact, they are as self-\ncontained as cats and as continuously attentive to the magical charm of what they see\ninwardly. Their mental wealth is extraordinary; only the greatest artists or poets, whose\nresemblance to children is a banal certainty, can give us some idea of it. A golden-haired little\nfellow playing with his blocks in the garden may be conscious all the time of the sunset while\npretending not to look at it. “Come along!” the nurse said to Félicité de la Mennais, eight years\nold, “you have looked long enough at those waves and everybody is going away.” The\nanswer: “\nIls regardent ce que je regarde, mais ils ne voient pas ce que je vois\n,”\n[2]\n was no brag,\nbut merely a plea to stay on. Who can tell what the four Brontë tots saw or did not see in the\nmoors through which, day after day, they rambled holding hands? Cannot you remember\nlooking for long spells at a mere patch of red on a sheet of paper or in your little paint-box?\nMost intelligent children, as was the case with Newman, have the philosopher’s doubts about\nthe existence of the world. You see them looking curiously at a stone; you think “children are\nso funny” and all the time they are wondering if the stone may not be eternal, and what it is to\nbe eternal. Have I not heard a little girl of nine interrupt a conversation of professors who were\ntalking about nothing to ask the astounding question: “Father, what is beauty? What makes\nit?”\nThis superiority of intellect persists until the child’s imitativeness begins to work from the\noutside in. When Jack begins to copy Daddy’s way of shaking his head or shrugging his\nshoulders, his poor little soul also begins to be sati"

      "chapter_text": "sfied with dismissing questions. Pretty soon\nthis magnificent tide of interest which fills the child’s soul will ebb away to leave it dry and arid.\nThere may be occasional returns of it. All school-boys, writing an essay for their teacher, are\nvisited by thoughts which they realize would be what is called literature, but they do not dare\nto write them down, and ill-treated inspiration, in its turn, does not dare to return. It is \nto those\nmoments that such of us whose vocation turns out to be literary look back with despair,\nwondering what brought a crop of platitudes where distinction used to spring naturally. Only in\na Blake or a Whitman is the passage from the child to the artist imperceptible.\nPeople forget their childhood, no doubt, and it is a loss which, no matter how lightly they\ntake it, is irreparable. But, for a long time, they remember it, and, more or less consciously, they\ntry to relive it. It does not occur to one in a thousand, of course, that he was more intelligent\nwhen he was eight than now when he is fifty, but it is no less true that the relationship we feel\nbetween ourselves and even the man who dazzles us is founded on recollections of great hours\nor on recollections of childhood; “I have deteriorated” we rightly think; or “I am a victim, I have\nhad no luck.” Pretty often, too, we hear the inward admission immediately followed by a more\nhopeful feeling: “I am in a rut, I know, but if I would make the least effort, move only one line,\nsay: ‘henceforth I will talk no more nonsense,’ in an instant I could be outside of the herd of the\nunthinking to become one of the few leading it.” A trifle, a mere nothing, the buzz of a fly or the\nbang of a door may be enough to disturb this mood and bring back commonplace thoughts in\nfull force; but it is no less true that, during a few moments, we have been separated from a\nhigher mental life only by a vision which we realized was within reach and by an effort which\ndid not seem to be an exertion.\nAll this amounts to saying that we have a natural belief in the existence of an ART OF\nTHINKING. \nSome men possess it, others not; but those who do not possess it must blame\nthemselves.\nIs this a real intuition? Must we really believe that the constant surging of thought and\nfeeling in myriads of souls is as much of a waste as the useless effort of the waves? Was Gray\nright in thinking that:\nFull many a gem of purest ray serene,\nThe dark unfathom’d caves of ocean bear;\nFull many a flower is born to blush unseen\nAnd waste its sweetness on the desert air.\nWho can doubt it? Was not Robert Burns separated from illiteracy by the merest accident?\nWho does not see the element of luck in Shakespeare’s life? Does not the life of Rimbaud\ndemonstrate that a man can be two men? People who knew only M. Rimbaud, the East African\ndealer, in his counting-house, must have been astounded when told that this was Rimbaud,\nRimbaud the genius, Rimbaud, who, before he was nineteen, had written immortal poems, but\nwho despised literature ever after. What happened to Balzac? Here was a man who, between his\ntwentieth and his twenty-ninth year, consistently wrote trash and, after that, produced nothing\nbut masterpieces. Is it not evident to even a casual student of his development that the healthy\nworking of his mind was hampered at first by the imitation of English novelists who had little in\ncommon with him, and only began to act freely when dealing with the data in his own\nexperience? How can the historian of art or literature account for the marvellous growth of such\nepochs as the age of Pericles or the thirteenth century without exceptionally \nfavorable\ncircumstances preventing the waste of talent? Such periods testify to the existence, not of\nsuperhuman capacities in a few hundred individuals, but to that of a happy atmosphere helping\nthe growth of the many. Medieval anonymity is another evidence of the diffusion of talent in\nthose fortunate ages. Russians are supposed to have rare facilities for the acquisition of\nlanguages. Would it not be better to say that most nations look upon the acquisition of\nlanguages with a dread paralyzing the individual’s possibilities? I have seen at least two French\npeople, born in Russia, show the so-called Russian genius for languages, and an Englishman\nwho never manages to learn more than a hundred words of Hindustani will not be surprised to\nsee his children pick up three or four Hindoo dialects in the bazaars of Rangoon. Produce\ncertain favorable conditions and you produce the Art of Thinking. The question is, how to\nproduce those conditions, but it is not, by any means, a disheartening one.\n[2]\n“They watch what I am watching, but they do not see what I see.”\nPart Two\nOBSTACLES TO THOUGHT\nINTRODUCTORY\nIt is obvious that the chief obstacle to thought is stupidity, that is to say a congenital\nincapacity for thinking. However, no abnormal condition will be dealt with in the following\npages. Most people who, in perfect good faith, tackle psychoanalysis, in the hope of bettering\nthemselves, are repulsed by the fact that practically all Freudians seem interested only in\nmedical cases. The man who has no reason to doubt that he is normal, but is conscious, like\nevery one of us, of those obsessions now currently called inferiority complexes and wants to\nget rid of them, turns away in disgust from literature filled with hospital experience. This book\nis intended for average minds equally remote from genius which knows no obstacles, or from\nstupidity to which everything is an obstacle. It presupposes average lives finding the usual\nchances and encountering only the usual difficulties.\nIn the same way, no attention will be given to what is the main cause of human errors, viz:\npassion. It seems at first sight illogical to brush aside self-love, prejudice, and the\ninnumerable likes or dislikes which prevent us from seeing even facts as they are, or inferring\nfrom them their natural conclusions. But the subject of this book is the production, not the\nguidance of thought, and its every chapter takes it for granted that we are honest in our wish\nto produce unadulterated thought.\n\n1. OBSESSIONS OR INFERIORITY COMPLEXES\nWe all know them. We are all conscious of a double state of mind in which, behind a fascinating\nobject, we see a threatening or discouraging phantasm doing its best to neutralize the healthy\ninfluence we would love not to lose. For instance, we see somebody we know engaged in a\nFrench conversation with a foreigner. How exquisite is distinguished, well-modulated French!\nWhat fluidity the loosening influence of the mute \ne\n and the nonchalance of the \nn\n sounds give\nto that language. Why, that girl seems to speak like a native. I had no idea she did. Not a trace\nof effort on her part, and that Frenchman does not seem conscious of talking with a foreigner. It\nis really wonderful. How absurd that I should have given up French! I still read it without much\ndifficulty when I have to, but it is not often, and if I had to talk, I know I should be ridiculous. I\nreally must do something. This very evening I will begin. Our French teacher used to say that if\nwe would learn ten words a day, which is nothing, we should know almost four thousand words\nin a year, which sounds like a lot. Why should I not do it? Of course I will. And in a year and a\nhalf, I shall go to Tours or Grenoble to practise my four or five thousand words on harmonious\nnatives. That’s really worth doing, instead of going to silly plays.\nTen o’clock at night. Chardenal, the French Dictionary, Mérimée’s \nColomba\n, and an\naustere-looking \nvocabulary once bought in a hotel lobby are on the table. They do not look as\nattractive as that conversation sounded. Chardenal does not look attractive at all. Yet, the\ngrammar must be swallowed, verbs and all. Here are the four conjugations, not one less than\nlast time the book was opened, and as merciless as ever. (\nEnter phantasms as bad as\nphantoms.\n) Of course, people with excellent memories can learn those verbs, but my memory is\nnot good. Ten words a day is nothing, Mademoiselle used to say. Then, why is it that not a\nsingle girl learned them then, or has learned them since? Everybody imagined she would do it,\nbut in fact nobody did. I have no perseverance. I have not even perseverance enough to\nreduce. I am not like So and So. No perseverance. So it is useless to try. Besides, is it so\nnecessary that I should know French? Everything gets translated, and, when Sorel or Guitry\n"

      "chapter_text": "come over, you can always guess a little and pretend a little. As everybody does it, and if I did\nknow French nobody would believe that I did, it does not matter. After all there are other useful\nthings besides French. That lecturer the other day pointed out quite correctly that we talk\nabout Shakespeare all the time but read him about as much as the Bible. Let me read\nShakespeare. One act every night should see me through in five or six months. I’ll finish this\ntrashy, amusing book I began last night, but immediately after I shall start on \nTitus Andronicus\n.\nMemory not good. No perseverance. What’s the good? So and So can do it, but I cannot.\nAll these disheartening little visions are what Miss Austen’s characters used to call the\n“blues,” not \nidées noires\n, \nbut \nidées bleu foncé\n, not exactly obsessions, but parasitical\nobstructions. They all rush to the attack of a nascent volition and try to crush it out. If it shows\na little fight in its desire to become a resolve, the hostile phantasms come back seven times\nmore numerous and charge again till they firmly implant the inferiority complex: “I can’t do it, it\ncan’t be done.”\nIf we will indulge in a little introspection we shall find that our mind is peopled with more\nincipient obsessions than ideas, and that their presence is largely the cause of our impotency.\nInferiority complexes are not always the result of the presence of shadows like those I have\njust mentioned. It is sufficient that some purpose or desire, foreign to the thought or possibility\nof thought we are pursuing, should step in to arrest the process of effective thinking. Many\npeople act in daily life a character not their own, and the working of their minds is hopelessly\nvitiated by the constant effort. Quite a few Englishmen, having trimmed their beards so as to\nlook like Edward VII or George V, have never been themselves afterwards. Their thoughts,\nwords and actions have been those of actors. I used to meet in Paris a man who looked\nmiraculously like Alfred de Musset. But he was not Alfred de Musset, alas! and as he had\npersuaded himself he was no longer Dupont or Durand, he was nothing at all. Politicians\nfrequently act historical characters and their natural insincerity becomes tenfold in\nconsequence. People who begin to possess a language well enough to imagine that they may\npass for natives, but have not really mastered it enough to use it as their instrument, can be\nfrequently \ndetected acting Italian exuberance, French vivacity, or British stolidity. Few students\nwho have completely annexed a foreign language have escaped that rather ignominious phase;\nand they must admit that, as long as it lasted, their thoughts were not quite their own, but the\nreflection of some fancied Italian, French, or English type. One cannot exaggerate the influence\nof the English-American language in the Americanization of aliens.\nSocial intercourse with its requirements and its indulgence,—its hypocrisy, to call it by its\nname,—is highly productive of thought-hindering insincerity. How many people dare to say\nthey have not read the book which three or four other people in a drawing room are discussing\nin non-committal language? How many are brave enough not to join in with an “oh! yes,\ncharming book!” which does not deceive anybody, but which strengthens the soul-devastating\nhabit of saying something when one has nothing to say. There is a quite as shameful \nvia media\nbetween deceit and sincerity which consists in buying the book even if it is never to be\nopened. Casual inspection of some people’s shelves is illuminating. The leaves of a certain\ncategory of favorites are uncut. I have no doubt that the success, not long ago, of one\nphilosophical best seller was of the uncut description.\nThe same comedy is acted especially by callow young people who put on a profound air of\nhaving mastered it all. They affect the cant of sciences or arts about which they know nothing.\nWhat does one hear at picture exhibitions? It takes even less knowledge to display an after-the-\nconcert appreciation summed up in “line, color and sonority.”\nThe desire to appear, instead of really being, can vitiate even the legitimate operation of the\nintellect. Two men can be supposed, for example, to apply their minds with equal intensity to\nthe question of the origins of the great war. If one of the two wants to display in his mastery of\nthis question either his patriotism or his internationalism he will produce thought of a quality\ninferior to the other man’s, whose sole object is to discover facts. The reason is that at every\nstep onwards which he takes in his investigation, the former student sees himself using the\ninformation just gained, and the vision, like any parasitical phantasm, weakens, because it\ndivides, his thinking power. Again, listen to a speech or read a poem with a view to\nremembering it: you will remember it better, no doubt, but your impression of the oratory or of\nthe poetic charm will be diminished by the extraneous preoccupation.\nTwo notions juxtaposed in the mind invariably hinder its working. You do not see a picture\nas it really is when you have been told it is a copy whereas it really is original. The moment you\nhear that it is not a copy, the picture returns on you with an energy it did not possess a few\nminutes before. The only comparison that seems adequate is your surprise when you discover\nthat what you thought was only a flaw in the window-pane really is a large kite in the sky: you\nactually see the tiny dot grow ten times as large as it seemed before. Exactly the same\nphenomenon can take place in our minds. We may have known a person, older than we are, for\nmany years without realising, one may say without seeing, his face: one day we suddenly see it\nand we are shocked to find it is an old face.\nWe live on notions and with notions. I have seen an intelligent and even, at times,\nscintillating man deteriorate long before his time, because he used at first to save every brilliant\nthought coming to him, for a better occasion, and gradually resent even producing such\nthoughts, as the torpedo-fish may resent discharging his electricity in the conviction that it\nmust exhaust him. His registering every intellectual operation he was conscious of interfered\nwith them all till, in time, he was a mere wreck. Methodicalness pushed to an extreme is well\nknown to produce similar effects, because it becomes a haunting phantasm.\nI\nT\n would seem as if writers who are professionally trained to watch the operation of their minds,\nand in whose Mss. one is sure to find rich material for the composition of an Art of Thinking,\nought to be freer than the rest of mankind from those blighting shadows. But it is not so. Most\nwriters endowed with the real literary gift are nervous subjects, or at all events, exceptionally\nsensitive individuals on whose imaginations all impressions work freely and often cruelly. The\nRomanticists were proud of this sensitiveness and tire us by too frequent allusions to it, but it\nexists all the same, even in apparently robust intellects. In fact, it is one of the literary\nprofessional characteristics and is limited to the professional field. A number of literary people\nfind relaxation in drawing and do so without any consciousness of their usual trammels. On the\nother hand, the careless and even reckless freedom of many artists, when they happen to write,\nfrequently excites the envy of their purely literary brethren.\nA writer is a man whose inner life is intended for public inspection. Unless he feel powerful\nenough to take this ordeal as a matter of course he is apt to think too continuously of this\ninevitable exposition of himself, and the consciousness of it is a weakening phantasm. Nobody\nknows so well as the writer that he should not think of two things at a time, but nobody is more\ninclined than he to do so. Even that perfect collector of mere facts, that incarnation of\nunperturbed erudition, old Varro, has noted it. He actually says, in pithy Latin, that the man who\ninforms himself in order to retail his information to others is a prey, while so doing, to an\ninferiority complex.\nThe writer is constantly beset with phantasms. Taine was haunted with a desire to hit upon\nan impossible world-mirroring formula, until the study of history cured him of this yearning by\nsubstituting such a simple summary of what history teaches us that, at first, the author was\nashamed of it. A kindred phantasm is the fear of seeing only one a"

      "chapter_text": "spect of the subject one is\nstudying. Carlyle admits that he knew this obsession and had to make a desperate effort to\novercome it. The writer is not afraid of mere critics—they belong to his own craft and he is\nready to fight them with all professional weapons, including contempt—but he dreads the smile\nof imaginary readers, men or women, whom he has never met and who possibly do not exist,\nbut whom he sees, in his mind’s eye, as the realisation of all he would wish to be, mastering his\nsubject as if they were giants. The obsession becomes worse when the formidable reader is\nknown to be in the flesh. Most of Angellier’s pupils have become writers: I have \nnever known\none who did not shiver at the idea of his master’s good-natured criticisms, ruthless because\nthey pointed out so infallibly the incompleteness of the disciple’s outlook. Yet, Angellier\nhimself was not always the olympian he seemed to be: the moment he thought of his own works\nhe frequently showed anxiety or even depression, wondering at what height his inspiration\nreally placed him, wistfully mindful not only of the greatest and strongest, but even of minors\nwith a delicate handling of subtle nuances, dreading to be inferior to what he had felt himself to\nbe in his first great effort, \nl’Amie Perdue\n, uncertain whether the subjects he was attracted by\nwere in his best vein, and, during many years,—in fact, till he recovered some of his mother’s\nreligious belief,—staking his hope of immortality on the survival of some of his poems in the\nprecarious memory of future generations.\nNobody can tell how many sterling literary vocations have been ruined by the notion that it\nis useless to repeat what must have been said many times in the past. Men like Amiel, or, before\nhim, Joubert or Doudan, only escaped from this phantasm by writing things which they\nimagined nobody else would ever read. On the few occasions when they did write for the\npublic, the cramping influence became visible at once.\nThe list of such influences hindering a gifted man’s thinking could be endless. I cannot help\nadding that even a man as deliberately free from any clogging accretions as Jules Lemaître\nadmits that the effort to visualise the past can become an obsession: its victim walks through\nthe delightful quaintness of old Paris but does not see it: where the book-binders \nof to-day sip\ntheir white wine of a warm afternoon, the obsession will show the revolutionary workmen of \nLes\nDieux ont Soif\n, and the two visions neutralise each other. Many a Frenchman has never been\nable to recapture his first delicious impression of Paris, after reading the volumes of Marquis de\nRochegude. Substitute Renan’s or Signor Ferrero’s mental habit of seeing the past as if it were\nthe present, of speaking of the Roman \nequites\n in terms of Wall Street, and everything will be\nclarified in an instant; but the something which differentiated an \neques\n from a banker, the spell\nattached to the distant past, will vanish.\nThe act of writing itself is productive of phantasms and is dangerous for the legitimate\nproduction of thought. Nobody ought to write who does not write with pleasure. But a number\nof professional writers are more conscious of an effort than of an enjoyment. Yet, self-\nexpression is a joy to everybody and is often found to be a unique relief. The reason why it is\nnot always so may be an imperfect command of the language used, or lack of real interest in the\nsubject treated, or some one of the causes enumerated in the foregoing pages. But it is chiefly a\nphantasm acquired in school days, the habit of thinking of the blank sheets lying under the one\nwe are writing upon, hating their breadth and length, and wondering how they can ever be all\nscribbled over.\nSome people imagine they have to write a book as, at fifteen, they had to write an essay,\nwhether they liked it or not. All the time they are at work on a chapter which ought to\nmonopolise their attention, they are anxious over future chapters still unborn \nand even\nunconceived, and the anxiety throws its shadow over the page just being written. As long as\nan author does not take the habit of “only writing his book,” as Joubert says, “when it is\nfinished in his mind,” or cannot honestly say, like Racine: “My tragedy is done, now I have\nonly to write the verses,” he will be a prey to the school-boy’s error. Nothing is as exciting as\nthe hunt after thoughts or facts intended to elucidate a question we think vital to us, and the\nenjoyment of writing when the hunt has been successful is an unparalleled reward for\nintellectual honesty. Leave only the slavish necessity or the meretricious desire for producing a\nbook and all the pleasure will be gone.\nSome people who think freely and charmingly in speaking seem to put their minds in a\nstrait-jacket the moment they begin to write. The wittiest man I have ever known, a French\naristocrat, used to produce drab letters over which he would plod for hours. A former colleague\nof mine, with an entirely literary background, showed, however, an interest in philosophy and,\nwithout having read any of the philosophers, would discourse on the fundamental issues with\nsurprising originality. “The Robinson Crusoe of philosophy,” another colleague used to call\nhim. This genius, every time he was compelled to write, relapsed into the state of mind in which\nhe used to be, years before, when going through examinations at the Sorbonne. His own\noriginality in thought or expression frightened him, and the results of his efforts, or I should\nsay probably tortures, were cold, elaborate pages recalling dons’ prefaces to dictionaries.\nMost writers are slaves to certain models of expression. \nMillions of sentences might be\ncurtailed of a final clause beginning with \nand\n which may be unnecessary as it is so often a mere\nrepetition or summary added solely to round off the sentence. The habit of using three verbs or\nthree adjectives where only one would suffice is almost as general. The average writer is not\nguided but coerced by a cheap rhythm as inseparable from him as the flute-player was from the\norator of antiquity. A man’s thought is hampered by these miserable toils.\nMore artistic writers cannot get rid of the notion that the language they use is fatally\ninferior to the classical style of past generations and, consequently, what they produce is\nbound to appear as a monument of decadence. They will not remember Goethe’s well-grounded\nremark that “the man who has been of his own time has really been of all times.” This thought\nwould open the door of the cage for them, but they go on knocking their heads against the\nbars.\nThe writer the most cramped by adventitious preoccupations, impairing even a beginning of\nsincerity, is the art critic. Compare Reynolds’ \nDiscourses\n, or Ruskin’s \nModern Painters\n, or, in\nFrench, the absolutely honest manual of de Piles with the articles on art appearing in most\nnewspapers. You will feel at once that the so-called critics only pretend to know what they are\nwriting about, and write about this negative quantity in an entirely artificial style. It is always a\nsurprise to me to see a forcible and direct writer of fiction use, in dealing with pictures, a cliché\nstyle which, in another man, would disgust him by its effete far-fetchedness. The cause is that\nthe novelist transmuted into an art \ncritic is not himself any more but another man, and the\ndouble consciousness is like a man’s effort to see two objects at the same time.\nO\nUR\n mind then, is like our eye: it must be single. Children, plain people, saintly people, artists, all\npeople possessed of a mastering purpose leaving no room for inferior preoccupations,\nreformers, apostles, leaders or aristocrats of all kinds, strike us by the directness of their\nintellectual vision. On the contrary, timid, weak, easily abashed people, people made to follow\nrather than to guide, sensitive people anxious about the impression they may produce, doubtful\nof the working of their own faculties and everlastingly trying to get reassured, have a fatal\ncapacity for letting in extraneous thoughts or mental parasites, which at first only obstruct but\ngradually obsess their own, hampering their vision, and ultimately leaving upon them that\nchronic sense of inadequacy which the term “inferiority complex” describes clearly, at all events\nto the present generation. Had Freud and Adler done nothing else but reveal the existence of\nsuch complexes and popularize the belief that proper treatme"

      "chapter_text": "nt can dissolve them, their\ninfluence ought to be regarded as beneficial.\nHOW MENTAL PARASITES ARE PRODUCED\na) \nImitation and gregariousness\nI said in the first part of this book that all children enjoy a few years of direct vision and\nimmediate impressions with which the most intense moments in their after-life remain\nconnected. This magical introduction to life can be compared to the charm of dawn in a big city:\nduring a brief spell everything seems as fresh as if it had just sprung into existence, but the\nrumours and bustle of the humdrum routine soon spoil even such a glorious background, and\nbanality sets in again.\nYoung children apprehend men and things without any intermediary, and their first\nimpression of them is so strong that they need not go back to the original source of impression.\nHence the mistake many parents make in refusing to admit that childhood is observant.\nTowards the tenth year things become different: children grow cognizant of their elders and\ncopy them. In a few months, sometimes in a few weeks, you can notice the change: a little man,\na little woman, grown-up gestures, mannerisms in pronunciation or phrasing, a faked interest in\ncertain things or a studied indifference to others appear; the expression of the face may not be\naffected, but it ceases to be spontaneous. Boys are more inclined to put on a rough, I-don’t-\ncare look,—sometimes worse, if they happen to be in coarse \nsurroundings; girls, on the\ncontrary, recall the thirteen-year-old brides whose mature conversation and artificial letters the\nseventeenth century used to take for granted. In many cases the observer fails to notice any\nconscious effort on the part of these aspiring grown-ups, but he cannot help being aware of a\nmarked decrease in spontaneity and charm. The ideas expressed, the attitude before life,\nsometimes even before grief, are uninteresting or unpleasant. Soul resilience is inferior to what\nit used to be. You will see boys of twelve or thirteen take stolidly their first experience of the\nocean, of the Canadian forests or of Rome or Egypt. Altogether these young beings who, up to\na quite recent day, had been like just-born clouds in the summer sky, feeling every breeze and\ncatching every reflection, now are all passivity. As the years glide on, if no noble passion helps\nthem to climb up to the hill brow again, they will look more and more like the multitude, lazily\nborrowing their thoughts, attitudes or language from the millions.\nWhat is to be done? It is the whole problem, for what can save a child from conformity\nwould also empower any one of us to produce thoughts of his own. Children have to be\neducated, but they have also to be left to educate themselves. In America it is in vain that\nparents are naturally inclined, and schools are more and more advised to allow children all the\nmental freedom they can use; conformity is too strongly established and it takes genius to\nescape from it. In France, and practically in all the old countries, imitation and a certain amount\nof insincerity are recommended. “Look at your father—do like father—think of others and not\nof yourself—let \nthem talk; they will love you if you do—do not always say all you think; you\nwill give offence and people will not like you.” There is no doubt that the model proposed for\nimitation is not Alceste but Philinte. And certainly Philinte is no fool; there is, well hidden in\nhim, a strain of irony which belongs only to a correct appreciation of mankind, but who can\ndeny that Alceste sees realities of a higher kind?\nIt is needless to say that, given what the world is, most children are more unfortunate than\nlucky in their surroundings. When they are poor, and feel badly dressed, badly brought up, and\ngenerally inferior, no matter how distinguished their intellects may be, they will be apt to be\nbrowbeaten into conformity. When they have stupid parents their questions, if they reveal any\noriginality, will be misunderstood and laughed at. It is not unheard-of either that religion, the\nmainspring of man’s rising above himself, is used by children’s elders as a method for crushing\nthem into conformity. Should they glimpse the fact that Christ and the saints did not conform,\nthey will pretty soon be made to realise that Christ and the saints are in a world apart, and good\nlittle children ought to be satisfied with doing what they are told to do. So the combination of\nthe natural instincts of man for imitation with the antipathy of the multitude against distinction,\nalmost inevitably grinds thought out to leave only the human gramophone.\nG\nREGARIOUSNESS\n is an instinct nearly akin to imitativeness and tending to develop it. Nowhere is it\nso apparent as in the United States. It may be that \nthe early pioneers brought with them the\naptitude for coöperation natural to the Anglo-Saxon race, but could not, for a long time, use it\nbecause of the comparative solitude in which they had to live; the consequence was that they\nwere predisposed to give it full play as soon as they had a chance. At all events, their\ndescendants are the most social people on the planet. French people in towns as well as in\nvillages, meet on Sundays, \nà la sortie de la grand’messe\n,—a distinctly social expression—but\nafter devoting ten minutes to questions complementary of the all-round scrutiny during the\nsermon, they retire to their \nquant à soi\n. Americans never have enough of one another. The Club\nis insufficient and has to be supplemented by midday luncheons, meetings or gatherings of all\nkinds, changes of officers or initiations, a reception to this or a memorial ceremony to that, stag\nor hen parties, to say nothing of concerts or the theatre which are only pretences; and, when\nnothing better offers, your social American will make the most of a hotel lobby or of the\n“smoker” which I should be ungrateful to mock, for I owe partly to it my knowledge of the\nAmerican man’s few faults and numerous qualities. The word “joiner,” which in England only\ndesignates a carpenter, means in America something purely American, as the sound of it,—as\naffectionate as sarcastic,—intimates.\nIt is well known that democracies produce uniformity. So do social miniature democracies.\nToo much individuality there would amount to not playing the game. When people form an\nassociation to protect common interests or foster common tastes, they must be expected to\ndevelop and encourage \nsimilarities. Attitudes are created, standpoints are emphasized, slogans\nare circulated which place a uniform imprint on people otherwise different. Dissenting where\nthere is so much that can be promoted only by union, would be worse than heretical and is\npractically impossible. Mental resistance is hardly less so. The waves which sweep over\ncommunities in times of great excitement or great calamities blind and bewilder all except the\nmost powerful. But the unseen continuous influence of the collective consciousness produces\nthe same results. I have been amused several times in the United States to find transplanted\ncountrymen of mine showing the same prejudice against negroes which prevails around them,\nbut of which they had no idea before emigrating. Here is no attitudinizing; gregariousness in all\nits degrees makes individual thinking, viz., the only real thinking, an insuperable difficulty.\nExamples in point could be adduced by the hundred. There is no more striking evidence of\nthe power of gregariousness than our attention to the divisions of time. The almanac and the\nclock reign supreme, and if they should disappear, civilisation as we know it would collapse.\nBut, while we are enabled by them to catch the train and to cash coupons, we are also their\nvictims. Not only do the active little seconds, in Maupassant’s phrase, nibble away our lives,\nbut, every year, another birthday falls on us like a rock, while the idea of age, as opposed to\nyouth, is a gigantic phantasm. Oscar Wilde says that the tragedy of old people is that they feel\nyoung; that is to say, they really feel as young people would if some wizardry made them\nimagine that they were old. There is no evil spell here, but only \nclocks, calendars, and \nA\n.\n D\n.\n’s on\nevery human document we touch. If these could be removed, things would change at once.\nThink of the delightful smile of the old Maryland negress whom you foolishly ask about her\nage. She has no age. But it costs a white man an effort amounting to genius to think away the\nfallacy of anniversaries.\nFallacies are every day pro"

      "chapter_text": "duced by ignorance or imperfect knowledge, and are instantly\ncirculated by the press. Their presence is a positive static. It makes thinking an impossibility\nuntil facts demonstrate that the apparently satisfactory notion was the result of inadequate\ninformation. People say that wars are inevitable till a League of Nations is founded; then they\nsay that peace can no longer be disturbed—until the failure of a Disarmament Conference\ncauses them to adopt another formula. A terse sentence is enthusiastically repeated by people\neager for some classification of the facts they witness. In a few days this sentence may be\ntransformed by the press into a slogan with a whole train of practical consequences behind it,\n—who can tell how many divorces have been brought about by the “pursuit of happiness”\nbeing mentioned as an elemental right in every American child’s text-book of the national\nhistory?\nb) \nEducation\nIs it not paradoxical, to the extent of being in bad taste, to speak of education as an obstacle\nand not as a help to thought? Is it not a fact that we can tell an educated man from another, not\nmerely by his manners and language, nor even by his information, but chiefly by his capacity\nfor resisting another \nman’s thought and defending his own views? Is it not true that we are\nnever surprised, when we meet a brilliant young man, to hear that he received his education at\none of the great English public schools, in a Paris \nlycée\n, or at a famous German or Polish\ngymnasium? Practically all philosophers, from Plato to Herbert Spencer, include an Art of\nThinking as well as a treatise on education in their philosophies, thereby implying that the two\nthings hang together. Horace Mann and Channing have produced in the United States a vast\nprogeny of men convinced that they can only raise the democracy of their country up to real\nconsciousness by education. The more a man thinks the better adapted he becomes to\nthinking, and education is nothing if it is not the methodical creation of the habit of thinking.\nPrecisely. Theoretically, education is a mental training aiming at greater intellectual\nelasticity, but the question is whether education does not often strain, instead of train, a mind.\nAre people generally satisfied with the education they have themselves received or see\ndispensed to their children? Are they not complaining about it all the time? It is remarkable that\nRabelais, Montaigne, Locke, Fénelon, Rousseau, as well as most of the numerous educators\nwho appeared during the nineteenth century, are \nagainst\n teachers. It may be because most of\nthese theorists never had any experience of that wild unbroken thing, a class, and imagine that\nwhat they now are they already were at twelve or fourteen. But it is chiefly because their\nsuperiority of intellect traces the shortcomings they are conscious of to bad methods of which\nthey were the victims in childhood. Teachers who—quite rightly—pooh-pooh reformers\npossessed of the foolish notion that a class is something else than an undisciplined young\ncolt, agree, nevertheless, that current methods of teaching are not good. Their controversies,\nthe tests and statistics they use to prove their points fill libraries. This being the fact, it is\ndifficult to resist the conclusion that education is not the Art of Thinking it ought to be.\nHowever, our point is that it can be worse than this. At an age when impressions are as\ndeep as they are insidious, uneducating education can produce mental parasites which, in time,\nare apt to result in inferiority complexes, or—a worse evil—can distort our whole outlook on\nlife. In every country education has its faults which it would take libraries to discuss. We must\nlimit ourselves. But it will not take long to show that education in the United States is too\nresolutely practical and leaves in the pupil’s mind the phantasm that culture is the privilege or\nthe amusement of a few; whereas education in France is precisely the reverse and places\nculture at such a height above action that the mere pleasures of the intellect seem immeasurably\nmore important than the practical duties of life. In both cases the capacity for right thinking is\nimpaired and a lifetime may be necessary to correct the initial mistake.\nEducation in America is still largely an education for pioneers or the sons of pioneers. This\naffirmation may surprise people living in the giant American cities, yet, even there, traces can\nstill be found of pioneers’ ways or pioneers’ ideas. The haphazard method of indicating the\nnames of the streets or the numbers of the houses, sometimes on a bit of plank rescued from\nsome wreckage, is an obvious \nsurvival. So are the solitary letter-boxes on the ends of sticks in\nthe most civilized parts of ultra-civilized Long Island. And I have no doubt that the notion so\nprevalent in the United States, and so fruitful of consequences, that women are scarce, is a relic\nof the days when women were really scarce and the emigrant who secured a wife crowed like a\nRoman youth bringing home a Sabine girl.\nThe American schools are mostly in the country, because primitive American life was a\ncountry life and the Pilgrims had seen the schools at home located in small towns or in open\nsuburban quarters like Westminster. And they are schools preëminently intended to develop\nphysical strength and its spiritual counterpart, will-power. Where the ancestors used to fell\ntrees in the vicinity of dangerous Indians, and with an eye on the ever-ready fowling-piece, the\nboys of Groton, St. Mark’s or St. Paul now develop superb bodies, a capacity for fending for\nthemselves, a passion for camp-life and an independent spirit to which the instinct for\ncoöperation adds rather than detracts. Sports are still, and often avowedly so, the essential part\nof the school life. I have not forgotten that, on my first introduction to one of the above\nestablishments, I was taken almost at once to the cupboard in which glorious baseballs rest on\nsilver rings, and respectfully made my ignorant salaam to these fetishes. School news in\nAmerica is sport news. Notre-Dame is a Catholic college, certainly, but it is that much less than\nit is a stronghold of football.\nTo be sure, athleticism is partly an art. Women frequently enhance it by elegance and, when\nthey do so, should they be as ignorant as Saxon princesses \nof the seventh century, they\nachieve an artistic result. But athleticism is not culture, and the complaints continually heard in\nAmerica about education arise from the impossibility of reconciling too much athleticism with\nculture. People often ask me: “Why do your young men seem to know so much more than ours,\nand use it so much more effectively in their conversation?” I am always surprised to see them\nstare when I reply: “Because school life in France means getting up at five o’clock and\nstudying till eight at night with only two hours recreation in between; because \ntravailler\n in\nFrench means to study, where as ‘to work’ in English applies to ‘work’ on the football field or\non the river. Our boys have mature brows but narrow chests; yours have broad shoulders but\nchildish expressions.”—“Is there no golden mean?”—“Yes, you will find it, and plenty of it, at\nSmith, Vassar, or Bryn Mawr, or in that perfect Thélème, the Princeton graduate school.” “Ah!\nyou do me good. Your boys are narrow-chested, eh?”—“Yes, till they have served a year or two\nin a regiment; we love to see them there, not merely because they are keeping up the national\nmilitarism and bloodthirstiness, but because the army gives them a chance of broadening their\nshoulders.”\nThe predominance of sports in schools, in the national life, in the press, not only crowds\nout what is or should be more important, but it creates an atmosphere in which these important\nthings are made to appear superfluous, or are even described in extremely disrespectful slang.\nWhat does seem important is a bustling, hustling life, with the excitement of getting in or out of\na scrimmage, beating \nsomebody or something, getting there. All of which is, within its limits, an\nexcellent way of looking at life, but is not culture. Angellier once asked a student which\ntragedies he preferred, Racine’s or Victor Hugo’s. “Hugo’s,” was the reply, “there is more life in\nthem.”—“More tussle,” Angellier mused, half to himself. Thoughtfulness, which is the highest\nform of life, is reconcilable with tussle only in a deep biological sense which is too subtle for\nthis practical book to ent"

The plain fact is that the boy who shows the greatest activity\nor initiative on the game field is not by any means always the one who asks the most intelligent\nquestions. Frequently he asks no questions at all, and his attitude is the “Tell us” which\nMadame de Maintenon used to hold up to contempt to the Saint-Cyr girls and which some\nAmerican college professors have told me is likely to be retranslated in American college\nEnglish into the blunt: “It’s \nyour\n job to tell us.” A school is a place through which you have to\npass before entering life, but where the teaching proper does not prepare you for life. What is\ncalled culture is in danger of being regarded, in such an environment, as a specialty and not as\nan indispensable requisite. Scholarship might be calculus. This accounts for the fact that the\nAmerican public at large, which cannot bear the idea of foreign superiority in anything else,\ndoes not care a fig if it is beaten in the field of thought or of the arts. Who worries if one’s\nneighbor is better than one’s self at weighing the planets? To what extent this indifference is\ncarried can be measured from the fact that an American newspaper \nnever\n tells its readers\nwhether the speech it reports was a good speech or not. Oratory is a specialty; \nonly facts\ninterest the millions. Yet, Americans love eloquence.\nI have often amused myself by imagining Cicero suddenly appearing in America and being\ninterviewed at the Hotel Brevoort by two newspaper men, one French or British, full of school\nreminiscences and beyond himself with excitement at the thought of seeing the ORATOR; the\nother, an American, rehearsing questions concerning prohibition or spiritualism, and really\nwondering if the Acheron is now crossed by motor-boat, or whether the Elysian Fields are\nproperly gridironed.\nTo sum up: the notion of culture is too often dimmed in the American mind by the\nphantasm, uselessness; and thought, with such an impediment, is difficult indeed.\nHas it always been so? Is this a part of the American idiosyncrasy which cannot be\nmodified? Anybody who has disturbed the files of early American newspapers or reviews does\nnot hesitate to give this question a negative answer. America is constantly spoken of as a\nyoung nation or a nation of young people. I used to be on my guard against this formula which\nI thought might be only an extensible lid covering all boxes. Gradually I have come to the\nconclusion that it is largely true. But it is true only of modern America. Early America was not\nyoung; it was quite mature. Not one of the men who signed the Declaration of Independence\nwould have struck a member of the contemporary English Parliament as unduly young. The\ncontrary would probably have been the fact. But not one of those men could appear on the\ncampus of one of the modern successors of their Pennsylvania, Virginia \nor Maryland schools\nwithout shrugging his shoulders at the seriousness with which mere play is now taken.\nAmerica has grown young during the latter part of her career, but this youthful America is\nsomething different from the historic United States. The American élite knows and deplores\nthis. The extraordinary effort towards the diffusion of education seen everywhere in America is\nthe vital reaction of a society feeling itself threatened in its essentials. But the resistance of the\nunwieldy mass, so far, is too great. The requirements of this mass still fashion the educational\nmethods instead of the mass being fashioned by them, and no amount of testing, trying, or\ntheorizing has, as yet, been able to change this preposterous situation. The mass wants easy\nmethods, and so the methods are easy. It wants immediate practical results, and practicality is\nconsidered first.\nEasy methods seem to be a dogma with Americanizers. Easy is the word one hears all the\ntime in connection with the art of teaching. I wrote, a few years ago, a school-book which was\npublished in New York under the title \nFrench Grammar Made Clear\n. The book has been\nmisquoted, scores of times, as \nFrench Grammar Made Easy\n.\nFrench grammar cannot be made easy. Nor can Latin grammar. It can be made, and ought to\nbe made, clear and interesting. But no attempt at brightening it with Alma-Tadema pictures can\nconjure away the declensions, conjugations and modes. The best psychology is to persuade\nthe pupil that hundreds and thousands of not very intelligent people before him have\nconquered those dry beginnings by mere perseverance. In fact, little peasants trained \nfor the\npriesthood by plain country \ncurés\n who never dream of calling themselves scholars constantly\nmaster Latin morphology in three or four months. More than once I have seen the neighboring\nclergyman drop in during the lesson and play with the \npetit latiniste\n as the Tuileries\nenchanteur\n plays with the sparrows. Seldom does the red-faced little fellow miss a crumb of the\ncases or tenses slyly flung at him. No inferiority complex with regard to mere words has been\nplanted in him. He does not think of his declensions as something difficult or something easy,\nbut as something which everybody has to learn and does learn.\nOn the other hand, read the directions issued by the New York Board of Education\nconcerning the teaching of elementary Latin. The person who drew them up was evidently full\nof the notion that everybody must think Latin morphology as uninviting as the cuneiforms, and\nall that can be done is to take it in easy, i. e., minute instalments. Several months are supposed\nto be necessary to master the first three declensions; then a long rest is given to the student as\nif to prepare him for a final and much worse spurt; then the last two declensions are tackled or, I\nshould say, played with.\nWhat psychological background is likely to be created by this nerveless method? Evidently\na notion that the Latin declensions are a nightmare, but \ndies\n and \ncornu\n are more formidable\nthan the other three. My own old teacher, who had no idea of any directions but who\npossessed a tradition, said to us in perfect good faith: “\nDies\n and \ncornu\n being simplicity itself,\nyou shall learn these two declensions, instead of one, for next time.” The result \nwas that even\ndunces were not afraid of the Latin declensions. Ask most American boys and girls who have\ngone through a classical course, and you will find that Latin morphology is as vague in their\nminds as badly taught Greek is in Europe. People in America remember being put through a\nbook or two of Cæsar, a book or two of Virgil, an oration or two of Cicero, but their idea of Latin\nas a language is that it is a University specialty, as Sanskrit appears to most people, i. e.,\nsomething you are not expected to know. My surprise was great when I saw an American poet\nwho shows no small pretensions to scholarship entitling one of his poems \nPueribus\n! Such are\nthe results produced by making Latin easy.\nThe real result is that four, five or six years of so-called study only leave the impression that\n“nobody knows Latin; nobody can know it.” A deeper and more dangerous one is that giving\ntime to such a hopeless task is an absurdity. The suspicion that to compel young American\ncitizens to go through an entirely useless routine is absurd and even immoral is not far. Try to\nplay the Tuileries \nenchanteur’s\n game with one of these school boys. You will read a great deal\nin the bored or incredulous expression; either an inferiority complex is there, working its usual\ndamage, or it has already been kicked out, along with ancient wisdom, by a young barbarian\nwho refuses to be made a fool of.\nUtilitarianism in education is as disastrous to culture as so-called easy methods are to\nscholarship. The preference for scientific branches which can be turned to immediate account is\nof course a manifestation of the utilitarian spirit. So is the \npurely practical teaching of modern\nlanguages prevalent in most schools. So is the absence of all philosophical teaching in the\nHigh Schools.\nBut more striking is the way in which apparently disinterested literary efforts are turned to\nmere utility. I was quite impressed the first few times I was shown a school paper, and realized\nthat a staff of boys under a boy editor was responsible for what is comparatively excellent stuff.\nIt was only by degrees that—in spite of the poems which Anglo-Saxon boys or girls produce\nwith more facility than French students—I realised that here was, not a literary, but a\nnewspaper training.

      "chapter_text": "is a good newspaper but that is damning praise, for\na good newspaper is not literary and a school newspaper ought to be preëminently that. The\neditor ought to have in mind Addison, Cobbett or Bernard Shaw when he writes an essay; as a\nmatter of fact he does not even think of Mr. Mencken’s imitators: the little home paper is his\nstandard of excellence. If Addison were imitated the results would be poor but literary; as it is,\nthe results are not literature, even if they seem fair.\nThe same can be said of the short stories, one-act plays or scenarios produced in the\nFiction or Drama schools of many an American college. The teaching is first-rate, the methods\nare far more thorough than those used in the classical courses, the wish to succeed and the\neffort towards success cannot be questioned. What are the results? Undoubtedly superior in\ncraftsmanship to, say \nWuthering Heights\n. The terseness, the rapidity, the turn of the wrist, the\nbalance, impress and almost intimidate you. In time you discover that these qualities \nare the\naccompaniment, or even the creation, of an ardent desire to produce a “marketable” article.\nThen you understand why the more you read of those excellently manufactured stories the less\nclaim they seem to have to be called literature. Literature is not so clever. It wrestles with life\nand often gets beaten, but the struggle compels our homage. Anybody who has received a\nliterary education feels this; but if education goes over to the enemy and begins to teach\ncommercial methods, the minds, even of the \nélite\n, will be invaded by the parasite of utility at all\ncosts, and the power of thinking in terms of beauty will lose in consequence.\nThe American boy leaves school with a more or less definite idea that what is called culture\nis a luxury, that is to say a superfluity. He has not been taught to view Latin as an artistic\nmosaic, or English composition as an effort to rise above himself. His imagination has been\ndiscouraged rather than cultivated. He is far inferior, in cultural respect, to the Americans of\neighty years ago.\nI\nN\n absolute opposition, French schools turn out young people convinced that nothing, except\nthe attainments of intellect, has much right to respect. Educated French men and women, with\nwhom deep spiritual realities do not act as a counterweight, find it difficult to take a practical\nview of life because of a phantasm created during their formative years: the self-sufficiency of\nthe brain.\nNine out of ten French schools are located in towns. The most famous ones are in Paris.\nMany of them still use ancient monastic buildings as different as can be from the château-like\nschools of America, \nand these medieval monuments are, in many cases, the successors of\nGallo-Roman schools. A tradition of culture handed down through many centuries clings to\nthese grey walls, but the very sight of the cramped court-yards shut in between tall houses\nbetrays a disregard, nay a complete ignorance, of bodily requirements.\nMany Frenchmen still alive knew no other exercise in their school days than the dismal\ncircuitous walk allowed to prisoners in penitentiaries, and twice a week the melancholy walk\nthrough the suburbs and back. The early recollections of such writers as Taine, Daudet or\nBourget are full of self-pity. But they admit that, while their bodies were inactive, their minds\nwere busy: these poor boys’ vitality was kept up by the excitement of discovery in thought or\nexpression and the clash of ideas, which make French conversation something like an\nadventure.\nTo-day the \nlycéen\n goes regularly to the “gym,” and on Sundays or Thursdays he actually\nhas a chance of playing football or tennis. But his daily routine still shows two hours given to\nplay as against eleven given to study, and the French champion on the game field, if he\nhappens to be dull elsewhere, will be an object of amused wonderment rather than of\nadmiration.\nSchool in France does not mean boys, it means teachers and books. For centuries the\nbooks were the Latin and Greek classics taught in order to be spoken, or at all events written, as\nnaturally as the student’s mother tongue. Little else was drawn attention to, but the characters\nof ancient history became familiar, and the main lines of the \nscience of politics were inferred,\neven when they were not taught.\nTo-day literature has routed all its rivals, even science, no matter how idolized, and it is so\nin schools as it is in life. Greek, Latin and French classics stand on the school-boy’s desk\nbeside scientific books and manuals of history. But the one book to which he will naturally\nrevert, the one which his hand instinctively seeks at vacant moments, is his Lanson or his\nDesgranges, the manual of literary history. He may have a turn for mathematics and know he\nmust face years of severe effort before he can get admission to the Ecole Polytechnique, but\nliterary history will be no less attractive to him.\nWhat does he get out of this panorama of intellectual development elsewhere almost\nexclusively reserved for grown-up specialists? A mixture of good and bad. He certainly acquires\na philosophical bent by noticing the concatenation of ideas, systems or sentimental reactions\nwhich make up the history of literature: his mind becomes used to the logic of facts, and, year\nafter year, grows more enamoured of the lucidity resulting from the vision of causes and effects.\nBut, long before he has had time to do more than take a cursory view of the great monuments of\nliterature, he has been given general ideas about them. He has acquired the terrible French\ncraving for summing up complex realities in one formula, and too often he has grown\naccustomed to the semi-philosophical jargon of the literary historian. If he is mentally strong,\nhis vocabulary will be helpful; if he is not, the learned words and apparently illuminating fore-\nshortenings will only give him \na cheap superiority over people who have not had his training.\nThey will give him something even worse: insincerity. For, in his heart, he knows that he says a\ngreat deal for which he would be unable to give chapter and verse.\nEven more frequent is the French boy’s delight in reading about a writer’s personal\ndevelopment. The Romanticists, especially, from Rousseau to Loti, ravish his soul. The\npossibility of living a life rich in emotion and made sublime by inspiration seems to him the one\ndesirable goal. Read Fromentin’s novel, \nDominique\n, if you wish to realise the havoc wrought\nby such a huge obstacle placed at the outset on the path to right and sensible thinking.\nIs this exaggeration never corrected by French teachers? you ask. A French teacher, in Paris\nespecially, is unlikely to dispel this fallacy, for he himself is a prey to it. Count the masters in\nEnglish and especially in American schools, who publish books. How can they, since when\nthey are not with the boys, teaching, they are with them playing? A French teacher is a man\nwho has written, is writing, or wants to write a book, quite possibly a novel or a play, and to\nwhom literary renown is the one glory worth working for. His example, as well as the point of\nview he cannot help expressing, contributes to plant ever deeper in his boys’ imaginations the\nphantasm that literary men and women are the real heroes. The word genius is repeated in\nFrench schools till the pupils cannot escape from the double conviction that it is the one thing\nworth having and that they will never possess it.\nLiving incarnations of genius the French boy eagerly seeks. Sooner or later he will\nBoswellize one \nof his own discovering. In the meantime he delivers himself up to the influence\nof his teacher, sometimes of the top boy, a French institution of which no Steerforth can give an\nidea. I do not think that the scornful French vocabulary cruelly distinguishing between the \ntête\nof a class and its \nqueue\n exists in any other language. It predisposes the wretched \nqueue\n to\nhumble subservience to what is wrongly supposed to be superior and diminishes its self-\nrespect. In other countries sporting achievements, daring, or some promise of business sense\nor executive ability will give those so-called inferior boys a feeling of strength which saves\nthem; but in French schools intellectual superiority is unchallenged, and the corresponding\ninferiority complex is at liberty to fill the soul it has once invaded.\nPractical consequences in the life of the nation itself are only too visible.

The young\nman was astonished and I was a little anxious about his next reaction, for earnestness does not\nflourish in the vicinity of brilliance.\nForeigners who make in France a stay of sufficient duration to be personally affected by the\nnumerous shortcomings in the official life of the nation are invariably puzzled. How can such\nintelligent people put up with such absurdities? they ask. In time they give themselves some\nsort of an answer. I have not forgotten the verdict which, when I first visited the United States,\nin 1908, a famous American politician passed in my presence. “The French are bright,” he said,\n“but they are not intelligent.” It was a comfort to reflect that the word “bright” in American-\nEnglish is marvellously extensible, but I felt the sting of truth. Abuses are tolerated by the\nFrench provided they can laugh, or make cynical remarks about them. The press campaigns, the\nenlightenment drives which are perseveringly carried on in the United States are impossible in\nFrance.\nThe toleration by the French of their politicians is of the same order and arises from the\nsame feeling of superiority of ideas to mere contingencies. Politicians are despised as roguish\nvalets are by indolent masters. The Scandinavian idea of compelling them to be trustees for the\ncommunity, or of expecting tangible results from their presence on the boards of the national\nadministration, never occurs to the average Frenchman. Life, he thinks, is not very hard, after\nall, even if governments do \nnot try to make it perfect. Good-humoured contempt is reform\nenough.\nPreference for ideas, especially general ideas allowing simplified visions, is a French trait,\neven when terrible consequences may be the result. An Englishman, practically all the time, an\nAmerican, in most cases, will know when positive danger to their country, and consequently to\nthemselves, is imminent, and promptly cease discussing ideas to see to practical measures. To\ndance on a volcano is a decidedly French phrase describing a French attitude. Ideas count\nmore in France than facts, and as long as education is at one with the national bias to prefer the\nart of living to the struggle for life, this one-sided view will go on.\nL\nET\n us now remember our little boy of nine or ten, so receptive that great poets envy him, and\nso full of searching curiosity that philosophy cannot keep up with his questions. What\nbecomes of him when he leaves school? In America a husky young chap, all muscles, heart and\nwishes; in France a slender young man, all brain, totally unprepared for life, apt to mistake ideas\nfor realities and words for ideas. Both have received their education, both have had their\nchance. The American will always remain ill-equipped, full of intellectual gaps, uncertain\nbetween confidence and timidity and showing it; the Frenchman, if he is not saved by his\nreligion, by patriotism or by some other uplift, will be largely artificial. Both men will think the\nthoughts of their environment, not their own, and education, which is nothing if it is not an\napplied Art of Thinking for one's self, will be to blame for this result.\n\n2. THOUGHT WEAKENED BY LIFE\na) \nThe Thinker’s Life\nPeople are wont to praise life as the great educator. In fact, nobody can deny that life is a\nsuccession of lessons enforced by immediate reward, or, oftener, by immediate chastisement,\nwhich cannot pass unnoticed. Our successes and our failures create in us an instinct for safety\nwhich we decorate with the names of experience or wisdom. It is also a fact that action, when it\nis of certain quality and calls forth our best energies, acts upon us as our noblest experiences\nmay, and we look back to the few years or months during which the effort lasted with a\nnostalgic yearning. To some men the word “Front” means the place with the sublimely vague\nname where their soul was at its fullest. . . . On this high level, action not only can help thought,\nbut it produces it with a continuity which raises it to the height of creativeness.\nHowever, these are rare experiences, and it cannot be denied that daily life, the apparently\ntremendous effort of one thousand million mortals repeated day after day, adds little or no\nthought to the common capital while, on the contrary, it wears out the individual’s thinking\ncapacity. Plato says: “Experience takes away more than it adds; young people are nearer ideas\nthan old men.” Young saints are not scarce, an old one is a delightful exception. \nWe cannot\ndissociate solitude, freedom and leisure from our concept of a life dedicated to thought:\nSpinoza in his one room where the carefully chosen monotony of his manual work acted on him\nas the monastic routine act on a Benedictine scholar; Descartes leaving Paris for a quiet suburb\nof far-away Hague; Bossuet retreating like a hermit to the cabin at the end of his garden;\nPasteur or Edison in their inviolate laboratories; learned monks in their convents; sages in the\nshady seclusion of a Massachusetts village; artists everlastingly trying to form colonies\nuniquely dedicated to disinterested work: all show us pictures of the kind of existence we\nimagine as naturally favourable to thought. The social life they conjure up is reduced to a\nminimum. It is little more than a soft accompaniment to the working of the mind, as the hum of\nthe spinning-wheel is to Marguerite’s reverie. We must feel some life going on near us, and\neven an occasional dip into exaggerated activity is a tonic, but social intercourse should never\nbe more exacting than that which we have with the watchman protecting our nights.\nb) \nNon-thinking Lives\nOver against the calmness, security and concentration of the life of a Spinoza, set the\nexistence of most people. They speak of themselves, rich or poor, as driven slaves, drudges,\nwho “cannot call their souls their own.”\nMillions are oppressed by manual work, either because there is too much of it, or because\nthe life has been taken out of it by standardization, or because its alternate praising up or\ndepreciation by so-called labor leaders replaces their natural attachment to their occupation by\nuncertainty and sometimes \nhatred. Many hundreds of thousands who would feel inclined to\nthink highly of their work and realize its dignity cannot indulge the tendency because of the\ninsecurity in which they live. When you see the traces of untimely weariness on a man’s face,\nin nine cases out of ten, you may be sure that over-work is not to be blamed; what is to be\nblamed is the anxiety of not having any work to do; that has sunk the eye and pinched the\nmouth. Literary or artistic people with a vocation and no means are the classical instance and\nwell deserve to be. After they become famous their historians are apt to repeat the thoughtless\nand heartless saw that it is good for writers and artists to be a little hungry. The fact is that\nwealth is injurious to art, but artists cannot live without a certain amount of success. Failure\nand anxiety have never been known to elicit the best from a man’s faculties. Too often they\nhave done the reverse. The man seeks refuge in misanthropy or in dissipation. If he tries the\nusual path to success, endeavours to make himself agreeable or popular, curries favour with\nrich or influential people, he loses his dignity, and the quality of his thinking deteriorates\nsimultaneously.\nDriven, slaves, and drudges are also the rich. Preachers and moralists are apt to say that\nrich people are less happy, have more cares than the poor. I heard a bearded Capuchin once say\nthat golden crosses were heavier than wooden"

Golden crosses large enough for one to be crucified\nupon do not exist; if they did they could be sold for big sums and the price of them given to\ncharities. Rich people have fewer \ncares than poor ones—that is the sober truth—but they are\ndriven by their fellow men and women, drudges to organized nothingness, and slaves to\namusements. Their endless complaint is that they never have any time and are glad\noccasionally to be sick, in order to steal a little rest. Yet, they dread solitude and their one\nantonym for amusement is boredom. Travelling teaches them something of the outside\nappearance of the world, and social life gives the best gifted of them a store of facts—though it\nis surprising to notice how little they know about human nature. But time for thought they have\nnot, a taste for serious conversation or serious books they seldom have or soon lose. They live\non their most elementary instincts, seeking happiness in pleasure, affairs, or power.\nWhatever they do, they try to sell oftener than they buy, not realizing that in the life of\nsentiment egotism gives us the shadow for the substance. Soon their scale of values is\nfalsified, immediate fruition taking precedence over unsuspected deeper joys. A worldling is\npreëminently a person whose judgment is not right, because his mind is full of inferior images\nand tyrannical phantasms. And gregariousness is the most powerful tyrant in such lives.\nPeople, still more people! Often distinguished men or women appear in the drawing-room or at\nthe dinner-table. But of what use are they beyond the petty satisfaction of saying: “Oh! I know\nhim”? Who listens to them? Who helps the hostess in her effort to give the lion a chance?\nWho wishes to make the most of a rare intellect? On two occasions I saw Cardinal Mercier\npitifully wasted. Americans cannot realize how many chances for mental improvement \nthey lose\nby their inveterate habit of keeping up six conversations when there are twelve people in the\nroom.\nTo sum up, the child notices grown-ups and begins to think their thoughts; he goes to\nschool, and too often education imposes other people’s thoughts upon him instead of helping\nhim to go back to his own; once out of school, he makes money, or arrives, or amuses himself;\nthere is no question of thinking any more, unless we call thinking using one’s mind to attain\npractical ends. Altogether, life does just the reverse of what it is supposed to do; it travels\naway from thought, and the process begins when we are ten years old.\nc) \nThe Great Waste\nReading is supposed to help thinking; a man who reads simply borrows another man’s\nthoughts, and this means a craving for thinking. A scarcity of books is understood to amount\nto intellectual fasting. Reading, Bacon says, makes a full man; and Dangeau, dining with Louis\nXIV, once answered a question of the King with the sentence: “Reading does to my mind what\nyour Majesty’s partridges do to my cheeks.”\nBut there is reading and reading. The word, like “intelligent,” like “wit,” has been in service\na long time and its fringe has gradually become different from what it used to be. Reading, in its\nearliest stage, cannot have been remote from a magical or a hieratic process and was part of a\nrite. Our way of reading by just running our eye quickly along a page of type would have\nsurprised and shocked the Ancients. Few people, in antiquity, knew how to read, and few\npossessed the bricks, stones or rolls \nnecessary for reading. So, like Herodotus at the Olympic\ngames, they were expected to impart to their less fortunate brethren something of the treasure\nin their hands. Reading out loud seems to have been the rule. It must long have been the\ncustom even in private reading, and the rustic who moves his lips as he reads is keeping up a\ntradition. Candace’s eunuch, who was reading Isaiah on the Gaza road, would not have been\noverheard by Philip had he not read his book aloud. A biographer of Saint Ambrose also tells\nus that this learned archbishop was sorely tried in old age by having to renounce reading,\n“because his throat was affected.” So people would only take up a book for a purpose and with\na gravity now reserved for reading the Bible or documents of a semi-sacred character. The\nwhole soul was in requisition and its whole power, undiminished by distraction or by\nphantasms, was applied to the high task. Who can doubt that reading, under such conditions,\nmust be effective? Legouvé, a mere man of the world, once beat Cousin, a philosopher and a\nscholar, in the discussion of a doubtful passage of La Fontaine. Cousin asked the reason, and\nthe other man said: “I always read La Fontaine out loud whereas you read the \nFables\n as most\npeople do; my voice tells me when there is a danger of misinterpreting a line.”\nSo the quality of reading was excellent.\nThe quality of what was read was as good. Books were few and costly and there was no\nidea of accumulating them indiscriminately. Even the invention of printing did not at first\nmodify the composition of libraries: religious books, poets and philosophers were the\nfoundation; light reading was \nprovided by Homer or by the historians. The libraries of Kings\nand those of the rich monasteries seldom counted more than a few thousand volumes.\nIndividual collections were naturally smaller. Spinoza possessed less than sixty volumes, of\nwhich we have a list. A hundred years later Kant collected three hundred, but half of this\nnumber were narratives of travel, for Kant had a frivolous side.\nPeople, from necessity, as well as from a traditional choice, limited themselves to what we\ncall to-day the classics but in those days were simply called good books. They were mostly\nwritten in difficult languages which it was not enough to play with, as our students do to-day,\nbut which must be mastered. Latin had to be spoken, and even Greek was still used by Petavius\nwhen he defended his thesis at the age of twenty-four. The \nThesaurus Linguæ Græcæ\n of\nStephanus is full of echoes of Greek conversations held in the printer’s backshop. The\nscholarship of those days tackled everything with a decision which was the very negation of\nan inferiority complex. If you studied one volume, you knew the sacred writings of the Christian\nreligion; if you went through the few tomes of Aquinas, you knew theology; if you annexed the\nPandects\n you knew law. The effort was made by thousands who thought no more of it than a\nmodern apprentice to an electrician thinks of his hourly approach to the mastery of his trade.\nEvery minute counted.\nIt is not surprising, therefore, that many men were supposed and supposed themselves to\nbe in possession of practically all the knowledge of their day—a belief destructive of all\nphantasms. It is not surprising either that men whom we should call \nyoung and immature were\nregarded with unalloyed respect. We now speak of men of forty-eight as young. This is a\npurely modern notion bred of the fact that wisdom has now to be forced upon us. The men of\nthe French Revolution were never derided on account of their youth, as the men of the\nCommune, eighty years later, were. Guy-Patin, telling in 1660, the amusing story of the feud\nbetween the physicians and the surgeons, relates that the former were defended by M. Lenglet,\nprofessor of rhetoric in the Collège du Plessis, and rector of the University. He subjoins that\nthis remarkable orator was a native of Beauvais and twenty-six years of age, but he attaches no\nmore importance to one particular than to the other. A man of twenty-six was a man and not a\nboy, as we foolishly imagine and openly say, to the detriment of the race by the diffusion of a\ndangerous phantasm. If he began early enough, worked hard enough, and worked under the\nbest conditions, a man of the pre-scientific periods felt himself thoroughly equipped before he\nwas twenty-five.\nTo-day printing has gone mad and the world is in danger of being submerged by the ocean\nof books. Eleven thousand volumes are annually published in France alone to about seventy\nunder Louis XIV. And who can think, without feeling dizzy and sick, of the billions of words\ndeluging every Sunday morning the American towns? “Make your own choice!” the guilty\neditors would say. “Know what you want! We have it ready for you.” A wise counsel, indeed,\nfor the whole Art of Thinking is in it, but only the man who knows how to think can follow it.\nThe others, millions of "

In such a confusion, phantasms and inferiority complexes germinate like\nmicrobes in an active solution. The worst of them is probably the notion that one cannot have\nan opinion about every book, yet one must seem to have one. This gives a free field, and\nsecures a multitude of slaves to slogans. People pretend they have read what they have not\nread and repeat anyhow somebody else’s judgment. Nothing, of course, can be so destructive\nof thought and of the capacity for thinking. No such lever can wrench a man from out of his\nown soul.\nWhen people do read, what do they read? Certainly not Aquinas or the \nPandects\n. Many\npretend to read the Bible, but of how few it is true! Three or four in a thousand read poets: they\nare regarded with the same surprise—not unmixed with mistrust—with which the poets\nthemselves are considered. What is produced by the gross, what is constantly forced on our\nattention, trumpeted by publicity and magnified by criticism is fiction. Novels fill the\nbookshops and suffocate our bookshelves. What people read in the country where there is a\nlittle time to read are novels; what people pretend to read or skim through in town where there\nnever is any time are novels. And the novels are not those great works of fiction which, since\nthe sixteenth century, have added to our knowledge of mankind, or even their modern\nsuccessors of such fame that we cannot ignore them; they are, and the readers know they are,\npure and simple trash, the very titles of which will be forgotten in a week. “What are you\nreading?” I once asked an English friend, a woman \nof high character and no mean achievements\n—“Novel.”—“Whom is it by?”—“Don’t know.” (\nSemi-guilty, semi-apologetic little laugh.\n)\nNovels are read to kill time—the most sacrilegious phrase in modern languages. And the\nword “read,” since the people of the past three or four generations have been weakened to\ndeath by fiction, not only has lost its former majesty but has changed its very meaning. It is\nnow mentioned, along with smoking and playing cards, as a semi-physical relaxation; the\nnotion of a definite purpose in giving one’s self up to it is excluded. The real purpose hidden\nunder the gregarious act of reading is NOT TO THINK.\nThis is quite plainly visible when the time-killer is using periodicals. I do not mean the\nreviews or even the magazines. Anybody who, in default of books, has lighted in the country\non a forgotten nest of the \nRevue des Deux Mondes\n, or \nThe Atlantic Monthly\n, or even of \nThe\nSaturday Evening Post\n must have realized how much substantial food is canned in those\napparently ephemeral objects. Moreover, I shall have a chance in the third part of this volume\nto draw attention to the capacity of the daily newspaper to transform itself into a first-rate\ninstrument of thought. But it requires a special need, a special gift, or a special education to\nraise it up to that level. In most cases the newspaper is not read at all or is barely glanced at.\nOften it is still neatly folded up late in the afternoon until the maids feel they must give it a\nchance. Or the way in which it lies over an armchair is revelatory of the kind of attention it has\nbeen vouchsafed.\nThe true measure of its possibilities as a thought-weakener \nis taken when we watch an\naverage newspaper reader in the train. I remember once observing a man on the other side of\nthe aisle between Philadelphia and New York. We both had the \nPhiladelphia Ledger\n across our\nknees. I made a few red marks on my copy and then began to notice the gentleman. He read the\naccount of the swimming feat accomplished by some lady in the Hudson River. This was a\nstory of some length which had to be continued on page 6, column 3. But the gentleman was\nunequal to the effort of turning three big sheets over; he was reading, not exerting himself.\nSo, leaving the grease-coated nymph, he went on to the cross-examination of the Pig\nWoman in the New Jersey case, and, dazed by the fusillade of irrelevant questions which the\nPig Woman herself described in an immortal sentence as “talk, talk, chatter, chatter,” he began\nalternately to fidget and yawn, but he never skipped a line. The whole mortal newspaper was\nread through in that way, on the brim of disgust or sleepiness, with occasional flickers of\nenergy accompanied by a stiffening of the bust and a falcon glance at nothing through the\nwindow. In time the swimming lady reappeared in a corner, and the Pig Woman filled serried\ncolumns again, and there was a presidential message to Congress, and editorials, and news of\nthe corn market, and shipping and sporting intelligence. All this was read on the same level,\nand with the same unfathomable disinterestedness till we neared the tunnel. Then the\ngentleman, all fagged and faint, showed a marvellous reflex; he flung down the crumpled\nsheets, jumped to his feet and felt for his cigarettes. He had been reading.\nImagine the effects, in the long run, of a so-called intellectual process which consists in\npresenting to the mind a score of different objects in none of which any real interest is taken. If\nwe remember that our most serious attempt at mastering what we read is constantly hindered by\nadventitious images which we call distractions, leaving possibly two thirds of our\nconsciousness available for what we read, we shall have little doubt that reading, as practised\nby most people, is nothing but a method of not thinking. Let this go on for several years and\nthe brain will become what is properly termed jellified. Now, this goes on through a whole\nlifetime with the majority of men and women. They leave school or college at eighteen or\ntwenty-two. At that stage academic necessities have compelled them to read mostly serious\nbooks and to read them seriously. As far as education goes they were going in the right\ndirection. The first thing the world and its so-called civilisation do for them is to persuade them\nthat masterpieces are tedious, text-books or encyclopædias boresome, whereas light literature\ngoes along with freedom. Henceforth reading will be one of the destructive forces, arrayed\nagainst them. The newspaper, above all, will bewilder them by its desultoriness or weaken them\ninto faint-hearted common scepticism by its contradictions. They will be the toy of\nirresponsible head-liners.\nHere let me conjure up, only for an instant, the wistful face of the man immersed in\nbusiness, thinking of intellectual culture as of a Paradise Lost, and able at most to devote half\nan hour a day to religious or philosophical reading, or occasionally to a poet worth the name.\nHow noble and pathetic this \nvisage looks! How we bow to the often marvellous results\nproduced by the thirty minutes set aside for thought! But how rarely we encounter the almost\nheroic person who will save himself from annihilation whereas millions happily plunge into it.\nThe idea of such a thing as printing contributing to such a result is well-nigh unbearable.\nAnother waste—so well known and unfortunately so inevitable that it is useless to say\nmore than a word about it—is conversation. “Conference makes a ready man,” Bacon said.\nReady for what? The Ancients, like most Orientals to-day, seem to have spoken only when they\nhad something to say, and their scale of valuing what was worth saying and what was not,\nappears to have been the same as that of their best writers. Hence the pithiness of their\nspeeches. When a writer, not even of the highest order,—say Mr. Galsworthy—hits upon the\ndevice of contracting his dialogues to the two or three brief sentences with which impassioned\npeople will wind up a conversation, he produces an unexpectedly powerful effect.\nNow, think of the twaddle in the “smoker,” of the empty boyish tongue-wagging in club-\nhouses, of the \nrisqué\n gossip gilt over with a dash of wit in French salons, or of the\ncorresponding Anglo-Saxon delight in stale anecdotes! What a mockery to repeat that speech\nis the instrument of thought when it has become the mere satisfaction of a physical craving! If\nBacon should rewrite, in the light of modern facts, the famous sentences from which I was\nquoting above, he would say that reading despoils a man of his personality and conference\nshows that he has lost it.\nThe general conclusion of this Part II can only be melancholy. Man is born without\nphantasms or inferiority complexes and with a capacity for observing and garnering thought-\nfos"

      "chapter_text": "elfish or immoral, few really prefer it, but\nalmost everybody thinks of it with pleasure. The name has a beautiful sound which even the\nhackneyed Latin jingle: \no beata solitudo, o sola beatitudo!\n has not succeeded in spoiling, and\nthe idea is enchanting. We envy Madame de Sévigné leaving the Court and her friends for the\nretirement of her Breton manor, Bossuet or Meredith alone in their hidden cottages at the end of\nthe garden, Rousseau in his forest, Silvio Pellico in his prison, Alain Gerbault on his ocean-\nbound boat. Dickens among his friends charms us in Forster’s volumes; why are we even more\nattentive when we hear of his endless rambles through the streets at night? The picture shows\nus nothing except a man in quest of we know not what in the dark, yet we are fascinated by it\nmore than by anything immediately available.\nThe fact is that even the most worldly worldlings get tired of the nothingness of their lives,\nand know the surfeit of sameness. Although they play the game with a bravery worthy of a\nbetter employment they feel beaten sometimes, and relieve themselves with the profound\ncomplaint that “they cannot call their souls their own.” They hanker for solitude, even if it is\nonly a few days in Paris in Summer or in Newport in the Spring. They cannot \nalways afford it;\nthen the semi-isolation of the concert, of a simple service in an unfrequented church, or a few\nhours in the auto relieves the intolerable pressure.\nThere is in every man a feeling of enmity to things—whether they happen or only exist. We\nhate the crowded, confused lumber-room where no motion is free, we want to push rubbish out\nof our sight, to reduce objects to a minimum, as the Carthusian does in his white cell with just a\nplain black cross on the wall. The notion of vacuum is repellent to us, but let enough appear\nround us and above us to create the idea of a shelter and we breathe freely and happily. We\n“find ourselves,” as the phrase goes, our poor neglected self, dearest of friends, yet dragged\nalong everywhere like an ill-treated dog, hardly ever spoken to or taken notice of, going where\nit listeth not, till at last the unnaturalness of it all appears, and, for a few hours, we live instead\nof just being alive.\nThe Art of Thinking is the art of being one’s self and this art can only be learned if one is\nby one’s self. Society only produces social thoughts, \nvulgo\n slogans, that is to say, words, but\nwords endowed with the power of a command. Solitude produces an exhilaration of\nconsciousness, the consciousness of our innermost, whatever that may be. It never fails of this\nresult. Take strong coffee one morning, to keep yourself awake, lie not in bed but on a couch\nfor two or three hours, and try to simplify and again simplify your problems, that is to say, in\nmost cases, your home-made annoyances, remembering that you are a Christian and not, as\nMadame de Sévigné used to say, \nune jolie payenne\n. You will soon understand \nwhy Descartes\nmade his discoveries lying in bed through the mornings.\nHow can we secure solitude when our path is beset with a variety of undesirables? There is\nno answer to this question if we do not really crave solitude. But if we do, solitude will come,\nfor no magnetism is as strong as a man’s wish to be let alone. The day you will notice with\nsatisfaction that you are glad of being kept waiting because this gives you a chance of being\nleft alone, you will know that you really love solitude, and you will not have to seek it or pray\nfor it any more. Solitude will be where you are. I know, in busy New York, a woman with a home\nand family who manages to be five hours in an upper room every morning, writing; I know\nanother who has rented a mysterious room on the ground-floor of her own building and has\nnever been found out yet, even by her own maids. But I know another, apparently the very type\nof the social woman with the most engaging smile on her face; she is always in her house and\nnever denies her door, yet she reads serious literature, ancient and modern, as if she had an\nocean of leisure, and in fact never complains of not having time enough. How can that be when\nher telephone ought to be buzzing all the time? People are afraid of this woman’s wish to be let\nalone with her serious books. They simply do not dare to ring up that number.\nb) \nInterior Solitude\nWe call it concentration. As exterior solitude is the reduction of human beings and even of\nobjects around us to a minimum, concentration is the elimination, one after the other, or by one\nsweeping effort, \nof all images foreign to a train of thought. This train of thought is often\nspontaneous: we then call it absorption. Common parlance rightly unites all mental conditions\nof this kind under the term “to think.” As long as whirlpools of uncontrolled images fill our\nbrain we are not supposed to think. The moment images of the same nature come under our\nobservation we know we think and simultaneously we become unconscious of most things\nextraneous to our thought.\nWho has not seen a man walking through a crowd indifferent to all except his interior\nvision? George Tyrrell had to be watched if one wished to keep him within the visible circle in\nwhich he was sitting: leave him two minutes to himself and he would be miles away. Lovers,\npoets, artists can thus be solitary in spite of their company. Alphonse Daudet never denied his\ndoor to any visitor. Only the caller, no matter who he was, was immediately given full details\nabout the chapter on which the novelist was at work. Daudet’s mind was apparently more\nactive when he could speak his thoughts, and his invention was helped rather than hampered\nby the presence of his fellow-men. People dominated by one great passion, apostles of all\ndegrees, live in their mastering purpose and do not need exterior solitude to think. It is difficult\nnot to be struck by the contrast between Saint Paul’s itinerant career and the concentration and\ncondensation of his writings. We know he dictated his letters in rhythmical sentences. The\npresence of the secretary or interpreter did not disturb him; he was used to constant company\nand no doubt craved it. During the war a strange-looking person one day sat down next me on\na bench on the \nTerrace of Saint-Germain. He was a Russian workman, a simple man with just a\nfew hundred words to his French vocabulary. In spite of this deficiency this man was eloquent.\nFor more than an hour he poured himself out in a defense of pacifism which was not in season\nbut which compelled my admiration all the same. Visibly my presence was only a pretext or an\nincentive for this worshipper of an absorbing idea.\nMany people are professionally trained to concentration. Napoleon could pass from one\nsubject to a completely different one, from strategy, for instance, to the Charter of the Comédie-\nFrançaise, as if he had been another man. He had in his mind what he called sometimes drawers,\nsometimes atlases, providing him with the matter he required. Lawyers, or spiritual directors,\noften surprise us by the undivided attention they can give to one consultant after another, but\nthey limit themselves to kindred cases and are collected rather than concentrated. However\nthey too manage to live in an interior solitude which constant knocking at their door does not\nsucceed in breaking. No doubt, such men are nearer to thought than the ordinary mortal, as a\nlibrarian is nearer to books than the costermonger in the street.\nNo complaint is more frequently heard than “I cannot concentrate” unless it be the other\ngroan “I have no memory.” On cross-examination you find that people who cannot concentrate\nare conscious either of a heaviness nullifying every intellectual effort, or of a volatility\nprecluding"

      "chapter_text": " any but a tip-of-the-wing contact with the object of attention. The moment they try\nto collect and focus their consciousness \nit seems as if there arose a whole flight of irrelevant\nimages to mock and confuse them. If they fight this confusion nervousness frequently sets in,\nand its victim will in every case prefer frivolity to pain. This accounts for the numerous cases in\nwhich people are visibly trying to do anything rather than think. I have observed boys\nfidgeting and evidently ill at ease when an interesting book was read to the class. On the\ncontrary, they would sit apparently contented when the tedious everyday drudgery went on.\nThey hated the book, interesting enough to keep them from thinking of something else, but did\nnot mind or rather liked the humdrum routine with its minimum demand and the freedom it left to\ntheir imagination.\nCan we learn to concentrate? The doubt implied in this question is in itself an inferiority\ncomplex responsible for many a failure. As a matter of fact nine out of ten men or women who\npossess the capacity of folding their wings round their attention have acquired it by patient\npractice. The nature of our mind is, as has been shown in the first part of this book, to\nsuperimpose sets of images; to eliminate as many of them as possible is an effort which only\nnecessity or some yearning can make a success. Attention is less a gift than a habit, and the\nknowledge of this ought to encourage those who wish to live inside their own souls.\nNervousness is of course a tremendous obstacle to concentration. People who are made\nnervous by company, who feel exaggeratedly the superiority in wit or looks of others, who are\nmade uncomfortable by tricks or affectations, ought not to blame themselves \nfor feeling unable\nto concentrate in the presence of their fellow-beings. Goldsmith certainly wrote like an angel:\nnothing can be more logical, in spite of its gracefulness, than \nThe Vicar of Wakefield\n. When\nOliver talked like poor Poll it was because he was made unbearably nervous and had to say\nanything rather than endure the pressure. He was not talking like poor Poll the day he stopped\nsome other writer’s praise with the admission that it tortured him to hear it. Goldsmith ought to\nhave avoided commune with literary people who carry irritability everywhere with them. If you\nare conscious of the same fluttering, seek kind, simple people rather than brilliant ones. When\nyou are accosted by someone whose talk you know by experience disturbs all your\nconcentration, smile, feel charitable and Christian, but say nothing, keep immovably silent, till\nthe other man’s sinister magnetism has spent itself in talk. You will be aware of the moment\nwhen your chances become even with his.\nInterest of any kind produces concentration naturally. Selfish people concentrate on their\nown immediate profits, idealists on their ideal. We cannot be five minutes with a person without\nrealizing what the nature and elevation of his interest may be: whether it is gain, vanity or\npleasure, or whether it is some aspect of our multiform wish for the world’s betterment.\nDisinterestedness is its own reward, for it fills the soul more than any conscious effort. Nobility\nof point of view or purpose, an indifference to petty advantages, the charity of the true\nChristian, the never-interrupted contemplation of the mystic, all seem to us at the same time to\nconfer intellectual \nsuperiority and to create a paradise for their possessor.\nIf we descend to the merely intellectual level, we shall find that here too real interest is\nessential for concentration and creates it in an instant. The same boy who goes a-wool-\ngathering when he has to write a literary essay can concentrate for half a day on mathematics or\non a new radio implement. The same people who think they can only read the lightest kind of\nfiction can get pleasure out of innumerable memoirs undoubtedly easier to read than novels.\nThey never dare to say that they concentrate on novels, because people would think it\nridiculous, but they would not hesitate to admit that they concentrated on the \nchroniques\n of\ncourts, and, in fact, they would know concentration as well as most historians. “Walk a\nhundred steps straight away from the main road”—Doudan says—“if you stick to one\ndirection you will find some deliciously shaded spot or even a springing well.” I used to know a\nFrench priest who, strangely enough, cared only for the theatre, a taste he could hardly indulge\nin a sleepy cathedral town. Beginning with the plays published by \nL’Illustration\n, this frivolous\necclesiastic gradually formed a vast dramatic collection. In a few years he was regarded as an\nauthority on the modern drama, and when death interrupted an occupation which had become a\nspecialty without ceasing to be a pleasure the sale of those volumes accumulated to satisfy a\nwhim, was a literary event. To collect is to specialize and specialization is only another word for\nconcentration. The upshot is that we are sure to concentrate the moment we have an interest or\nfind a pleasure in doing so. The Art of \nThinking is largely the finding out what gives our\nintellect its satisfaction without any effort or any restlessness.\nHowever, we cannot always follow our inclination in thinking as we do in acting. There are\ndull problems that we have to tackle; we know intellectual duties not any easier to discharge\nthan moral obligations: we may love poetry and dislike history, like Shelley, but we feel we must\nnot imitate Shelley in his indifference to history, for only genius can disregard the general\ncanons of culture. How can we concentrate on subjects which, not being attractive, naturally\nproduce absent-mindedness? Another chapter will be devoted to mental exercises every one of\nwhich tends to create concentration. So would newspaper problems, questions and answers of\nall descriptions, cross word puzzles, etc. Madame de Maintenon, in her direct honest way,\ndescribes reflection as “thinking attentively several times over of the same thing.” This\ndefinition provides excellent guidance when the object of our concentration is one and not\nmany and when it lies well in the field of our mental microscope. But frequently things are\ncomplicated instead of being simple, or we are trying to discover—not just examine—thoughts,\nand the problem of concentration in such cases becomes different from mere attention to a\nschool-boy’s lesson.\nLet it be understood, to begin with, that concentration is impossible if we are fagged or dull.\nToo much sleep or too little sleep leaves a vacuum in our brain. So does too much eating or too\nmuch fasting. So does too much exercise or too little. Do not imagine that when you feel sleepy\nmentally, violent physical \nexercise, like squash, will wake you up. It will set all your animal\nspirits in motion, but tingling arteries generally go along with a spangly rush of disorderly\nimages to the brain. Reading will not help your mind into what you think is the proper path\neither. Complete immobility, or a peaceful cigarette, or ten minutes at the open window, or\nstrolling alone under the trees, or, sometimes, a cup of tea, will bring you nearer to the legitimate\nfountain of your thoughts than anything else.\nWhen your heart is calmed by the unusual stillness of your mind, when the moths of\ndistraction have dispersed, you are ready for concentration, but you may still find yourself\nfacing a blank. Many intellectual workers are conscious that their effort to eliminate superfluity\nseems to have eliminated essentials as well. What do I want to think about? they wonder. What\nam I interested in? Am I interested in anything?\nPeople endowed with good memories seldom experience this barrenness. On the least\nprovocation their drawers or atlases fly open and they feel flush with data. It is the curse of\nmost people so gifted that their data have long been stereotyped, borrowed as they often are\nfrom somebody else and never improved upon. On the contrary, people conscious of working\non living matter, impressions, intuitions, or sentiments, pretty well pleased with their minds one\nday, disgusted the next, are, so to speak, cohabiting with nature, and their intellectual existence\nis a drama. Their very lack of memory makes them feel the necessity of continuity. They strive\nto rejoin themselves, to be in the natural flux of their conscious or subconscious existence from\nthe days of childhood till now. Their memory is not an indelible board, it is m"

      "chapter_text": "ore the\nconsciousness of a few high lights, peaks of interest round which subordinate data naturally\ngroup themselves. Historians like Michelet or Carlyle obviously have memories organized in\nthat way, but the main lines of even books like Gibbon’s \nRoman Empire\n, or Fustel de\nCoulanges’s \nLa Cité Antique\n, show a dominant interest more purely intellectual, it is true, but\nstill productive of crystallization. On the contrary, Mommsen—to whom I owe too much to\nspeak of him disrespectfully—had an infallible but inorganic memory. Our effort ought to be to\nresume where we left off the last time we were vitally and completely active. We should never\ntake up the newspaper without remembering that our interest in politics, that is to say, in\ncontemporary history, must not be mere curiosity. We want the world to be wiser and less cruel;\nand, if there is a man or a country giving us hopes of the improvement foreseen by the Isaiahs\nof all countries, it is the progress of that man or that country that we want to follow. Our\ncontinuity on that plane is the condition of our memory as well as the channel of our\nconcentration.\nConcentration which, at first sight, is obtained by elimination, the elimination of images not\nharmonious with our trend of thought, can best be obtained by the conjuring of a suitable\nbackground. And this background is nothing else than the multiplication of harmonious\nimages. If I want to concentrate, in order to understand it, on American isolation, for instance, I\nmust, first of all, empty my sensibility of all irritation caused by narrow-minded defenses of this\nisolation, then I must rapidly people \nmy imagination with such notions as the vastness of\nAmerica—best realised by the extent of its lakes or its deserts, its lack of obtrusive neighbors,\nits self-supporting capacity, its tendency to conformity and its surprising realization of the\nwords “foreign,” and “foreigner”; I can remember the Roumanian taxi-driver in New York who\nonce spoke to me of his country, left twenty years before, as if he had exchanged purgatory for\nHeaven; he helped me to understand the Pilgrims, men who had shaken the dust off their feet\non the old continent—the very reverse of colonists; and the Pilgrims, in their turn, help me to\nunderstand the rebellious, the defiant ring of the word “American” in the newspapers of the\npre-revolutionary period I have on a few occasions consulted. It is enough. If I finally remember\nthat Europe appears to the untraveled American as a many-mouthed hungry monster, my\nconcentration is complete. I can think of nothing but the isolation of America and I understand\nit so well that, were it not for another set of images near by, I should promptly share in it.\nMultiply such visions and distraction will not know where to have you.\nThis is the natural and vital way of thinking. All our notions come from such groups of\nimages and when we wish to restore life to an idea hardening into words we instinctively recall\nthe concrete circumstances from which it was originally evolved. Not otherwise do speakers\nwho hate memorising create in themselves the mood—both intellectual and imaginative—from\nwhich real eloquence will flow. The interior cinema unrolling its pictures for their benefit is not,\nlike more abstract trains of thought, at the mercy of distractions; and the hubbub \nof the dinner-\ntable, or the revolving scenery outside the carriage-window, hardly interferes with it.\nAnother infallible method of concentrating or, so to speak, tempering one’s attention, is to\ntake pen in hand and prepare to write down what our mind will dictate. There is in the very\ngesture something imperative which the most wandering mind seldom resists. A successful\nwriter whom I was asking about her methods of working told me: “I take a blank sheet and a\npencil, I sit at a perfectly bare table and pretty quickly a story comes.” So also did Anton\nChekhov who wrote for the magazines stories which were not magazine-stories like those of\nthis lady. But it is especially when we want to be clear and definite, to make up our minds about\nsome issue, that the sheet and pencil process proves helpful.\nApart from the things in which we are vitally interested, the more or less conscious objects\non which our egotism concentrates without any outward incentive, teacher, or advice, we\nspend our lives in vagueness. Most men and women die vague about life and death, religion or\nmorals, politics or art. Even about purely practical issues we are far from being clear. We\nimagine that other people know definitely their own minds about their children’s education,\nabout their own careers, or about the use they should make of their money. The notion helps us\nto imagine that we ourselves are only separated from decision on these important issues by the\nlightest curtain of uncertainty. But it is not so. Other people, like ourselves, live in perpetual\nvagueness. Like us they foolishly imagine they are thinking \nof some important subject when\nthey are merely thinking of thinking about it. When this fallacy has been nursed for some time\nin our subconsciousness we decide that the question admits of no compelling answer and we\nact according to the pressure of circumstances, or perfunctory advice, or the slogans of the\nmoment. It is surprising how few people’s testaments are really their wills. They had never been\nable to know their own minds, so the lawyer or some relation dictated the document.\nIf we should sit before the blank sheet, and write on two columns the arguments pro and\ncon an idea that occur to us, the truth would flash on us. We should either be struck by the\nevidence of some considerations or, no less startlingly, should we see the necessity for seeking\nadvice on this or that point. Advice of whom? Do not go back to the illusion of just thinking of\nthinking about the possible persons. Take another sheet and write down the \npros\n and \ncons\nconcerning advisers. Quite instinctively you will keep those sheets in one envelope. This will\nbe a \ndossier\n, in every point similar to those shaping the destinies of empires.\nRobinson Crusoe had recourse to this method when he could have recourse to nothing\nelse. Saint Ignatius Loyola describes it at full length and has made it the basis of spiritual life in\nhis Society; few people know that the fifty odd folio diaries left by that incomparable adviser,\nPrince Albert, hold the written preparation of the suggestions he used to give Queen Victoria.\nTry the system once, you will never desert it. It is only fair to warn you that the habit is apt to\nbecome tyrannical; you will mechanically \nreach for your pad and pencil not only when you\nhave to decide about selling your house, but even when you have to pack up a trunk.\nEverything has its inconveniences and I will point out more fully further down some drawbacks\nof fixing one’s thought by writing. But making up our mind is a necessity and better be an\nunsuspected crank than too visible a weathercock.\nOn the whole, concentration is a natural state which can easily be reproduced by simple\nmethods. It is only supposed to be exceptional because people do not try and, in this, as in so\nmany other things, starve within an inch of plenty. Those who do try have never been\ndisappointed in the process but have sometimes experienced disappointment in themselves.\n“I only find ordinary thoughts,” they complain.\n“Yes, but they are your own and better produce ordinary thoughts than nothing.”\n“I do see glimpses of deep truth or am conscious of brilliant flashes, but they vanish like\nwill o’ the wisps.”\n“Blessed are you. You will not be eloquent, but you will be phosphorescent.”\nA few years ago I sat at dinner next to an American woman who charmed me by the subtlety\nof her judgment, but whose short flights constantly disappointed expectations constantly\nrising again. Yet, I never can open Joubert without thinking of her, a great achievement for a\nsociety woman. And did not Montaigne admit, without much concern, that he could “charge a\ndifficulty only once or twice after which he had to look away from it”? Boys who try \nto read the\nhour on a church-clock a mile off know the dodge. What we are expected to do is only to make\nthe most of our possibilities.\nc) \nMaking time\nHave you really no time? Are you sincere, or are you just repeating what everybody else is\nsaying? No time! The extremity of poverty! Perhaps your idea of having time is not having\nsome\n time to yourself, but having \nall\n the time, having n"

Examine your conscience\nand answer.\nAxiom: Very busy people always find time for everything.\nConversely, people with immense leisure find time for nothing.\nPerhaps you do not know what concentration means. If so, sell all your possessions, leave\nyour dearest and nearest, and having re-read the previous chapter devote three days or maybe\nthree hours to exercises in concentration. You will soon find out whether you know how to\nconcentrate or not.\nIn the meantime, you will do well to ask yourself a few questions.\n1—\nAbout saving time.\nIs there no time you can reclaim, not from your work, not from your exercise, not from your\nfamily or friends, but from pleasure that really does not give you much pleasure, from empty\ntalk at the Club, from inferior plays, from doubtfully enjoyable week ends or not very profitable\ntrips?\nHave you learned how not to give in to idlers? Can you steel yourself against the\ntemptation to give pleasure to people whose laziness needs no assistance? Do you discriminate\nbetween kindness and weakness, never refusing to do a good turn, but \nalways refusing to be a\ndupe? Are you an absolute slave to the telephone?\nDo you know how to gather up fragments of time lest they perish? Do you realise the value\nof minutes? One of the Lamoignons had a wife who always kept him waiting a few minutes\nbefore dinner which in those days was in broad daylight, at three o’clock. After a time it\noccurred to him that eight or ten lines could be written during this interval, and he had paper\nand ink laid in a convenient place for that purpose. In time—for years are short but minutes are\nlong—several volumes of spiritual meditations were the result. Mankind might be divided\nbetween the multitude who hate to be kept waiting because they get bored and the happy few\nwho rather like it because it gives them time for thought. The latter lead the rest, of course.\nWhat do you do in trains, cars or taxis? If you do nothing in perfect contentment, well and\ngood, but if you feel restless you are to blame. Trollope, who was a commuter, wrote many a\nchapter in the train. You might read these: they are worth your while, and Trollope is in fashion.\nYou cannot be reading or thinking without avoiding company: people no doubt will remark that\nVere de Vere keeps very much to himself, but it cannot be helped. If you try to think, you must\nexpect to be a little apart and not a little above.\nDo you carry a little book, a great little book of the approved President Eliot description, or,\noh joy! one of your own finding, in your breast pocket?—“It isn’t done.”—“Oh! I beg your\npardon, I meant a pack of cards of course. Excuse my absent-mindedness.”\nWhat time do you get up? Could it not be three quarters of an hour, or half an hour earlier?\nIf you give up reading in bed—a practice condemned by all oculists and by not a few moralists,\nyou can manage it. Nobody has ever been able to explain why a Latin education should give\nthat curious superiority to people, but it does. There is the same mystery about saving the\nmorning—“Clean up the morning trench,” Fénelon wrote to a lady—“for intellectual work.”\nSomehow it does the trick. An hour in the morning is worth two, and the nothingness that must\ninevitably come in the silly hours afterwards will not submerge you.\n2—\nAbout frittering time away.\nDo you often hear yourself saying: “I forgot” or “I didn’t think”? These ejaculations mean\nthat you are losing time, have to go over beaten ground several times, through your own fault.\nWe should never forget, at all events so seldom that it will be a surprise.\nYou will hardly ever forget, you will not be fumbling and recommencing, if you possess two\neasily acquired habits, foresight and order. To foresee means to imagine in advance. A quarter\nof an hour can easily be saved in the Pullman if you have visualized what night or morning\nthings ought to be on the top of your suit-case instead of lurking where the fingers will\nanxiously feel for them with an accompanying scowl of the brow. Foresee that the customs\nexamination means your trunk-key in a well-defined pocket. If you are liable to the emigration\nman’s cross-examination, do not trust to your passport alone, but have in readiness a letter,\nasked in advance of your American hostess, \nwhere there will be references to Long Island\nweek-ends or to the Opera, but no references to lecturing, for lecturing is sure to mean atheism\nor Bolshevism. If you forget to write for that letter four weeks before sailing it will come after\nyou have sailed. If you forget it in your stateroom and have to fetch it therefrom amid the\ndisgust and scorn of the other aliens, you will find that your trunk has just been moved out of\nyour cabin and is somewhere on its way to letter D.\nThese are elementary exercises in imaginative foresight. You will do well to visualize more\nimportant possibilities such as marriage, old age, illness, death or lunacy, failure in this or\nincomplete success in that, errors on your part and treason or stupidity on the part of others.\nRead the future, do not be the bleating sheep or the silly frisking lamb, and as your imagination\nshows you things as they will probably be, only not so bad, jot them down and keep the notes\ncarefully. With surprising rapidity you will find yourself in the possession of note-books telling\nyou with fulness and clarity all you must do preparatory to moving out or selling out or other\nimportant outs and ins.\n“What a bore!” you exclaim, “what a slavery to things!”—No! what freedom! what\nindependence and security! My note-book is a fortune. So is another fat dossier in which my\nblunders are recorded for profitable private reading.\nOrder is the sister of foresight, as you can see. He is unnatural who, visualizing a call on So\nand So does not put in his greatcoat pocket, or next to his hat, the book long ago borrowed of\nSo and So. A bench in the hall strewn with things that have to \ngo out, memos on the rug round\nyour desk do not mean untidiness but order. Things should be where they will not be forgotten.\n“\nA\nRE\n you sure you know the difference between order and tidiness, dear Madam? Your boudoir\ncertainly looks wonderfully well-groomed and manicured, but where is that rather important\nletter which came Saturday from the lawyer?” . . . Ah! where is it? If we should peep under the\ncover of that exquisite \nbonheur du jour\n what should we see? What a conglomeration of letters,\nsome in their envelopes, some out of them, of bills, of invitations, concert tickets, old programs\nand what not! How long it will take to find the lawyer’s letter! How many times will the dainty\nfingers dart at a pile of papers, in the firm belief that the note must be there, only to get out of it\nwith the impatience of the disappointed humming-bird!\nNow let us go at it with a little order. Let us have on this chair the opened letters, on that\ntable the others, on the \nStandard Dictionary\n the bills, everything else in the waste basket.\n“Wait! on one of those programs, oh! on one of those programs are two lines of Crashaw\nwhich I would not lose for the world.”\n“Here they are. Where do they go?”\n“Ah! where? In the \nCambridge History of Literature\n, section Crashaw? . . .”\n“No, believe me, fetch a large strong envelope, tear it open at the top, write Crashaw on it,\nput in that program, and lay it on one of your shelves. Pretty soon there will be fifty more such\nwrappers and your husband will say admiringly that this is a \nregular office. . . . Now, glance at\nthe opened letters. Not a red pencil mark on any, you surprise me. Well, you have to read the\nletters all over again. . . . All these useless? Why are they kept then? Tear them to pieces and\ninto the waste basket.”\n“These two from Mrs. Chambers I want to keep.”\n“Big envelope, Chambers written on top, lay next to Crashaw. Simplify.”\n“These two, these four, these fifteen have to be answered.”\n“Heavens! I understand why all foreigners complain that Americans do not answer letters.\nMost business-like nation in the world! Well, there is no help for it. You are a lady, you must\nanswer letters. Take fifteen envelopes, put the fifteen letters in them and, in the bitterness of\nyour heart, write fifteen superscriptions. Henceforth, the moment a letter comes, you will red-\npencil the important passages, ask yourself whether this letter is for the waste basket, the\nChambers-Crashaw shelf, or the to-be-answered pile. If the latter, put the letter in an envelope,\nwrite the superscript"

There’s the \nbonheur du jour\n empty! and here’s the waste basket full! and here’s a\nhappy surprised smile on your face, and you know now the difference between tidiness which\nis hypocrisy and order which means a place for everything and everything in its place, whether\nit be a shelf, an envelope, or the waste basket.\n“Do not say that it only took half an hour to clean out the little desk and consequently you\nonly wasted thirty minutes by not being methodical. For the same jumble that was in your desk\nwas also in your mind, and even in your life, my dear lady; you lost time and thought little of it,\nbut moreover you were ineffective, a poor fumbling tennis player who never gave a smash.\nYour ideal should be never to waste a step, a word or a gesture. Looseness is the reverse of\nelegance. Indeed it is in everything the first cousin of slovenliness.”\nNext to lack of order, one of the most fatal ways of wasting time as well as weakening one’s\nlife is to hesitate before acting. A friend of mine came back from his four years in a prisoners’\ncamp in Germany with the nervous inability to decide called \nabulia\n. I was watching him one\nday when he stood before the hat rack for a full minute uncertain on which peg he should hang\nhis \nképi\n. The scene was pathetic. It is only irritating when the hesitancy is the consequence,\nnot of ill health, but of lack of energy, intelligence, or method. Some people can dress in forty\nminutes, because they have learned the automatism which M. Bergson used to recommend so\npersuasively. Others will take an hour and a half either because they have not adopted the\ninvariable order which, in time, becomes automatism, or because they hesitate before decisions\nwhich ought to be mere gestures. You see them looking round and wondering what next,\nsometimes looking out at the window or smoking a cigarette to brighten up their wits, or\nendlessly hesitating between two collars or two ties.\nAn old French word preserved only in a few \nNorthern districts describes this graphically. It\nis the verb \ntourniquer\n which shows us a person aimlessly moving in a circle till an inspiration\nfor definite action comes. Of course the circling has a tendency to last longer while the\ninspiration grows slower. Some people simply use up their lives thus beginning and not\nbeginning to begin. Five minutes before a sheet of paper with the famous question of Foch on\ntop: “\nDe quoi s’agit-il?\n”, and a pencil to answer it, would break the sinister charm, but chronic\nhesitancy looks for no remedy. Its answer to itself is: we must first think about it; but the\nthinking never begins. In fact the word beginning is terrifying. Nothing can be truer and more\nencouraging to men equally gifted with a human desire for action and a human indulgence of\nlaziness than the Greek sentence: \nThe beginning is half the thing\n. Writers know it well.\nStudents at school ought to be taught how true it is. You have to write at college an essay on\nRonsard. Go straight to the French professor who can best give you a list of a dozen passages\nshowing you Ronsard at his most sublime, at his most graceful, at his worst greco-latin, etc. Go\nstraight home and read these, making notes of what you observe and of how you react. Lose\nno time and sort these notes. Think about them till some flesh comes on these bones, and,\nwithout losing time, write down what you have to say and say no more.\nYour will can be prepared and drawn up in the same way. So can your answer to a proposal\nfor a partnership. So can your Machiavellian campaign for bringing So and So round to offering\nyou a partnership. Learn to attack things frontally but according to the most scientific methods.\nBe the Lindbergh \nof whatever little ocean you have to cross. Our life should consist of a\nthousand brief dramas, complete in themselves, swift as a game of poker. Some business men\nhave given me a truly artistic pleasure by the infallibility of their dictation. Each letter meant a\nrapid weighing of \npros\n and \ncons\n, a decision, and the thing done at once. Other business\nmen. . . .\nHave you ever begun to learn French or German? Yes? and you feel like beginning again?\nBelieve me, do not. One experiment should be enough. The demon of hesitancy delights in\ntelling people that they ought to learn languages. Rather collect match-boxes like the Russian\nprince in \nSylvestre Bonnard\n. He had only one missing specimen to find and the search filled his\nlife. Much rather begin to-day, this very morning, some kind of social work that will give you a\nright to eat your dinner without shame.\nSo time can be “made” and the well-worn phrase is not a deception. If you possess lists of\nthings to be done in given circumstances (before going to the country, before sailing, before\nentering on a study); if your agenda is a clearly-sectioned table showing you at a glance what\nyou have to do, you will be a busy person, but you will have a sense of power over things.\nAnd if you know how to concentrate, i. e., how to use the keen edge of your mind, having time\nand possessing the tool, you will only need good material for thought. It is to this material that\nthe next chapters will be devoted.\n\n2. LIVING ONE’S LIFE ON A HIGHER PLANE\na) \nThought-producing images\nRemember that our mind is active on a constant succession of more or less connected images.\nThese images, as we said, characterize our mental quality. Pass from a noble art gallery to the\npicture department of a store, and you will be conscious of mediocrity coming after distinction.\nEvery man’s imagination is a picture gallery. If the pictures were visible, instead of having to be\ninferred from the talk or general deportment of the individual, we could grade our fellow-beings\nas we do vases in a shop.\nIt is useless to do more than recall what was said in § 2 of Part I about the general inferiority\nof the images filling the minds of most human beings. Many of them are hardly superior to\nthose constituting the mentality of the animal, always remembering that animals are not\ninfrequently far above human beings in sensibility or in the capacity for love. The mind of an\nhabitual drunkard, or that of an undeveloped peasant knows little besides images connected\nwith elemental wants. Sex maniacs, of whom there are more than people imagine, even the\naverage specimen, the well-dressed man who follows women through the streets, are almost\nincapable of producing more than one category of images. Misers, men who build a fortune, as\nmodern \nparlance prefers to say, are also hypnotized by one tyrannical set of pictures. So is the\nambitious worldling, the social climber who sees on his inward scroll mostly press notices of\nhis attendance at committees and public banquets or decorations and titles. The most usual\ntype, of course, is the man or woman imprisoned in his or her paltry existence, and endlessly\nattentive to its shabby details. Jane Austen is almost ferocious in her descriptions of the\nsuperior specimens of this inferior type, the one of course which we jostle every day.\nWe all probably have a word in our vocabulary to describe this all-pervading mediocrity.\nWhen I was a boy in our little French town I used to patronize a shop kept by a M. Pailla who\nwas also something of a farmer and was not devoid of the something that makes a gentleman.\nHe was a rotund and short elderly chap unexpectedly nimble on his little feet. While looking\nround his shop for the particular bonbons or jujubes I wanted, he would lend an ear to the\nconversation kept up by his tall wife and lean daughters in the next room. I came away\ndisappointed when I did not hear him sputter out his disgusted appreciation of their tattle: “\n’tits\ndétails, ’tits détails!\n” which stood for \npetits détails\n, and has served me through life to\ncharacterize inwardly nineteen-twentieths of what I hear and not a little of what I say.\nCan we think as we like? or is not our thought as fated as our breathing?\nCertainly we cannot help thinking any more than we can help breathing, but, just as we can\nchoose to breathe pure air in a pine wood on a high hill, we can place our mind where the\nimages it will work \nupon will be of a higher nature.

      "chapter_text": "sip of Europe? Nobody can take real interest in the affairs of\nthe world without conferring a living personality on those great \ndramatis personæ\n of history:\nthe old nations of Europe, the strange resurgent peoples of Asia, or America now fully come of\nage. I can speak of Great Britain and the United States as I might of two of my neighbors. It will\ntake a great deal of observation of the latter to give a broad human value to what I may say of\nthem, but if I say of Britain that a long habit of world-wide power has prepared her \nélite\n for\nshouldering responsibilities, whereas America, not quite conscious yet of her new power, is\nmore willing to be kind than to be a leader, I shall be expressing a thought. Such is the influence\nof a vast scene as compared with a narrow one.\nIn the same way Signor Mussolini was personally as interesting or even more so twenty\nyears ago than now, yet what we learn about him day after day is history and not personality.\nAgain, there is but little difference between the interests, ambitions and rivalries of nations\nand those of clans or families, as young students of history ought to be told from the\nbeginning, yet, international questions seem to belong to only a few privileged observers.\nNothing can be farther away from the truth. Neither Madame de Sévigné, nor Saint-Simon,\nnor most authors of memoirs possessed a wide range of political judgment, but they now seem\nhigh above their fellows because their interest was of a dignified order. Anybody can rise to\nthat level and must \nblame himself if he does not. During the war millions of simple individuals\ndid it without the least affectation and yet in the proper tone, because the daily topic was\nhistory. To-day they have relapsed to mere stories and their thinking has lost proportionately.\nYet, the same elements for high and wide thinking daily offer themselves. I have never forgotten\nthe sunny Sunday in 1914 when the extras announcing the Sarajevo news were sold on the\nboulevards. I could overhear a few people talking history, but most looked away from this tragic\noverture of the greatest drama in history to go back to the winner at Longchamps, for it was the\nday of the Grand Prix. Hardly a week passes, during the history-fraught years we are living,\nwithout such a chance for natural yet high speculation coming our way. Still, most people insist\non talking about Jones or Brown.\nIt is strange that so many professional critics should make the mistake of seeking original\nsubjects among the lesser characters in literary history. Some minors, of course, are of\nparamount interest to the historian because, clumsily or unwittingly, they started an important\nmovement. Arthur Young counts in the history of Romanticism, and Champfleury means more\nthan Flaubert in the apparition of Realism, but one book about Young or Champfleury is\nenough, whereas libraries can be written about Balzac, Flaubert or Byron. If a young scholar\nasks me for a subject about which plenty can be said that has never as yet been said, I reply\nunhesitatingly: Homer, Plato, Virgil, Milton, Racine, or Alexander, Cæsar, Napoleon, or the\nApostolic Age, or the Revolution, or Death, or Love. The test \nshould be: what is likely to\ninterest an intelligent child? for children do not care for trivial details till they have been spoiled\nby imitation. As for the \na posteriori\n proof, it is plentiful. What book on Napoleon has \nnot\n been\nsuccessful? Would a young woman like Madame de Staël have made her mark, as she did, had\nnot her high intellect been attracted, from the first, by such vital subjects as the human\npassions, the foundations of literature, the Revolution, or German Romanticism? What parts of\nsuch an all-embracing production as Sainte Beuve’s do we re-read, and which do we skip? Do\nwe ever prefer a collection of match-boxes to one of Raphaels? The curse of daily journalism is\nthat the triviality of its topics invites perfunctoriness in treatment. The moment the headline\ntakes us back to something rich and deep, the reporter makes room for a poet.\nIt is impossible to spend an hour in a room with a man approaching greatness without\nfeeling the contagiousness of distinguished thinking. Such men cannot always be found, or our\nchances for meeting them may be limited. But anybody with an average knowledge of the\nhistory of nations, literature, philanthropy, or art, not to speak of the history of great\nreligionists or saints, can people his imagination with groups of superior men in every realm. I\nshall have an occasion further on to point out how we can summon any great man to bear us\ncompany when we feel at all lonely, but our serious hours cannot be devoted to a more useful\noccupation than studying the lives or ideas of great men.\nPlutarch’s \nParallel Lives\n gave first-rate food to the minds of the \nélite\n in all nations until it\nwas regarded as a classic instead of an amusing book. \nMadame de Maintenon, who was neither\na king’s mistress, as too many people in America curiously believe, or a bore, as modern French\npeople foolishly imagine, tells us that her Huguenot mother insisted on her and her brother\nconstantly bringing Plutarch’s heroes into their games as well as conversations, and adds that\nthe command was obeyed with delight. The French school-boy does not read any more\nPlutarch than his syllabus compels him to wade through for his Greek examination, but he\nreplaces him by his text-book on French literature: children love the exceptional and abhor\nbanality in other people’s as well as in their own lives. Musset’s moral example is a poor\nsubstitute for Demosthenes; but as Musset’s weaknesses finally produced the poetry of the\nNuit d’Octobre\n, the boyish inference is that there is an elegant way of being ordinary and that\nis what should be copied. His mind is full of this thought when you discover an unwonted\ngravity on his brow while he packs his books into his \nserviette\n. Who can say that this boy’s\nthought is not nearer to real thinking then than it will be ten years later when the smart young\nlawyer or financier will be attentive mostly to money, success, and women?\nNo remedy for the banality of thought produced by the inferiority of our lusts can equal the\nmeditation of great lives. Open Clemenceau’s little book on Demosthenes and you will see and\npositively touch as with your own hand the effect of a constant preference for great patriots\nand great thinkers in an existence which journalism, politics, duelling and all the empty\neffervescence of the Forum might otherwise have made shallow. Many degrees below\nClemenceau I have more than once seen Socialist \nranters rise to unexpected dignity by merely\nclaiming that their action is in a line with that of the great Revolutionists. The sole mention of\ngreatness acts magically because we all realize its unfailing influence upon us.\nIf, at any moment, you are unable to name a great man who is, or has recently been, having\nan influence on your conduct, you will be passing the verdict: ORDINARY on the quality of\nyour own thought and existence. Conversely, give me the public utterances of this or that\npolitician or so-called leader, and I shall be able to tell you whether he is haunted by some\nirresistible souvenir of greatness or merely moved by the interests in the air. America does not\nrealize how much she owes to the fact that Lincoln is still a living presence on the Capitol hill,\nunavoidable even if it is not sought.\nUnconvinced? cold? miles away from Lincoln or Plutarch, my fair young reader? \nAh! que la\nvie est quotidienne!\n Still you need not despair and commit suicide by plunging headlong into\nchocolates or boys. Surely you like nature. I met you once alone and happy on the cliff-way in\nNewport. You like music, you like pictures, and you adore laces. The idea of Rome means\nsomething to you when you cross the gangway to the \nDuilio\n. It is enough. What a\ndistinguished person you would be, what a brilliant parterre your mind would look like if you\nwould generally exclude that which does not give you the greatest enjoyment of which you are\ncapable. But it is one of the mysteries of our nature that when our table is laden with delicious\nthings, we go and cry before Mother Hubbard’s cupboard.\nb) \nMoral elevation a condition of high thinking\n“Great thoughts arise from the heart” Vauvenargues says; and Joubert: “There is no light in\nsouls in which there is no warmth.”\nThe modern French, in spite of Romanticism, show a growing tendency to rejoin t"

In fact, it is impossible to live without\nnoticing how barren our intellect becomes when it is supposed to be given unbounded\nchances. On the other hand, we must all meet some day with men intellectually our inferiors, yet\nfor whose thoughts we cannot help expressing admiration. Read the life of that French beggar,\nSaint Labre, living in rags and filth on the steps of the Roman churches. Read the life of the\nhumble \ncuré\n of Ars, Jean-Baptiste Vianney, so little gifted intellectually that he was all but\nrefused for ordination at a period when the French clergy was too depleted to be fastidious.\nThese two men knew nothing, but they saw everything, and their view of the world, what they\nwould have been surprised to hear called their philosophy and its expression, were of supreme\ndistinction. Look at their pictures. You will see in their eyes and over their faces something\nluminous which means nothing if it does not reflect thought.\nLove, whether it be the attraction of Truth, or pure, simple, elemental love, always opens up\nthe intellect and gives it the freedom of genius. Maternity also acts in that way. Animals of\ncourse show it wonderfully, and—let it be said without any attempt at cheap paradoxicalness—\neven artificial women \nshow it too. The transformation lasts as long as the flow of love retains\nits power.\nSo does any great altruistic impulse filling the whole soul. The war gave a unique chance to\nthousands of men and women with unemployed reserves of devotion. I remember a well-known\nAmerican woman who called on me at the Pavilion Belgiojoso, in the Collège Stanislas, towards\n1908. She wanted information about the movement of the \nSillon\n, at that time in its full force. But\nI felt that she would have welcomed information about anything that might have given her\nsoul-energies a chance. I remember the eager questions in the throaty but distinguished voice:\nevery word betrayed a suppressed longing for something that would liberate her head and\nheart. The war gave her the chance which her yearning was praying for. She spent herself freely\nand her reward came at once. I met her again in California in 1919. She had undergone a\ntransformation similar to that which a happy marriage is often known to produce. The\nsuppressed impassioned something which made her at the same time distinguished and pitiful\nhad disappeared, but in its place there was a superb fulness in the working of the mind and a\nmastery of persuasive language. Fulfilment was implied in every nuance.\nHer case is one of many thousands. A missionary of the real kind, a hospital worker of the\nreal kind, the innumerable varieties of social workers, women of the type of Mrs. Howe, or\nFlorence Nightingale, or Sister Rosalie, apparently merely devoted to an ideal of action, are\ntransformed mentally by it, and, as Madame Guyon used to say, could write or speak endlessly\nabout it. Intellectual inferiority \ncomplexes melt away like thin snow in the proximity of love, and\nthe liberation of the soul is complete.\nNowhere is there such a chance of this liberation as in the United States where the primitive\nimpulse towards corporative and coöperative betterment, far from having spent itself, seems to\nbe in full force. Whoever has been engaged, were it once in his life, in the instructive task of\ncollecting money for a charity must have learned that, contrary to the general belief, many\nAmericans of means can refuse a dollar, but also that nowhere will an idea worth collaboration\nfind such collaborators as it finds there. Intellectual generosity—of which charity is only the\nnatural sequence—is an instinct with the American. It is not surprising therefore that he should\nfind so many chances of developing through pure love, and that the corporate thinking of the\nUnited States, what people call its ideal, should be of an exceptional quality.\nBut suppose these chances should fail honest desire, suppose all men were happy and\nfifty-six thousand stray cats had not been found enduring misery in the streets of Boston alone\nin one year, would it not yet be possible to rise up to the region of thought through moral\nefforts? Stop the stream of your consciousness for an instant, look into your soul, arrest the\nimages forming and dissolving there. What will you see? Petty self-love, of course, but even\nmore frequently, petty irritations. Our nature is neither noble nor generous. We remember\nslights more easily than kindnesses. We may have lived for days in a home or a foreign country\nwithout meeting with anything except courtesy. The moment \nwe feel irritated or offended we\nforget the happiness and nurse the paltry grievances. We are touchy and on our guard. Self-\nseeking possesses us. As we get older and should be more detached we become on the\ncontrary more alert to the main chance. A studied appearance of frankness which we acquire in\nthe course of years veils realities which we would not care to exhibit for inspection. Joseph de\nMaistre once said he did not know what a scoundrel’s soul might be, but he knew well what the\nsoul of a good man consisted of, and it was horrid. It is the whispered confession of us all. No\nwonder therefore if, instead of noble images filling our minds, there should be there a plentiful\ncrop not only of \n’tits détails\n, but of pretty low visions. Thought worth the name can never arise\nfrom a nasty growth. But just as we can prefer decent company to ordinary or worse, or good\nbooks to poor ones, we can crush out inferior thoughts, and invite better ones. Just as we learn\nto sit up straight, or do not give in, even in our privacy, to too much freedom of attitudes, we\ncan drive out soul visitors we are not proud of. This humble beginning of sanctity will be\nrewarded by a straighter judgment and by that broader sympathy which is an aspect of\nintelligence. Good men generally think right. When they do not, it seems unnatural, and the\nlower parts of our soul, the insurgents in us always ready for an outcry, triumph meanly.\nc) \nHigher thoughts from books\nIf you will refer to § c. of Section 2, in Part II, on the danger of weak reading, you will know\nwhat to expect from this. Reading, to most people, means an ashamed way of killing time\ndisguised \nunder a dignified name. Trifling with print in that manner quickly diminishes the\nresilience of the intellect. It goes directly against an Art of Thinking.\nIf you wish to use books as an adjuvant to thought, they must be books that will not merely\namuse or put your mind to sleep, but, on the contrary, will keep it wide awake and alert.\nWhat are those books?\nWhat they are \nyou\n know best, and I do not know in the least. A book, like a landscape, is a\nstate of consciousness varying with readers. There exists some book, pamphlet, article in an\nencyclopædia, or possibly an old clipping from a newspaper that once set you thinking; there\nmay be many; indeed you may be one of those rare beings with whom a few lines of print are\nfood enough for thought because, as Lamartine says, their thoughts think themselves. The\nsomething evocative for you may be poetry, history, philosophy, the sciences, or moral\nsciences, i. e. the progress of mankind. Some people who go to sleep over a volume will be\ninterested by a review which they think more condensed or better within their reach. Read\nreviews if they help you to think, that is to say if they leave in your mind images that will go on\nliving when you have forgotten where they came from; read a Shakespeare calendar at the rate\nof four lines a day, if Shakespeare quotations have on you the magic influence they have on\nsome people; read algebra, read the lives of great inventors or of great businessmen, read \nthat\nkind of books which you and nobody else know to be thought-productive for you.\nSome people get more poetry out of ten lines of classical Thomson than out of the whole of\nShelley \nbecause they first read those ten lines in childhood or in a peculiarly receptive mental\ncondition. In the same way, there may be a deeper source of romanticism in the brave\nmelancholy of a seventeenth century minuet, than in a Wagner opera. Nobody can think our\nthoughts for us, and nobody can tell us what will act as dew or sun on our thinking. The book\nthat makes us think is the book we cannot shut again after we have read one page, because we\nare entranced by what "

Have you ever analyzed what has been going on\nin your mind when you have been pleased with a lecture or a concert? Sometimes you may\nhave enjoyed following the argument or the music with more than usual clarity; oftener the\nspeech or the motif have given a chance to some lurking activity deep in you and, during an\nhour, you have been at your most personal. The Art of Thinking is merely the art of being that,\nas easily and as frequently as possible.\nNever read a book for the style. Newman’s biographies say that he used to read \nMansfield\nPark\n \nevery year for that, for the style. Newman, himself a master of infallible English, must have\nbeen sensible of the exquisite quality of Jane Austen’s language, but he was too much above\nmere words or mere elegance to care for what people call the style of an author, that is to say\nthe gestures of his expression. So ought we to be if we do not wish to fall to the level of the\npedant dealing in mere words and whose masterpiece can only be a cento. A decided attitude in\nthis respect will place us at once among the group of the virile people with whom the substance\nof things is all-important. What a man means, where it tends to, and what use it will be to us\nand to our fellow-beings is what we want to know. If the Christian habit of seeing everything\nsub specie æternitatis\n raises this attitude to the finality and charity that cannot belong to the\nmerely intellectual order, we shall be gainers.\nAnd what books should we so read?\nThe principle which has never failed to confer superiority on a man’s thinking activity is the\nwell-worn precept: DO NOT READ GOOD BOOKS—life is too short for that—ONLY READ\nTHE BEST. This simple recipe is as infallible as good air and good food are in physical hygiene.\nYet, it is a fact that nineteen out of twenty modern people quake away from it. “Masterpieces\nagain,” they groan, “the \nÆneid\n, the \nDivina Commedia\n, \nParadise Lost\n, we have heard that\nbefore: rather be ordinary than bored.”\nThe notion that masterpieces are boresome school-books interpreted by dull teachers, or\nexamination stuff, is a marvellous product of education. Ignorance is assuredly less deadly, for\nit can \ncreate no such inferiority complex as the school-boy’s notion of his lack of kinship with\nthe best literature. But this phantasm can easily be exorcised if we modify the above principle\nto: ONLY READ WHAT GIVES YOU THE GREATEST PLEASURE.\nIn the past century there lived in London a clerk of the retiring disposition behooving a man\nof little means, yet with a turn for the brilliant in civilization, especially for the theatre, for\nbeautiful actresses, for talent and elegance. This man was a playgoer of course, but, in his\nleisure hours in the day-time, he would read plays, plays of all times and all countries, plays of\nany description, provided they gave him pleasure. No reader ever placed his own enjoyment\nmore decidedly before any other consideration. We know his impressions, we can hardly be\nbetter informed about the mental background of anybody than about this absolute dilettante.\nUniquely by his untiring application to pleasing himself and by his delight in analyzing his\npleasure, this man achieved no mean originality. It is evident that, had he compelled himself to\nread famous sermons, as many of his contemporaries still did, he would have made his life not\nonly less enjoyable but useless. His name was Charles Lamb. When we look into the kind of\nliterature he used to read, we discover it was the pink of dramatic literature, and the prejudice\nagainst perfection left on us by the defects of teaching or teachers is so strong that\nimmediately our chin falls and we know the familiar impression of disgust.\nFor all that, Lamb had a superb time all his life reading his sixteenth century dramatists, a\nmuch \nbetter time than trash, unhampered by any inferiority complex, can ever give even us.\nA few years ago I travelled from Montreal down to Boston in a Pullman car which, strange\nto say, never contained more than three passengers till we reached our destination. Opposite\nme sat a McGill girl—a junior I inferred from her conversation with two other girls who were\nseeing her off. On the other side of the aisle sat a young man, one of those handsome, perfectly\nwell-tailored American youths, so attractive that you are willing to ascribe genius to them as\nwell as a host of minor perfections. This demi-god was reading. The McGill girl looked across at\nhim for some time till their eyes met. “Reading?” she half queried, after an interval of mute\npresentation leading to a simultaneous smile. “Yes,” a very uncultivated voice answered, “what\nI want is a love story with a kid in it and lots of deviltry in him.” The book was handed across\nthe aisle and the girl began to read. The voice had been an anti-climax and so, evidently, was\nthe book, yet the girl read on, skimming and skipping. After a while my professorial conscience\nsmote me and bending over the love-and-kid-story I whispered: “Have you ever read \nVanity\nFair\n?” The girl looked up, flushed a little and answered: “Dickens?”—“No,” I said, “Thack\n. . .”—“Oh! Thackeray, of course! No, it was not on our list.”\nWhat would I not have given to have \nVanity Fair\n in my valise, open it at random and watch\nthe girl’s delight at Becky Sharp’s introduction to Sir Pitt’s town-house and to his immortal\ncharwoman!\n“You have never read \nVanity Fair\n which is a wonderfully interesting book,” I said, “and\nyou waste \nan hour on a kid-and-love-story which bores you to death.”\nThe girl certainly was bored to death but she was not convinced. As long as masterpieces\nappear as books “which are on our list,” trash is sure to be preferred. Better be bored by it than\nexcited by great books.\nAssignments, examination papers and the commentaries of pedants are largely responsible\nfor this. For, the moment a great book is not supposed to be one, it recovers at once its original\nvalue as entrancing reading. Another train incident once gave me a tangible proof of this fact. I\nwas in the Paris to Orléans train. Opposite me an intelligent-looking but countrified man was\nsorting papers. In the corner, on my side of the compartment, his little daughter, a child of\ntwelve in black, was reading a square little book also habited in black canvas by some amateur\nbook-binder. I never saw anybody read like that. It seemed as if the old-fashioned but pretty\nand dainty little figure were trying to lose itself in that book. In time my curiosity about a book\nthat could be read with such intensity became irresistible. I made a brief feint of talking with the\nfather and then suddenly turned to the little girl and asked: “What are you reading so\ndelightedly?” The eager little face looked up, summoned, as it were, from far-away regions.\n“\nMonsieur, c’est l’Histoire Romaine\n” (brief pause) “\net je vais arriver à Jules César!\n”—“How\ndo you know you are coming to Julius Cæsar?”—“Oh! I have read this book many times.”\nI have never forgotten the emphasis on: “\net je vais arriver à Jules César!\n” No prospect of\nChristmas, \ngraduation, first European trip, or \ndébut\n, ever produced emphasis of that quality. I\nvisualized the background in an instant: a farm on the windy plain of wheatfields between long\nstrips of grape vines, the \nsalle\n with its big mantelpiece; on the side ledge of this, below the\nancestral powder-horns, the tiny library of three or four musty prayer-books, a gardening book,\na cook-book, a surveyor’s manual, a Family Lawyer, a Larousse \nDictionary\n, a few old almanacs\nand, in the far-away corner, the little black canvas \nHistoire Romaine\n. In a modern library of\nfiction or magazines the square squat volume would have been as forbidding to a child as a\nblack old monk. Next to the Lawyer’s or Surveyor’s stuff, Roman History resumed its glamour\nand Julius Cæsar became once mor"

None of the inferior stuff to which our children are\ntreated, while we look on powerless, can ever give them the feeling of elation, nay, the\namusement which great books naturally produce.\nSo, if you want to be vitalized into the power of thinking real thoughts, and if you want\nnever to know one dull instant while reading, do what has been done by the best specimens of\nmankind since there have been books, resolutely leave out whatever is not of the best.

No indeed, for nothing helps thought like \nhic et nunc\n questions, and if\nyou do not belong to your own time what time can you belong to? We should read modern\npoets and modern novelists and follow art in its most advanced manifestations. There must\nhave been towards 1840 suspicious old Londoners who refused to read the \nPickwick Papers\nbecause the book was so unlike Mr. Addison’s \nSpectator\n. These old fogeys were losers. It\nwould be as foolish to-day to ignore Mr. Sinclair Lewis or Mr. Arnold Bennett, even if we\nsuspect that, in eighty years, they will not appear like the Dickenses of the early twentieth\ncentury. On the other hand, if you try to keep up with the industrialized literary production of\nto-day you will be swamped and lost. Is there no way of making a selection?\nThere are dozens of ways, but here is an easy recipe. Nobody can twit you with an\naffectation of indifference to the present time if you leave out books which you find are\nforgotten three months, \nthat is to say, twelve short weeks, after their publication. Do not read\nthose. You will be surprised to see how few there will be left to read. People do not realize that\nthe feverish excitement often produced on the publication of many books, and which the\ninnocent public can hardly resist, is entirely commercial and artificially created by publishers.\nThey imagine that the book itself does it all. But the book does not do it, and the publisher\ncannot do it longer than a week or two. When ten more weeks have put their dead weight on\nthe little excitement it is more than forgotten. Draw up a list of the American writers whose\nworks published several years ago are still on the shelves where the eye and hand occasionally\ntravel. Those are the ones it would be unforgivable to desert, even for far superior reading, but\nyou will see how few they are. Notoriety, high as it is above mere publicity, is still many degrees\nbelow fame. If a man reproaches you for ignoring books that have not made their author famous\nhe is speaking from publishers’ blurbs and ought to be listened to accordingly.\nA\nLL\n that has been said above applies to literature, and literature, especially the higher kind of\npoetry which ought to be the staple of every cultivated reader, certainly provides a man with\nthe most accessible thought he needs. However, literature is not our only field. Philosophy, the\nsciences, contemporary history and what are called the moral sciences, all put in our way\nexplanations of the world and of man which are eminently thought-productive. In fact, they lead\nby a straight way to generalizations which are thought reduced to its most portable form. Now,\nit is true that philosophy, history, and \nthe sciences have, as well as literature, their classics\nwhich cannot be ignored. Plato or Darwin cannot be absent from our library. Yet, it is especially\nin that domain that it is not only permissible but imperative to look for the most up-to-date\ninformation, acquired through the most modern methods. The history of the past interests us\nonly in so far as it illuminates the history of the present. The politics and economics of to-day,\nthe characters and ideas of contemporary leaders, the tendencies of modern parties are what we\nmust endlessly revert to. We must be able to take out a map of the world and read frontiers and\ntheir problems like a book.\nThe same can be said of philosophy. The position \nto-day\n of the eternal problems means\nmore to us than their solutions even in the great past. Religious questions ought to be studied\nin their latest exponents. So, of course, should plans for social reforms. So, above all, should\nthe philosophy of the sciences.\nGreat books, great men, great problems and great doctrines, great facts and their lessons, all\nthat is opposed to \n’tits détails\n cannot but result in high thought. The busier we are, the more\nsevere our selection should be. Many men absorbed in business show such a rare quality of\nculture that we are surprised at it. The reason invariably is partly because hard work and even\nthe weariness it leaves carry a nobility with them, but also because there is no room in such\nlives for inferior mental occupation.\nParents anxious to give their children the best of everything should as resolutely pack away\ntrash of all kinds from their reach as if it were poison. It is \nsurprising that intelligent people\nanxious to do their best should not realize that no book ought to be left in the nursery that is\ninferior to \nRobinson Crusoe\n, \nThe Arabian Nights\n, or Perrault’s \nFairy Tales\n. You do not wish\nyour children to be too clever? You do not want them to be like the twelve year old mature little\nwomen of the eighteenth century? Open the window, listen for one instant to the young\npeople’s conversation out on the lawn this week-end, and you will be reassured. Only too glad\nwill you be if you can teach them to prefer distinction to vulgarity when they see it. Joseph de\nMaistre tells us that his mother used to recite Racine’s verses to him when he was a little child\nand “his ears, having thus early drunk in such a nectar, ever after rejected sour stuff.” A rare\nresult!\nd) \nHow to read in order to think\nThe title of this chapter would have sounded incomprehensible to an Ancient or even to a\nman of the classical ages. To them reading meant thinking. So, once more I must insist that the\nnotion—and the habit—of reading as we absent-mindedly listen to the soporiferous brook\nbelong to a period of mental decadence. The consequence is that they must be eliminated from\nthe background of anybody anxious to think. I have been tempted many times to annex\nSchopenhauer’s maxim in his \nParalipomena\n: “Do not read, think!” or to transform it into:\nNEVER READ, ALWAYS STUDY. A harsh saying? Not if we realize that we should study\nnothing that does not interest us, and that studying only applies to the most enjoyable way of\nextracting from that what will interest us the most. In precisely the same way does an artist\nstudy a beautiful face instead \nof merely glancing at it. We can never repeat often enough that\nnothing intellectual can be achieved against the will of Minerva, that is to say, in a field that\ndoes not attract us. Working in our vein, without a sense of effort, and, on the contrary, with a\nsense of ease and freedom, is the fundamental condition of a healthy mental operation. Do not\ntackle algebra when you are attracted by comedies, and if farces attract you more than\ncomedies leave comedies alone and study farces. Only STUDY them. You will not have done so\nlong before discovering that there is more and deeper pleasure in studying \nle Misanthrope\n than\nin rehearsing \nScapin\n.\nThis being laid down as a principle, how should you read? As you please. If you please\nyourself by reading fast, read fast; if you read slowly and do not feel like reading faster, read\nslowly. Pascal does say that we are apt to read too "

      "chapter_text": "fast or too slowly, but he only blames an\nexcess. (Levity is foolish to read too fast, but seriousness will be a gainer in many cases if it\nreads briskly.) Montaigne complains of a formal way of reading. “My thoughts go to sleep\nwhen they are seated,” he says, “so they and I walk.” Honest industry merely jogs along,\ncuriosity flies on Mercury’s pinions. Passionate reading not only flies, it skips, but it only does\nso because it can choose, which is a high intellectual achievement. How do you read the time-\ntable? You skip till you come to your place, then you are indifferent to the whole world and\nengrossed by your train, its departure, arrival, and connections. The same thing with a map\nwhich a motorist lends the anxious cyclist at the cross-roads. The latter’s whole soul is in his\nreading. The same thing with a financial \ntip in a letter which a friend is waiting for you to return.\nThe same thing with any formula for the production of the philosopher’s stone. Whatever we\nread from intense curiosity gives us the model of how we should always read. Plodding along\npage after page with an equal attention to each word results in attention to mere words.\nAttention to words never produces thought, but very promptly results in distractions, so that\nan honourable effort is brought to nought by its own ill-advised conscientiousness.\nA friend of mine, a celebrated French writer dealing in very serious subjects, has always\nseemed to me the typical active reader. He writes his books for himself and prepares them for\nhis own pleasure. If he scents the least danger of boredom he studies the suspicious object at\nlong range, as a sea-captain observes an iceberg, and reports about it hurriedly and\ndisgustedly. If, on the contrary, a subject, or an aspect of a subject, charms him, he approaches\nit tenderly and carries on a sort of exquisite dialogue with it. Not with you. You and I do not\ncount much. We are admitted to the library in which the author bustles from his table to the\nshelves or back, we overhear the humorous, admiring, or impatient remarks he utters as one\nvolume after another is pressed into the service of the then favourite idea, but all that we get,\napart from this reflected pleasure, is an occasional wink when our unnecessary presence\nchances to be remembered. A delightful writer, yes, but a perfect reader. He never reads slowly;\nhe never reads dully, he never reads sleepily. Like Montaigne, on his legs all the time, ready to\nfly from the book, as we do from a bore, the moment \nthe book ceases to be fascinating. There is\na gulf between that way of reading and what we have been given to understand is the serious\nmethod, viz. what du Bellay called “Keeping the chair warm,” but Henri Brémond is right.\nDoes this apply to all kinds of books? Should a poet be read as \nWho’s Who\n? Sometimes.\nTischendorf once read the New Testament like that while two Roman prelates tried to keep him\nfrom the Ms. with cheerful Italian chatter. But it is evident that it cannot be done often. Poetry,\nlike a queen, sets the pace and we proceed as she dictates. So does the sententious style of\nwisdom in any language. Obviously we must make a distinction between what we read for our\ninformation and what we read for our formation, between what we want for our use and what we\nneed for our development. History, whether it be the history of politics, literature, art,\nphilosophy, religions or the sciences, facts and the conclusions from facts, whatever is best\nsummed up in encyclopædias or easily reduced to text-books, can never hope to be read better\nthan as a snob reads \nWho’s Who\n concerning a duchess or an actress. No attention to the book,\nno thought of the author, but the whole mind engrossed by the matter, and striving to annex it\nforever within a few moments. Information books, even Gibbon’s or Macaulay’s or Mommsen’s\nhistories, have a right to our respect, but they are tools and ought to be used as such. If we\nonly need to read twenty pages let us not think ourselves conscientious—but rather merely\npassive—if we read thirty. If we only read to refresh our memory concerning a subject by\nmerely glancing at a chapter we have mastered before, do not let us \nwaste time by re-reading\nevery word of it, or, if possible, let us substitute our notes for it. Boys are told to mind their\nbook. They ought also to be told to think and not read, or to read with one eye shut and the\nother only half opened, so that they will read in their memory while the book will act as a mere\nprompter. Why read a whole page if two lines give you a sufficient idea of it?\nMany books can even be read from their Table of Contents. The title gives you of course a\ngeneral idea of their subject. Ask yourself how \nyou\n would treat it, what your main line of\nargument would be. Refer to the Table of Contents. If it is not one of those farcical affairs which\nsay “Chapter X: Emerson, Chapter XI: Nietzsche,” and of which publishers as well as authors\nought to be deeply ashamed, a quick and interested perusal of the seven or eight pages will tell\nyou at once what you can expect from the new-comer, where you ought to look for the\ninformation he has to give, and where you are sure to dissent from him. Reading in that way\ndoes not put you to sleep, it does not leave on your mind shadows of ideas that you would be\nglad to be rid of, it keeps you wide-awake as if the book were a living author which, as much as\npossible, it ought to be.\nBooks are not well made. If their authors were anxious to be useful, they would develop\nsome imagination in trying to serve the reader instead of strutting to him. They often realize\nquite clearly that the statistics or the diagram which they are themselves using would appeal\nmuch more directly to the reader than page after page expanded from them. But they are not\nindependent enough or serviceable enough to give them to us in their nudeness. \nPéguy was\nregarded as eccentric because he used typographical artifices to make his meaning clearer, and\nuntil recently a semi-colon at the end of a paragraph was considered a heresy, even if it was full\nof significance. Too copious a table of contents is discouraged by publishers as injurious to\nthe book and over-helpful to the reader. The whole concept of a book ought to be modified.\nIn many cases you will get more out of a secretary’s or a friend’s analysis of a book than\nout of direct reading. For you will be questioning, which is the virile intellectual action, and the\nother man will be alert. Busy people who have recourse to this quick way often surprise us by\nthe amount of their knowledge. King Edward VII, who never read anything, was however up-to-\ndate in two or three literatures: shaving, dressing, smoking, he would ask questions of\nintelligent people or have significant bits read out to him, a truly royal highway to knowledge.\nLa Bruyère alludes to it when he says: “The children of Kings know everything without having\nlearned anything.” Oral teaching is the most human and the most profitable of all. The effort\nmade in America to create “community learning,” or the growing habit of putting students in\ninformal contact with thinkers is in the right direction. People are sometimes surprised at the\nresults obtained by what they call “mere crammers.” Those results are due to the superiority of\nmethods making the student’s mind more active than it has ever been. Two students “quizzing”\neach other the week before an examination may, for the first time in their lives, know what\nmental alertness means. If crammers’ methods were used in the regular schools where\nsleepiness is often canonized as broad general culture there would be no need of cramming\nestablishments.\nAt twenty, a man taught according to these methods ought to know the essentials of even\nthe encyclopædic knowledge of to-day. He ought to have given himself or bought himself from\nsome specialist as good a memory as he can ever get. He ought also to have acquired the habit\nof making notes without which Sainte-Beuve says people read as they eat cherries. If this way\nof approaching books should become popular, as in time it must inevitably be, mankind would\ncease to consist of an immense majority of minors.\nT\nHIS\n decisive, somewhat aggressive way of asking a volume: “What have you to declare?”\nleads in a brisk way to information. But formation or culture cannot be reached by the same\nhigh-handed methods. They require more time, more love, and an admixture of criticism and\nhumility "

      "chapter_text": "which is more easily discovered through experience than defined in words.\nWriters dealing with the soul in its subtler and more recondite operations, poets, dramatists,\nmoralists, psychologists (even using such fiction as \nAdolphe\n), religious or spiritual authors all\ncreate round themselves a zone of respect of which we are soon aware. The tone and gait of\ntheir very first sentence warn us at once that here the \nsturm und drang\n method cannot be used.\nComprehension must take the place of mere intelligence, which means sympathy, reverence,\nand no haste. A medievalist may know all that can be known about the Cistercians, \nVézelay, and\nplain-song, and yet raise his eyebrows on hearing a less erudite person say that some celestial\nantiphons to the Blessed Virgin or the mysterious light under an arch joining two uneven vaults\nmake him realize the spiritual life of twelfth century monks. It takes multiform experiences of\nmusical or architectural enjoyment, added to a sense of spiritual beauty, to understand a\nstatement of such quality.\nOn the other hand the words in which it is expressed may enter an intellect and stay there,\nfashioning and dilating it till they are understood. A rhythm, an image, a thought, thus\ncontained in a few words, may be enough for a meditation which the incidents of life may\nsuspend but not interrupt. I have never forgotten, and certainly I have never exhausted, one\nverse of a ballad I once heard a few poor children singing outside my window:\nUn jour l’amour nous blesse.\nThese children’s voices were careless and mocking like life itself, yet there was a touch of\ncompassion in their insistence on the longs in the iambs which once in the ear would not go\nout of the soul. Of course there is an abyss between the human language conveying mere\ninformation and poetry of this kind. In order to be fully understood poetry has to be re-thought\nand felt over again, and this cannot be done by any mind without something personal being\nadded to what we are pondering. When technicians speak of “Creative Criticism” they mean\nthis reconstruction of a great thought. Creative criticism ranks with the highest kind of literature\nand with the higher kind of thought which we are to study in Part IV.\ne) \nComprehending and Critical Reading\nWhatever we read we must first comprehend and, when we have comprehended, criticize.\nComprehension is the first and essential step in reading, but a vast majority of readers do\nnot care to take it. They understand or think they understand what is obvious: the rest they\nregard as a mistake or a freak of the writer. I once tried a number of readers with that passage in\nAurora Leigh\n in which Mrs. Browning defines philosophy as “sympathy with God” (II, 293).\nOnly one of them seemed to think there was anything arresting in this phrase. The others\nvisibly were carried away by the rhythm or dazzled by the superficial abstraction of the\npassage. When invited to fix their attention on this “sympathy with God,” most of them first\nsaid it was far-fetched but perfectly intelligible. But, being asked what these perfectly\nintelligible words meant, they had to admit they could not tell, and only two or three wished to\nhear. None ventured on any conjecture or tried to hit upon one. Their attitude was the\nuneducated one implying that if people use any except everyday language, they ought not to\nhope to be understood.\nThere is an abyss between people who want a poem to be as accessible as the morning\npaper and people in possession, or in search of, culture. Scholars often spend years over a\nretrieved fragment of a lost writer and read into it or infer from it the most interesting\ninformation. I have seen Angellier refuse after an hour’s effort to give up an obscure passage\nof Herbert and succeed in making it appear laden with meaning yet clear to minds used to the\nrich language of poetry or philosophy. Certainly the \nhabit of French lycée professors to devote\na whole two hours to twenty lines of Seneca is first-rate intellectual training. Foreign visitors\nwho, at first, wonder at this method ultimately appreciate it, and boys or girls compelled to use\nit are never slow in recognizing its merits. If you happen to know two languages, try your hand\nat really intelligent and artistic translation, were it only of four lines every day. The habit of\ncomplete comprehension will be a magnificent reward.\nToo slow, you say, and too hard. But are we not endeavoring to think?\nCriticizing is only another aspect of the effort to comprehend. The word in its etymology\nmeans “to judge,” and in fact we think of a critic as a competent, not a carping, judge. The\ncapacity to resist oral or printed affirmations, to have one’s own opinion about an idea, a poem,\na doctrine or a work of art, and to see it clearly enough to give it forcible expression is an\nexception. Most people suspend their judgment till somebody else has expressed his own and\nthen they repeat it. Common parlance alludes to this weakness in the frequently heard phrase:\nPEOPLE DO NOT THINK. These four words describe the mental cowardice or sluggishness\nwhich makes sheep of most people. Such passivity cannot be too early counteracted. If it is\ndone methodically and intelligently it will never produce over-confidence, only the youthful\nmind will acquire strength during the all-important formative period.\nTeachers should attach the greatest value to the school exercise called literary analysis. The\nstudent is placed face to face with a literary piece worth while and examines its construction.\nThis means \nreading and reading it over again, grasping the main idea which gave it birth, and\nobserving how this idea is sustained throughout its development. The first time a boy or girl\ndoes this without any school preoccupation and realizes that a moderate amount of attention is\nenough to accomplish it he becomes an adult at once. Many remember the wonderful sensation\nof unexpected growth ever after. History, the estimation of a great period or of a famous man,\nthe progress or regress of nations can give a teacher even a better chance than literature, more\nremote from the student’s early experience of life. Testing a proverb or an opinion generally\nsupposed to be right is equally useful.\nThe student must acquire the habit—which both Descartes and Schopenhauer regard as\nthe fundamental philosophical attitude—not to receive anything as true or beautiful, but to\nconsider everything \nas a problem\n. Mr. Chesterton also advises us to look at familiar objects till\nthey seem strange, that is to say till we actually see them, instead of being suggested how to\nsee them. Probably he remembers an experience which few people have not had. We are in the\ntrain or riding in a motor-car. The landscape, especially by moonlight, is unfamiliar and we note\nits characteristics with the interest of novelty. Suddenly some object makes us realize that we\nhave been mistaken, the section in our vision was perfectly familiar: we have only been\ndeceived by the idea that we were elsewhere. At once, hills, trees and cottages shrink to a\nsmaller size and we look at them with the contempt of habit. Our whole outlook on life and\nthought is vitiated in that way till we devote time enough and energy \nenough to a\nreëxamination of things as they are.\nWe should be given the habit of critical attention so that our first contact with anything\nworth the effort will give us as keen an impression as we are capable of. Do you not remember\nhearing the name of some foreign writer, Gorki, for instance, mentioned by friends long before\nyou had an opportunity to read any of his writings? Your desire became keener in\nconsequence. One day you chanced, in a magazine, on a fragment of the writer’s diary, twenty\npages on the return of Spring, with a beautiful narrative of a child’s death, and an old bishop’s\nvisit. Each sentence, each word impressed, because of the intensity of your wish to make the\nmost of these short twenty pages; there was, over the whole chapter, a mysterious charm like\nthat of music or perhaps, perfumes. For a long time you refused to read anything else of Gorki’s,\nfearing to break the spell and cherishing this chapter like a talisman. You realized that people\nwho had read every volume of Gorki did not \npossess\n him as you did.\nCriticism, when we read, think or feel in that way, is sure to be what it ought always to be,\nviz. the balance of what we should bow to with what we feel doubtful of. We do not insult great\nwriters or"

      "chapter_text": " great thinkers by submitting them to this test, but the reverse. Have you ever seen a\npainter, a real artist, watch in a gallery the masterpieces of his craft? What a difference between\nhim and the effusive crowd elbowing him. His eyes, as he takes in detail after detail, have the\nhardness customary to a painter’s glance; nothing escapes them. But suddenly the artist shuts\nhis eyes and you know he is striving to project himself, so to speak, into the \nperfect picture. Do\nnot be afraid to let a student accustomed to Shakespeare demur at calling Racine (who first\nwrote his plays in prose) a poet, if further examination makes him realize the perfection of the\nFrench dramatist as a painter of the passions.\nComprehension is criticism, and criticism or judgment is a mere synonym for THOUGHT.\nf) \nHow to read the Newspaper\nSome people treat the newspaper with absurd respect, reading it through as if every syllable\nmattered. Others speak of it with contempt: “There never is anything in the newspaper: you\nwaste time reading it.” Others again—few in number—armed with a red pencil and big scissors\nsit beside a pile of newspapers which they treat unceremoniously indeed. Half the sheets are\nflung aside while the rest are eagerly but quickly gone over, the red pencil every now and then\nzig-zagging through a column. In less than an hour the seven or eight newspapers have been\ngone through and the red-marked pages alone strew the table, sofa and piano. Then the big\nscissors come into play. In a few minutes the clippings are heaped up apart, a neat little sheaf,\nwhile the litter of crumpled sheets is kicked aside till the maid can attend to it. Then the reader\nwill be seen slowly going over his clippings, thinking. Nothing can look more different from the\nordinary newspaper reader’s expression than this pensive brow. A few moments afterwards the\nclippings will have disappeared, carefully tucked away in various dossiers.\nYou may see the same man again later in the day, thoughtful and absorbed. His mind is\nrunning over the things he has read in the morning. You may meet him again in the evening. A\ncircle of interested \nbut silent listeners surround him. He is an unaffected, lucid and forcible\nspeaker. Every now and then somebody asks him a question, one of those questions which\ncauses everybody else to wish they could answer it. He does so, in a clear way, bringing in\nfacts which you remember catching a glimpse of in the morning paper, but which you thought\nimmaterial, whereas on his lips they actually give you the key to developments of vast\nimportance: “This man thinks” you say to yourself.\nWhat helps him to think? Simply taking the daily newspaper for what it really is: a page of\nhistory. Look for history in those ill-written sheets, you will think the thoughts of history; look\nfor society, business or sporting news, you will talk the language of the tea-table, the stock-\nmarket or the field, but you will not think.\n—“I see. You advise us to treat the newspaper as a school-book.”\n“Precisely. Few school-books can sum up as many events of world-wide importance as\nthose which day after day have filled the newspapers since 1914. There never were such\npolitical dramas as those we can now follow. After Europe slowly regaining its balance, Asia is\ngiving us a spectacular lesson. Meanwhile America, compelled by necessities of all sorts, is\nslowly being driven to the forefront from which she has long been shrinking. Other ages have\ntaken generations to produce the mutations we can now see in a year. Indeed the newspaper is\nricher than any text-book, and blind indeed must be the people who daily glance at it without\nrealizing that if the quality of our thought depends upon that of the images we garner in, here \nis\nan incomparable chance. But blind are indeed most people, for the so-called wise and the\nfoolish agree in speaking contemptuously of what they all read unintelligently.”\nThe two foregoing sections have been an effort to describe\n1—The preparation of our lives and minds for higher kind of images.\n2—The storing in of those images.\nWe now come to:\n3—The elaboration of these acquisitions in the mind.\n\n3. ELABORATION OF DATA IN THE MIND\na) \nGoing over our knowledge\nThe son of the famous French painter Cazin, himself an artist of note, once told me that his\nfather used to take him on professional rambles through the country. Every now and then the\ntwo men would stop for a few moments, sometimes only one minute; then, turning their backs\non the landscape, they tested each other’s recollection of the values registered during this brief\ninterval. The older man’s capacity for taking in and remembering was extraordinary. Sometimes\nhe could, after months, prove that half-tints indistinguishable to the average vision were still\nclear in his memory. Cazin had learned this practice from Lecoq de Boisbaudran, who taught it\nto many other artists, Rodin among the number.\nWhat artists do with color values we all can do with ordinary data. The test, or the thought\nof the test, makes our mental energy tenfold. Maroncelli, in his additions to Silvio Pellico’s \nMie\nPrigioni\n, relates how Pellico and himself being deprived of books, pen and paper, during the\nearly months of their captivity, easily managed to give food to their minds. They would,\nsometimes singly, sometimes together, go over what they remembered, one day about history,\nanother day about literature, another day again about philosophy. Supplementing each other it\nwas surprising how much more they could remember than they had imagined. Gradually their\nknowledge, from being a useless chaos, became orderly \nand ready. Their minds simultaneously\ngrew freer. They could, without pen and ink, compose long poems some of which lived\nexclusively in their creators’ minds till at last freedom came. It is easy to infer from Maroncelli’s\nwords that the two men thrown back on primitive methods, no doubt also helped by that\nexaltation of primitive sentiments which prisoners in the Bolshevik gaols have similarly\nrecorded, were nearer to their souls and in fuller possession of their powers than they had ever\nbeen.\nWe all can go through the same process, and no practice can occupy empty hours or half-\nhours to better advantage. The curious admixture of yearning and antipathy with which most of\nus think of what we have learned at school comes almost invariably from one cause. When we\nleft school we felt near knowledge, which was a joy, but since then we have seldom found that\nwe were any nearer to it, and the consciousness of this creates a phantasm with the usual\nimpression of inferiority. Let any chance offer to complete what never was entirely achieved\nand the inferiority complex is promptly exorcised, and we experience exhilaration. Many a parent\nhelping a child with his \nCæsar\n has been delighted to find, and easily enjoy, elegance where it\nhad been merely glimpsed many years before. Should \nCæsar\n have been read over again at\ncollege the result would have been the same, but \nCæsar\n was not read at college: good-bye was\nsaid to it at school, and it was left as an embryo of pleasure till an unexpected chance occurred.\nThe same can be said of practically all that we have learned or skimmed through at school.\nGo mentally over what you remember, completing it, when necessary, by a few minutes’\nreading at home, and you will promptly know what education means. Was there no book by\nwhich you were especially impressed at the period of life when impressions were deepest\nbecause there were so few? Is there not a poem you remember hearing or learning and which,\nsince that time, has remained in your memory as the embodiment of poetry? Has there been\nnone since? I once saw a man take out of his pocket-book a neatly folded clipping: it was a\npoem from one of the magazines which this gentleman carried with him like a talisman. There\nmust be some poems that you too never can forget. When you have a few minutes shut your\neyes and enjoy one of them as you may enjoy any dear memory. Many a drab hour in the train,\nat an uninteresting hotel, or on shipboard, has been brightened up by this habit as a room is by\na bouquet.\nIn the same way, we all remember moments, happy crises which were the peaks in our\nmental life, introducing strength where weakness used to prevail, or calmness where there had\nbeen no rest. We can recapture the feeling of those moments. When it enters our soul every\nfibre in us vibrates again as champagne sparkles to the touch of a"

      "chapter_text": " crumb. We imagined we were\nmerely going over a chronology of our own actions, and suddenly we find ourselves in the\nproductive portion of our personality.\nWe can also be profitably occupied with the recollection of past travelling that is worth\nremembering. People nowadays travel too much and too early. One nail drives out the other,\nand you hear philosophers \nof thirteen state the fact with perfect indifference. Apparently less\nlucky people are more fortunate. Charlotte Brontë, born within fifty miles of the sea, saw it for\nthe first time when she was twenty-four, but the sight overwhelmed her, and a year later she\nwould allude to the experience as another might allude to first love. There is something\nexquisite in remembering our first consciousness of being abroad, hearing a mysterious\nlanguage, feeling far away, a little less confident, and a little lost. The first thing that an Umbrian\ntown, a pine-surrounded cove in the Mediterranean, or the Arizona desert, first seen in the\nsolemn dawn, told us ought never to be forgotten.\nArtistic beauty should also be cherished. Why count the impacts of the track and calculate\nthe speed of the train when we could have a perfect half-hour remembering a room or two in the\nLouvre? With a little practice you can conjure up the \nVenus de Milo\n or the \nWedding of Saint\nCatherine\n clearly enough to feel once more the fringe of impression which these works of art\nhave left on you. Give yourself a little time, and the serenity of Greece or the luminous grace of\nItaly will be felt in turn. Without any effort you will not merely be going through a mental\nexercise but reaching the condition in which a Ruskin writes about art.\nGreat lives or great deeds can people any solitude. The lives of the Saints, above all, the life\nof Christ, have filled the existence of thousands of thinkers. French spiritual writers when\ndescribing this meditation use a remarkable phrase: \ns’entretenir de la vie des Saints\n, which\nmeans both carrying on a \ndialogue with one’s self about those noble souls and keeping one’s\nself alive by it. No word could be of a richer or more accurate psychology.\nThe ancients realized the virtue of this practice. Remember that Plutarch, who did more than\nanybody else, before the Christian writers, to make it popular, was a priest and a moralist, and\nhis stories were the illustration of his doctrine. The passion for history which characterized the\nclassical ages, and only decreased when artists took precedence over great doers of deeds, was\nfed by the admiration of exceptional individuals rather than by sheer interest in politics. In her\ncharming memoirs Madame Campan says that Madame Louise, the youngest daughter of Louis\nXV, kept her busy during several months, reading out to her the history of France, because she\nwanted to have heard it through before joining the Carmelite nuns. When she adds “only one\nheroic action was possible for this princess and she did it,” we realize that the examples of\nnobility gathered from that course of reading reacted on the resolution of this rare King’s\ndaughter. Anybody interested in the men and women without whom there would be no history,\nbut only insipid uniformity, knows that, dead as they are, there is more life in them than in the\nautomata we see walking around us. Thinking about them would be the natural impulse of most\nof us if the word highbrow or its synonyms were not terrifying a world of sheep into\nconformity. Every one of the mental exercises I have tried to describe has been not an effort but\nthe most vitalizing relaxation to whoever has given them a chance.\nb) \nReflection\nThis is what people generally call thinking. When a person is neither speaking, writing,\ngetting rid of some job, nor being spoken to, if he is also not asleep he is supposed to be\nthinking.\nReflecting is something more active. I said above that Madame de Maintenon defines\nreflection as “thinking attentively of the same thing several times over.” This simplicity of\nlanguage is delightful and expresses what it means to convey quite as fully as the scientific\njargon made fashionable by the nineteenth century.\nCertainly Madame de Maintenon’s definition can be questioned, for it seems to imply mere\nrepetition whereas various aspects of one proposition are sure to appear to reflection, but it is\naccurate inasmuch as it indicates the presence in the mind of one object engrossing it.\nWe all know reflection, at first spontaneous, gradually more deliberate and conscious. The\nmoment a child is aware of fear or attraction he revolves in his little head the means of escaping\nfrom what is dreaded, or of securing what is wanted. This is done, as usual, by the presentment\nof images or sets of images showing to the mind pictures of what is likely to happen. Finally a\nsequence, a whole scenario, seems more probable than its rivals, and the intellect stops in its\nsearch after possibilities. This interruption is what we call a decision, as the picture finally\nretained sets our volitional powers in action. On the whole the object of reflection is invariably\nthe discovery of something satisfying to the mind which was not there at the beginning of the\nsearch. There is no fundamental difference between \nthis discovery and scientific invention.\n“How did you discover the law of gravitation?” somebody once asked Newton. “By thinking\nabout it all the time,” was the answer.\nPeople are not often clear about this, because their best thinking is done when they do not\nsuppose they are thinking, and consequently the successive phases of their thought can\nseldom be reclaimed from the subconscious. But every time we succeed in glimpsing the\nsubconscious we do see the chain of images. Not infrequently we get up in the morning clear\nabout an issue which appeared doubtful when we went to bed. If we can remember the last set\nof images overnight, comparing it with the one we are now satisfied with, we have no trouble in\ndiscovering the concatenation of intermediary images.\nSo, reflection is a natural condition, but only in the excitement produced by fear or desire.\nWhen this impulse is merely superficial it produces imaginative reactions also too superficial to\nbe noted, which is our habitual mental state. If we have acquired a taste for reflection, or, as we\nsay, meditation, or if some extraneous incentive makes us anxious to acquire it, we have to fight\noff our inertness in order to think. The morning meditation of pious people is a burden to them\nas long as it depends on a book for its support and has not become personal, that is to say, in\nplain English, egotistical. Otherwise we wait for the book, or for some director, to do the\nthinking for us.\nChildren ought to be put through regular thinking exercises at school. The Montessori\nsystem arranges for intervals during which the children veil \ntheir little faces and think. Madame\nde Maintenon also recommended silent times, and the instruction I was referring to above deals\nwith the methods for turning them to the best account. This experienced woman notes that the\nSaint-Cyr girls insisted on being given the solution of all their problems—even those set in\nplay—and that “Please tell us” was more frequently on their lips than “Let me think.”\nAsk a class of thirty what is their explanation of any little subtlety interesting enough to fix\ntheir attention. Up will go most hands. Shake your head and insist on the query being answered\nin the copy-book without any of the hubbub and excitement produced by it; in a few moments\nyou will see on the more intelligent faces a smile meaning “I was going to talk like a fool and\nyou knew it,” whereas on the other faces you will see nothing at all. You will be lucky if one\nscholar does any thinking at all.\nI have seen classes positively tortured by a practice which however ought to be insisted on\nand the habit of which is soon acquired. Give the scholars a Latin text just difficult enough for\nthem not to read it at sight,—a pretty bit of Ovid, for instance,—and lay down the following\nterms:\n1) Not a single word shall be written down for forty-five minutes;\n2) During the same period the dictionary shall not be consulted, but the text will be studied,\nand puzzling phrases will be scrutinized so as to make sense from the context;\n3) At the end of the forty-five minutes the dictionary will be allowed for eight minutes;\n4) Only then, shall the translation be written down.\nI have never seen this method fail: it simply compels reflection. But bo"

      "chapter_text": "yish minds are so\naverse to it that the trial at first is an ordeal: the young fingers itch intolerably towards the\npencil and the dictionary, because the habit is to get rid of the thing as quickly as possible.\nThe average scholar hates the composition of an essay because his past experiences have\nbeen anything but pleasant. He knows that writing an essay means writing a few lines after\nwhich there will be a hideous vacancy made worse by the necessity to say something at all\ncosts. If he were taught before his first experience that not a word of an essay should be written\ndown till the whole of it is complete in the mind and \ncould be spoken in simple but clear\nlanguage\n, he would never know this degrading condition. Let him find by thinking out loud the\nsubject in hand that nothing is so fascinating as to make up one’s mind about something worth\nwhile, and that writing down the result of this investigation is of no particular importance but is\nsure to be easy, and the phantasm of an essay as a hopeless fight with vacuum will disappear\nfor ever. You can as easily dispel the phantasm of the superiority of books and of book-\nproducers by pointing out that a volume is nothing but a sequence of individual chapters thus\nprepared, and that, as La Bruyère says, you can learn how to make a book as you learn how to\nmake a clock.\nc) \nWriting as a help to thought.\nThe habit of using pen and ink in order to make up one’s mind, just described and already\nmentioned in the chapter dealing with concentration, should be preserved through life. It is\nuseful not \nonly as a help to reflection but as an important element in an all-important inventory.\nThere are many questions which we regard as vital, yet about which we are vague. God,\nimmortality, the foundation of morals, the nature and basis of happiness, love, marriage, the use\nof life, education, literary or artistic principles, what do we know about all these? So little that it\nis next to nothing. We have heard these issues mentioned so often, we have mentioned them\nourselves in so many occurrences that we gradually acquire an idea that they are familiar. But\nthis is a mere fallacy, the same under which we labor when, after long putting off our\nexamination of a practical issue—which however happens to be puzzling enough and serious\nenough to haunt us—we finally come to a decision. We then imagine that we have somehow\nbeen weighing the \npros\n and \ncons\n more than we realized, and we call our procrastination the time\nwe have taken to think. But as a matter of fact we have not been thinking at all, we have only\nbeen wishing to think. If we could add up the minutes we have devoted to a critical examination\nof what we hold, say about a future life, we should be shocked at the ridiculous sum.\nThousands of allusions from ourselves or from others to immortality do not make up a thought,\nthey only mean that immortality is an important problem which people cannot let alone. I know\na high ecclesiastical dignitary who has always wished but always postponed studying his\ncathedral which is one of the famous ones in Europe. Whenever I hear him say “my cathedral” I\nalways think: “No, you do not own that cathedral, the cathedral owns you.” So with those great\nquestions of which we \ntruly say that we are possessed without daring to hint that we possess\nthem.\nThere are in the daily press a number of writers, male and female, who make it a point to\nhave an opinion about everything. Day after day, four or five hundred words from their pens\nappear in which they express their views on an immense variety of subjects, most of them\ninteresting. An expert runs little risk of erring in estimating how much time these fellow-writers\nof his have devoted to each individual question. It can be counted in minutes rather than in\nhours. The authors have seldom referred to any literature, even to an encyclopædia, they have\nbeen satisfied with summing up their own flimsy knowledge of the data and their flimsier\nimpression of them. Yet, this is so much better than nothing that we read the articles through.\nIt would be a great beginning if we too would do that, limiting ourselves to recording what\nwe know, what we are doubtful about, and what we should like to know. It might be enough to\nplace us on the high road to knowledge, or, at any rate, understanding. Seventeenth century\npeople used to enter such meditations in a copy-book to which, from time to time, they would\nadd fresh information. To-day we take some wrapper and put in it the note which, like the parent\ncrystal in a solution, may give solidity and order to our thoughts on the subject. The results are\nsurprising.\nSeventeenth century people also used their pens with similar effect to make up their minds\nabout living men and women. These portraits were likely to be too elaborate, but they made\nobservation and criticalness a necessity, and some of them, written \nby almost unknown people,\nhave been valuable to the historian. Try the method in the interest of your nearest friends, or in\nself-defence, or from mere curiosity, and you will soon be conscious of an insight into your\nneighbors’ souls which years of passivity had never given you.\nDoes it follow that professional writers stand the best chance of thinking their best? Not\nnecessarily. I said, in Part II, that the professional writer is in danger of being a prey to many\nphantasms. Controlled sensitiveness belongs only to the very greatest. Average talent is\nconstantly hampered by over-sensitiveness. The notion that one is writing for the public, for\ncriticalness and often for misinterpretation, produces ill effects from which the person writing\nonly to help his powers of concentration is free. But this inevitable drawback is compensated\nby the vitalizing influence of composition. Even a mere journalist, if he is worth his ink, will\noften begin an article solely because he has to write it, but, in a few minutes, will enjoy the work\nbecause it sets his faculties free and gives them unexpected play. The mind is an enchanted\nspot where you are sure to be visited by fascinating apparitions as the nightly fisher on a\nmarsh is sure to see will o’ the wisps.\nThis is not all. There is no good or even passable writing, without some sort of outline\ndestined to guide the pen. While producing these sketches, entirely similar to the preparatory\nwork of an artist, the writer thinks no longer for his readers but for himself and is sure to\nproduce of his best.\nThere is a time in life when the writer is independent of his reader, whose approval he does\nnot \ndoubt, as well as of his predecessors whom he regards only as precursors, and when he\ncan sweep aside the most dangerous phantasms with a mere thrust of his pen. Fortunate are the\nwriters who, like Byron, Shelley, Barrès, and a number of the philosophers, began to publish\ntheir thoughts when still in their teens or barely out of their teens. Those are not tormented by\nthe phantasm that “all has been said.” All the great commonplaces which go on intriguing the\nworld, as they intrigue children, seem to them novelties which nobody has as yet looked in the\nface as they do. \nPereant qui ante nos nostra dixerunt!\n Whatever they think seems to them\nworthy of expression and even of publication. And they are largely right, since no two\nmusicians can ever play the same piece identically. As they proceed in life their youthful\nthoughts solidified in print surround them like a body-guard and protect them against doubts\nor diffidence. A man like Barrès who was only separated from timidity by exceeding confidence\nmight have consumed his powers in irony if he had not begun at nineteen to regard all his\nthoughts as poetry.\nd) \nPreserving one’s thoughts\nTo keep no track of what one learns or thinks is as foolish as to till and seed one’s land with\ngreat pains, and when the harvest is ripe turn one’s back upon it and think of it no more.\nSome people have extraordinarily retentive memories and can do with a minimum of notes,\nbut phenomenal exceptions do not count. Most men who have made a name in literature,\npolitics or business have found it necessary to have a paper memory and those who have\nthought it possible to dispense with \nthe drudgery of forming such a one have inevitably some\nday rued it. For humorists who define memory as the faculty enabling us to forget only\nemphasize an unfortunate truth. Striking facts or vivid impressions which we imagine can never\nbe effaced from our consciousness do not survive i"

Anybody whom his fate compels to use his brain actively soon realizes that\nhe cannot afford to lose any of his resources, and he devises some plan for stopping waste. If\nhe is rich enough he buys the assistance of a trained secretary. If not, he reads the books in\nwhich the methods of erudition or those of business (they are almost alike) are expounded, or\nhe invents devices of his own. We marvel at the immense knowledge which some writers\npossess of what used to be called foreign politics but should be called at present the politics of\nus all. We wonder at the enormousness of the archives they must keep and at the difficulty for\neven them to find their way through that mass of papers. As a matter of fact, folio volumes of\ncoarse paper on which clippings from the newspapers can be glued according to some happy\ncombination of the vertical and the horizontal are all that is necessary. Red ink annotations will\nprovide indications of richer dossiers. The secret is to clip all that seems important \nat once\n.\nNewspapers are historical documents prepared by men and women generally ignorant of, and\nindifferent to, history. An occurrence of far-reaching consequence may be mentioned in an\ninconspicuous column and in unemphatic type by so-called specialists \nwho do not realize its\nimportance and will never allude to it again. If the passage is not filed at once its absence may\nmean the loss of a capital link in the chain of events.\nFacts are only the material for thought. Thoughts themselves, that is to say, the illumination\nproduced in our mind by the presence of rich facts, should be preserved even more carefully.\nCertainly it is difficult and sometimes it may be dangerous—for it stops the working of the mind\n—to interrupt an intellectual reaction under pretence of noting it. But while the final result of\nmeditation is before us we can rescue it from the fate of all dreams. The note must be brief\nenough to preclude the danger of what the Veda calls “putting words between the truth and\nourselves,” but it must be full enough to be clear to future, i. e., almost alien, re-reading. If we\nare conscious of an impulse to give a final form to an idea engrossing our mind it is foolish to\nresist or defer it. The best pages of a book are those written at a stretch under such an impulse.\nMany a writer compelled by life to do his work in spite of adverse circumstances has been\ngrateful to himself for not giving in to laziness when the chance of thus fixing a glimpse or even\na glimmer offered itself. He does not know the haunting and torturing phantasm that once his\nview of an object was higher and clearer than it is now.\nBook-writing is the province of specialists, living is the business of us all. Moral life,\nsentimental life, religious life, whatever is above the \nterre à terre\n of mere existing, also consists\nof illuminations which once departed return no more. A diary, a few old letters, a few sheets\ncontaining thoughts or meditations, \nmay keep up the connection between us to-day and our\nbetter selves of the past. I was deeply impressed as a youth by the advice of a spiritual writer to\nread one’s own spiritual notes preferably to even famous works. All saints seem to have done\nso. The moment we realize that any thought, ours or borrowed, is pregnant enough not to be\nwasted, or original enough not to be likely to come back again, we must fix it on paper. Our\nmanuscripts should mirror our reading, our meditations, our ideals, and our approach to it in our\nlives. Anybody who has early taken the habit to record himself in that way knows that the loss\nof his papers would also mean a loss to his thinking possibilities.\ne) \nType of mind produced by this intellectual discipline.\nI have known personally a great many men whose mental development has helped me\nmaterially in writing this book. Two of them have impressed me more than the rest for reasons\nwhich the reader will be told hereafter.\nOne of these men is a contributor to a famous magazine, a writer universally known for his\nknowledge of world politics and his \nexposés\n of them. His rich and luminous articles are eagerly\nexpected by people interested in Eastern questions who have not had the same opportunities\nto go personally into them. They are discussed with respect by all specialists and, on more than\none occasion, I have seen them influence the attitude of statesmen.\nThe other man is a historian of religions. To tackle the history of religions with reverence\nand yet with independence, to secure a hearing on these \nquestions from liberal critics without\nforfeiting the respect of conservatives, is a rare and difficult achievement. This theologian has\naccomplished it: the few scores of specialists who are interested in the same field show by their\ntone in discussing his views that they regard them as the outcome of a sincere wish to prefer\nthe truth to opinion.\nI have known these two distinguished men from the days of our youth, and to tell the\nstartling but instructive truth, both of them used to strike me in those far-away days not as\ndistinguished, but as rather the reverse. To use plain parlance, they were ordinary. To be sure,\nthey exhibited the qualities of the plodder—what obituary notices call indomitable energy—\nand nobody ever dreamed of denying them more than their share of common sense. Also they\nhad that peculiar sort of ambition not easily discernible from a taste for distinction which\nultimately must raise a man above his original triviality. But their innate characteristics were\nordinary. When I meet them, even now, my first impression is still an uncomfortable feeling that\nthey may ruin the fabric of my respect for them by saying something irreconcilable with the\nhigh opinion we all entertain of what they write. They never do, yet I am never quite satisfied\nthat they will never do it. Sometimes, I notice a smile, sometimes a tone of voice, sometimes a\nturn of phrasing which makes me feel on the brink of the abyss. But nothing happens, and I\nnever knew anybody not familiar with these men from boyhood who was the least inclined to\nfeel as I do. Nobody speaks of them as geniuses, but practically everybody regards them as a\ncredit to serious literature. I know that their original angle was narrow, \nyet they show a constant\ninterest in the higher issues, and when they do astonish a little it is by a too explicit aversion\nfor trivialities. Their erudition is boundless. Visibly, they were born with excellent memories and\nstocked them with innumerable data ranging from philosophical views to mere human or\npicturesque details. I admit there never is anything unexpectedly piercing in what they say, but\nthey know their own minds on a vast range of issues. They have come in contact with so many\ntheories and have read so many discussions of them that arguments do not surprise or stagger\nthem. Their arsenal is full of facts which the arguments have to take into consideration, or of\ncounter-theories to qualify them. If all this were not couched in language from which all\nfreshness is absent it would sound like the natural welling of powerful minds. For, there is a\nlight radiating from all the hard facts they handle, and the illumination is enough to silence our\ninward reservations.\nThese men are the living demonstration that helps to thought, as expounded in the\nprevious chapters, produce something so like thought as to be indiscernible from it, at all\nevents enable a man to think his best instead of thinking his easiest. They were ambitious and\nhard-working, they substituted the pleasures of the intellect for what people call pleasure, they\npreferred the nobler issues to the less noble ones, and they chose to study them in the best\nbooks and according to the best methods. They are rewarded not only by the esteem of their\npeers, or by their subtle influence on events, but by the consciousness of possessing rare\nintellectual health and of using their powers with a minimum of waste. \nThis result is well worth\nthe initial effort of preferring something to nothing and of renouncing the universal vacuum.\nMore than once I have had opportunities to contrast these men with others, far their\nsuperiors in talent, whom I used to regard as predestined to brilliant careers. But the careers\nhave been spoiled at the start and the rare faculties have dwindled to supe"

Many promising young professors, physicians\nor lawyers have disappointed expectation and finally created disgust simply because they have\naccumulated obstacles instead of helps on the path of their thought.\nWhat has been lacking? A taste for good books. These men have preferred light\nconversation, cards, or the idleness of the country-club to what they were apparently born to\nlove, and they have deteriorated in consequence. Saint-Simon shows us a gallery of such\nfailures described with ruthless brilliance, but we need only look around us to see the living\nreplicas of them.\nYou will say: knowledge, information are not the same thing as thought, and the art of\neducating one’s self cannot be the Art of Thinking. Certainly not in the case of genius. But\nproviding one’s mind with the best food and with the best hygiene surely is the only way for\naverage faculties not to nullify themselves. Take away data, and darkness will replace brilliant\nspots. Do we not say that God KNOWS everything, instead of saying that He understands\neverything? Imagine the difference in intellects \nlike Malebranche’s or Rousseau’s if they had\nbeen less satisfied with their own phosphorescence and more eager for legitimate working. And\nwho can doubt that the difference between such an age as the seventeenth century, all serenity,\nand our own, all nervousness, arises chiefly from the equipment of the former period? What\ngives cynical Frenchmen that strange political naïveness, at which foreigners marvel, if not a\nlack of information? What made Bossuet, a genius, inferior in controversy to Richard Simon, a\nmere scholar, if not disparity in knowledge of biblical questions? No amount of genius will\nreplace facts where facts, and not genius, are necessary. On the other hand, complete mastery\non the data of a question will give a man beside thoroughness that rapidity of argument which\nwe cannot help calling brilliant thinking though, in reality, it is only information.\nf) \nFurther approximation to original thought.\nI have purposely chosen, to illustrate the value of the methods suggested in this Part III,\ntwo average specimens raised above their apparent possibilities by self-imposed training. But\nthe same training applied to real talents produces results which fill the histories of literature. No\nbetter type can be chosen to represent these than Ernest Renan.\nRenan, we all realize, was not a genius. Neither as a philosopher, a scholar, or a writer can he\nbe compared with truly superior men. Yet, what intelligence! What insight and what outsight!\nWhat an introduction such a book as \nMarc-Aurèle\n is to an intelligent reading of history! The\ntransformation of the meaning of the word “intelligent” and the halo that has simultaneously\nattached to it date \nfrom Renan. When M. Lanson writes of Victor Hugo that it is pitiful to realize\nthat such a genius was not intelligent we know at once where the critic found the nuance he is\nso daringly emphasizing. Renan, more than men of greater power, remains the type of the\ncapacity for comprehending. A host of disciples—among whom Anatole France and Jules\nLemaître are the best known,—have shown how easily the method can be learnt and how\ncertain its results must be.\n1. Whoever has read the best books—not exclusively the classics, but the critics and\nscientists of the past two generations—has acquired not only information but a method of\nthinking. Intelligence is as contagious as gracefulness and wit used to be in the eighteenth\ncentury. This is not all. Taine used to say that thought is a collective, not an individual process.\nWhen we speak of “the mind in the making” we mean the same thing: doctrines are tested and\ndeveloped, methods are improved, views are completed, the work of the whole world becomes\nthe property of each individual seeker who cares to annex its results. In one word the volume of\nthought is growing.\n2. Educated men who thus absorb the results of collective efforts are constantly made to\nsee relations between ideas or between facts, and they take the habit of looking for such\nrelations themselves. A modern man cannot think of Mussolini without thinking also of\nNapoleon; France after 1871 helps him to understand certain aspects of the German mentality\nafter 1919; the colonizing methods of Britain throw light on those of Rome and conversely.\nRenan does this on every page. His nimble \nmind is everlastingly traveling over lists of data\nwhich he juxtaposes or, on the contrary, opposes and this active treatment of them produces\nlight at every step. Signor Ferrero’s habit of visualizing the present in the past and constantly\nsuggesting the process by his choice of words shows the same method. It is indeed the method\nof all modern historians, and it cannot be denied that the results are immeasurably superior to\nthe purely narrative method of former writers.\n3. This habit of never seeing a thing without visualizing another beside it, or behind it, has\nin it something vital which makes it akin to the methods of the dramatist. Receptivity and\nimagination are constantly called into play. Many cultivated men and women spend delightful\nhours resurrecting the past, reconstructing a great historical fact, hearing a great historical\ncharacter talk, testing a philosophy by its probable practical results, or imagining the future. All\nthe time creative imagination is at work.\nWhat is that, if it is not THOUGHT, and yet, it is within the possibility of innumerable\npeople. Let them keep away from trivialities, and, instead, stock their minds with knowledge\nworth while; let them range freely through this mass of data, and thought will be actively\nproduced.\n“\nWhat a shame; There is such a lot in these chapters that I like: solitude, Spinoza, music,\nexhilaration and elevation, methods for not forgetting any more, a sort of easy way of making\nlife, why, yes, of making life useful as well as beautiful.

Yes, it is a shame that thought-lozenges do not exist. I should buy some too.\nWell, can’t you take strong tea, and lie down, as section a of chapter I says and see if your\nproblems will not simplify themselves? Or, can’t you sail for Italy and never open your mouth\ntill you sight Naples? Nothing can be easier and it does the trick, the book says.”\n“\nOh, yes, but it does not. What does it are good books, and reading only masterpieces, and\nnever reading, always studying, in short, a regular mental Battle Creek treatment which I\nknow I can no more submit to than to the real one.

I love the Julius Cæsar little girl, and I abhor\n ’tits détails, \nalways did, I think, for if I were\nreally frivolous I should not be reading this tantalizing stuff. Only, how I wish things could be\nas easy as they sometimes seem!\n”\n“You hate \n’tits détails\n, that is to say, commonness and obviousness, and you love solitude,\nSpinoza. Carthusian monks in white cells, good books which nobody else will read, Roman\nhistory and rare little girls, music and philosophy and sober enthusiasm. All this means that\nyou are a perfect reader for this kind of book, an exceptional candidate for real thinking. What\nyou object to is mental hygiene, adding up intellectual calories, and so forth, is it not?”\n“\nExactly. You describe it all as if you felt as I do.\n \nYes, hygiene is hateful. Give me ten\nsurgeons instead of one dietist. I am ready to strike the bargain, chloroform and all.\n”\n“No, you do not hate hygiene. I see you riding that grey mare every Tuesday. What you are\nafraid of is only the accumulation, the avalanche of restricting advice. In fact, what you seem to\nenjoy in this book is advice. You treasure each counsel as it comes, but when you try to\nremember the hundreds of them, down they come upon you like a landslide.

So give the \nTimes\n a chance, and\nplease, henceforth, only read one chapter of this book at a time. The tabloid idea lies there.”\nPart Four\nCREATIVE THOUGHT\nINTRODUCTORY NOTE\nDoes “creative thought” mean genius? Yes, but remember that any creation, of any\ndescription, by the humblest artisan as well as by a superman, is the product of a state of mind\nwhich ought to be called genius.\nDoes it mean literary creation? Not any more than any other, and the reader ought not to\ninfer from a paragraph or two in section 5 of this Part IV that the following pages are\nintended chiefly for writers. No mistake would lead more fatally to misunderstanding of the\naim of this book. Its real object is to make thought, even in its highest forms, and in any realm,\naccessible to all of us.\n\n1. CREATION\nThis is a fascinating word. The notion of producing something out of nothing, or of\nsubstituting motion for immobility delights even children. There had been many half-draped\nstatues of Venus before the \nVenus de Milo\n, but none producing such a powerful spiritual effect\nwith just stone: we see it, and instantaneously we realize that a superior agency has been at\nwork. Thousands of men have looked up wistfully at a vanishing lark; only Shelley wrote an\nimmortal ode to it. Again, music worth the name means a wonderful creation. Our soul was\nvacant, and here it is filled with images and emotions produced by the most immaterial means.\nWhen we try to think of the Deity we soon discard infinity and eternity, as oppressive for our\nimagination, but creativeness we ponder on without any effort.\nThe reverence, frequently the awe we experience in the presence of genius, arises from the\nsimilarity between its gift and that attribute of the Godhead. We are constantly tempted to\nexaggerate our inferiority. We look at the busts of the great musicians or of the great\nphilosophers; we notice the powerful brows, the searching eyes; we glance at our mirror and\nthe consciousness of belonging to another race weighs us down. We read the lives or the\nletters of these exceptional men; we are not surprised to see them saying about themselves\nthings which we should be ridiculous even to think about ourselves.\nIt is a good thing to read what has been written about genius and geniuses: their lives, full\nof splendid but thwarted efforts, act upon our minds as the lives of the saints act upon our\nspiritual faculties. We feel a sort of pride in them which testifies to our common origin and adds\nfresh vitality to our nobler desires. The presence of superior men is also a unique tonic. But it is\nfutile to hope for an explanation of their gift: they are superior because they are superior, that is\nall. If you ask them how they are that, the answer will only be the laughter of Rabelais, and you\nwill feel smaller than ever.\nIt is also dangerous to place these men on a pedestal and to adore a depressing phantasm\nin their shape. Literary men, poets, dramatists and artists of all sorts have been overestimated\nsince one of them, Diderot, turned the whole capacity of a powerful mind to the exaltation of\ntheir gift. It has not been good for a man like Victor Hugo, or, above all, for a man like Alexandre\nDumas, to be made the prophet of his generation. A phantasm, stronger even than they were,\nwas created which compelled them to fall into attitudes.\nToo often we forget that genius, too, depends upon the data within its reach, that even\nArchimedes could not have devised Edison’s inventions. We also forget that genius is not\ngenius all the time, although it is superior all the time. There were long intervals between\nPasteur’s major illuminations. Poets know inspiration, but they also know periods of aridity\nduring which they live on hope, or faith, and memory. On the other hand, we, humbler people,\nhave our intuitions, our times for feeling on the crest of the wave, for thinking our best and\ndoing \nour best. Let us foolishly imagine, while we are so favored, that our gift, after all, is not of\nthe first quality, and the spell will be broken in an instant.\nThe partiality—to which I have just referred—of the eighteenth century for purely\nintellectual superiority has had baneful effects, especially in France. Voltaire and Diderot had no\nrespect for genius when incarnated in founders of religions and there are still too many people\nwho prefer brilliance to goodness. Political or social reformers, diffusers of knowledge, great\norganizers in any domain; apostles and missionaries, captains of industry, the up-builders of\nmighty fortunes, great generals or great sailors, are treated rather contemptuously by critics\nand pedants, though their mental gift is often as rare, and the intensity of their physiognomy is\nas striking as the gifts and the commanding foreheads of their rivals. Their creations are before\nus, and many of them will be mentioned in history. But is there a single community in the whole\nworld in which there does not exist the tangible proof that a keen wish for securing a noble\nresult, kept up through a lifetime of perseverance, must inevitably attain its goal? Why should\nsuch efforts be regarded as inferior to intellectual efforts, especially when, as is too often the\ncase, egotism is glaringly visible in these? Who would dare to say that Florence Nightingale\nhas not the same right to be regarded as a creator as George Eliot?\nWe may go further. All human lives of any distinction, even if no durable monument\nprolongs them, are creations, sometimes of an artistic, sometimes of a moral nature. There are\nkind, thoughtful men whose names will never be known to the world, \nbut whose lives appear as\nmasterpieces to those who knew them well. Those men were born with the faculties and the\nchances of us all, but they saw what could be made of them and accomplished it. The diary of a\nJoubert or the letters of a Cowper might never have been published, but the people who loved\nJoubert or Cowper for more than there is in their writings would be haunted to their dying day\nby the charm emanating from those retiring existences. Madame Récamier has been dead a\nhundred years, yet, more people stop in a reverie before her picture than before that of Madame\nde Staël. She never wrote for the public, she never orated or prophesied, but the life she led in\nthose three rooms at the Abbaye-aux-Bois is still an ideal for innumerable women who have\nheard of it. Can we say that this fascinating \naura\n is not her own creation? And are not the\nsaints as magnetic as geniuses?\nCompare these people who did things, or \nwere\n the thing, with those other people who never\ndid anything and would have been nothing but for a modest capacity for writing up what\nothers were doing. Which is the real creator, the person who creates inspiration or the one who\nonly receives it?\n\n2. THE ROOT OF CREATION. IDEAS.\nThe root of creation, whether speculative, artistic or practical is, of course, an idea. Gradually\nthis idea grows, annexing or using its neighbors, and becomes a mastering purpose which\ncannot be resisted. Finally it results in some creation. Taine falls in love with a cat, gets\nfascinated by cats, treasures and cherishes innumerable memories of the seductiveness of cats.\nWhen he looks more the dried-up little old scholar than ever he produces the famous sonnets\non cats. Another man has watched a stray cat in the streets: he has seen the poor little creature\nsometimes looking up imploringly at an uncomprehending passenger, sometimes pretending to\nitself that nothing is really happening and trotting along as if surely home must be round the\ncorner. The vision acts through years. Another man might translate it into clumsy language,\nthis one speaks of it in tender words which go to one’s heart. In time a home for stray animals is\nthe result.\nNothing can be simpler. Simplicity is the characteristic of all creative notions. The two\nFrenchmen who had the greatest influence on their countrymen during the latter part of the\nnineteenth century and the early part of the twentieth were undoubtedly Anatole France and\nMaurice Barrès. What acted on their minds before the philosophies they evolved reacted in\ntheir turn on millions of other minds? \nAnatole France looking at the starry sky was struck by\nthe insignificance of man with his ambitions and passions, of the atom-Earth with its\nmicroscopic emp"

Barrès, standing at his father’s grave in Charmes churchyard, while the\nbell was tolling for Vespers and a solemnity was spreading over the village, realized the\ncontinuity between his ancestors and himself, as well as what he called the claims of the soil.\nBoth visions filled the two men’s lives, and are still the souls of forty volumes, and have\ninfluenced the thoughts of millions.\nThe problem obviously is how to have such soul-filling, life-fashioning ideas.\nOur soul is an ocean. Its possibilities, its receptivity and elasticity are mysterious and\nseldom within our ken, but they cannot be doubted. What it stores up during our life is as\nmysterious, but it is as undoubtedly vast. Remember that the Alsatian old woman was eighty\nwhen, during her last illness, she began to talk Hebrew. It was sixty-five years since, as a little\nmaid in the village Rabbi’s home, she had overheard the master reading out \nGenesis\n. She was in\nthe kitchen, she was not a Jewess, she did not care a straw, and yet the whole series of\noutlandish sounds had been preserved on one of the million records in her memory. Who has\nnot been amused or puzzled by the reviviscence of an utterly indifferent sentence, heard years\nbefore, caused by a few syllables bearing a faint resemblance to it? The forgotten words fall on\nour ear, eerie but unmistakable. A strain of music, the odor of mignonette will unexpectedly\nrevive in us states of mind from which, in childhood or adolescence, we shook ourselves free\nbecause their vague pregnancy \nmade them as hard to sustain as their poignancy made them\nexquisite. Inspiration, the high-strung condition in which emotion, eloquence, music, or merely\nstrong coffee can place us, reveals to us whole regions in our souls which have nothing in\ncommon with the sandy barrenness of our daily existence. Often too, in our lives, but more\nfrequently at certain periods than at others, we are conscious that our intellectual vision is\nkeener than people, or even than we ourselves, supposed. We hear a conversation and, as the\nwords cross one another, we register people’s motives as if we were reading them. We go to a\nlecture and we appreciate or criticize it, as it goes on, as we seldom did before. We are\nconscious of all that flashes through our minds. Meanwhile we know that other, less\nperceptible, gleams may gather light if we watch them without pretending to do so, and a rare\nillumination may follow.\nWhat we then see, what we sometimes note on bits of paper which we treasure like misers,\nare the germs from which creation springs, or from which a fuller life is developed. They may be\nshort-lived and elusive, or jostled out of sight by a rush of others, but they do not differ in\nnature from what ultimately becomes, in highly gifted intellects, the work of genius. How they\ncan be multiplied or strengthened, above all, how they can be got at when they have retreated\nto our subconsciousness, is the problem.\n\n3. HOW WE CAN GET AT OUR OWN IDEAS\nPhilosophers worthy of the name all entertain the ambition of giving an explanation of the\nworld. Most of them realize how much that is purely tentative there is in those attempts. On the\ncontrary, most of them are emphatic in their recommendation of some mental process through\nwhich we can attain Truth. This word is getting worn out from over-use, and modern scepticism\nis on its guard against it. But nobody objects if it is understood to denote the illumination\naccompanying the contact of our mind with what we call realities. When we are conscious of\nsuch an illumination, our intellectual search is at an end and repose takes its place.\nIntellectualists like Aristotle, the Schoolmen, Descartes, or most modern scientists look for\nthis illumination in formal logic. They want a full and clear statement of data, and they set\nprecise rules for their elaboration and the verification of the conclusions drawn from them.\nTheir ideal seems to be a scientific collection, well-housed in a roomy hall and arranged in such\nlogical sequence that at no time is the visitor inclined to stop in uncertainty before the\nspecimens displayed for his inspection.\nThere is another, quite contrary, method, which has always charmed people of a religious or\npoetic turn, viz. immediate contact with spiritual realities. A lyrical poet does not refer to\nencyclopædias when he feels the coming of inspiration. We, humdrum \nchurch-goers, are glad of\na good sermon or a serviceable book to help us with our plodding meditation, but great mystics\nhave no need of any such adjuvants: their minds are soon ravished, they do not know where,\nand they stay there, rapt in contemplation. That their minds are not the victims of a fascination,\nno matter how noble, but, on the contrary, follow the rules of some logic is made evident from\nthe fact that, as appears from their writings, contemplation reveals substantially the same\nthings to them all. The virtue of this mental process is also visible in their writings. The\ncharacteristic of mystic literature is sublimity, of course, but it is also a marvellous facility.\nMadame Guyon used to say she could write endlessly about spiritual realities, and she does\nnot differ in this from safer guides than herself. No trace of effort can be detected in Saint\nTeresa’s \nThe Castle of the Soul\n or in the Fourth Book of the \nImitation\n. Many passages in the\nLetters of Saint Paul are more lyrical than anything else. Compare the feverish tension\nperceptible in those of Pascal’s \nPensées\n which are merely the work of his intellect with the state\nof mind easily inferred from the few lines scribbled on his famous amulet, which was the\noutcome of a revelation. From Plotinus to Swedenborg all illuminists have descanted on the\nfloods of light produced by the contemplative process in which they delighted. But is there a\nsingle man or woman who has not experienced something of the kind?\nModern Intuitionists, like Newman or Bergson, are closely related to Mystics. Men of such\nculture and such vast reading cannot but know the value of accurate information, but they\nbelieve in a superior \nlogic making use of it. Pasteur was constantly visited by intuitions which\nhe was afterwards at great pains to check by the ordinary canons of science. Such intuitions\nare not revelations, they are only the result of flashlike comparisons or oppositions of sets of\nimages stored up in the mind and incredibly more elastic than the formulas in our intellect which\nNewman calls the “notional” as opposed to the “real.” Read the \nGrammar of Assent\n, or\nCreative Evolution\n, and you will realize that here are the clear lineaments of an Art of Thinking,\ncertainly depending more on experience and less on mere exposés than the advice given by\nDescartes, Locke, or Herbert Spencer, but aiming at exactly the same goal. A process of lovingly\nbending over one’s consciousness is preferred to an exterior one, but the possession of rich\npregnant notions is the end in view just as well. In the same way, it is difficult to read what\npoets say about their visitations, or what artists say about their art without realizing that these\nmen, constantly bent upon turning their powers to the best account, are in reality laying down\nfor themselves the principles of an Art of Thinking. The writings of two typical modern men,\nNietzsche and Barrès, constantly describe or exemplify a method for the production of thought.\nIs it possible to sum up what all these introspectors say in an immense variety of ways?\nYes. Read them, listen to them, analyze their methods, scan their attitude, you will find that they\nare living and thinking as close as possible to two fundamental precepts:\n1. Be yourself.\n2. Find yourself.\n\n4. “BE YOURSELF”\n“Be yourself if you want to create anything original” is a truism. How can you do anything that\nwill really be yours if you are not conscious of your own personality, if you are somebody else,\nor even everybody else, or if you are not quite the man you know you could be?\nThere are two main obstacles in the way of a man who wishes to be himself: pretence and\ndiffidence. Few people are not hampered, or have not been hampered in some phase of their\nlives, by one or the other.\nPretence or pose is not confidence. Confidence, when it is associated with sterling qualities,\nis not mere confidence any more: we call it brilliance. Balzac poured himself out in conversation\nin a way which gave offence to people of an over-refined taste, but which delighted\npsychologists. The same fault is common in artists whose delight in their conceptions, and\ngradually in themselves, is irrepressible. All people endowed with powerful vitality or\nimagination, most people with a passion for independence which life has not damped too\nseverely, are not afraid of forcing themselves to the forefront. Anglo-Saxon simplicity, added to\nAnglo-Saxon belief in individual rights, produces similar results. People who think Anglo-\nSaxons taciturn or self-contained have seen them under some restraint, or have not lived\nfamiliarly with them.\nCynicism itself is not always a pose either. In its higher specimens it is only an exaggeration\nof sincerity tainted by conceit or by Rousseau’s certainty that nobody is much better than\none’s self. I have always found pleasure in a witty Parisian Jewess’s admission that “she would\nnot be natural if she were not affected.” Most people die without saying anything as terse.\nMarie Bashkirtseff, now that we have some portions of her diary in their entirety and not\ncarefully edited by André Theuriet, may be a Queen of Flirts or a Queen of Snobs; she certainly\nis the author of one of the most sincere human documents we possess. Is there a more irritating\nbook in English literature than \nEvelina\n? Yet, Frances d’Arblay’s self-complacency is so\nmarvellously transparent that after a century and a half the book has not been killed by its\nfaults.\nPose is insincerity in a degree which makes it impossible that the pretender should not be\naware of his own attitudinizing. It means playing at seeming to be what one is not. How could\nthere be any vitality left for personal thought when it is used up in that comedy? How can a\nman hope to be a creator, even on the humblest scale, if he insists on being an actor? People\nwho pretend they follow without difficulty an intricate debate, who pick up formulas thanks to\nwhich they can judge airily of literature and art, who affect to be experts in foreign politics\nbecause they have travelled and were in Geneva during the League’s last session, who give\nthemselves the airs of knowing people they have never met and say “my friend So and So” of a\ndistinguished man they have met just once; the innumerable people who would think\nthemselves disgraced \nif they were to say: “No, I have never read Walter Page’s letters, but I\nread trash in bed every night”; people who applaud a foreign orator whose language they have\nnever learnt—those people are actors, some of them as clever as any on the stage, but they will\nnever say a word which somebody else will deem worth remembering, and they will never have\na thought which will give them the hope of being better than mere gramophones.\nProfessional writers, by the score and the hundred, are apt to be insincere and to lose\nthereby all their chances of honest improvement. Many of them are almost compelled to be so.\nThey were sincere at first in their liking for literature but they had little to say, and when that\nlittle was said, they were not in a position to stop; writers they were, and to write they had. So,\nthey do write, without any real impulse, on a multitude of subjects. They fill the newspapers,\nalas! Their jejune glibness, their dodging all that might commit them, their artificial humor do\nnot take in, for one instant, even an unprofessional reader who wants information and is\nconscious he is not getting it, but, all the same, that way of writing is the great lullaby that puts\nthe modern mind to sleep. Observe that even so-called specialists or savants can debase\nthemselves by such tricks. I have read the works of medical or archæological experts who were\nexpert above all at saying Yea and Nay in the same sentence.\nLiterary fashions are destructive of the writer’s personality. How hot the French\nRomanticists used to make themselves by trying to climb up to Victor Hugo’s heights! How\nmuch French wit must have perished in the darkness of Realism! How many \nwriters between\n1890 and 1920 copied the complacent rhythm of Anatole France without being able to rival his\nrange of illustration, his sensibility, or even the quality of his naughtiness! Who can tell how\nmuch that is sterling observation of life or of the human heart can be destroyed by the mere\naffectation of a rhythm? Anybody who has tried his hand at a pastiche must know how\nstrangely this amusement helps the special inspiration needed and what unexpected facility it\ndevelops in one, but is not this what happens with a farcical drawing-room imitation? The\nimitation of exterior qualities is detrimental to real creativeness, and, as Herbart says, ultimately\nbecomes injurious to character. Acted, spoken, or written insincerity is \nper se\n destructive of\npersonality and comes to negative results. The more we try to seem what we are not, the smaller\nour chance becomes of fully being what we really can grow to be.\nD\nIFFIDENCE\n is the other fault that prevents us from being ourselves. It has a right to a great deal\nmore attention and more sympathy than its counterpart.\nDiffidence must be carefully distinguished from indolence which also frequently\nmasquerades as modesty. Many people can never be themselves because they cannot stiffen\nlong enough to be conscious of their own personality. They are the man they listen to, or the\nbook they are reading: they are not themselves. In childhood, medicine or athletics can remedy\nthis feebleness, for effort of any kind is enough to create a beginning of personality. Properly\ncultivated emulation or self-interest can also help education in its work of developing individual\npossibilities. Later in life, there would still be hope if the wish for individuality, or a vision of the\nbliss there is in the feasts of the intellect, could be conjured up. But they seldom can. Even\ncatastrophes leave supineness unmoved.\nDiffidence proper may be a form of conceit: better shrink into one’s self than appear as one\nis, that is to say, inferior to what one would like to be. Often too, it is the consciousness that\none is ill-prepared by natural inclination or gifts, by education, or by present circumstances to\ndo what one is doing. Or it is the vague reproach of our conscience when our immediate\npreparation has not been what it might have been. A charlatan does not mind, but an honorable\nman, especially a man who lives more or less in the hope of some day producing beauty, is\nafraid of spoiling one more chance after many others.\nPhantasms of all kinds naturally find an easy prey in sensitive natures. Artists are well-\nknown to be what people who are not artists call ill-balanced. They may be pretty well satisfied\nwith what they have achieved in the past: a poem, a chapter of a novel written by them several\nyears before and beginning to be forgotten enough to seem like the work of somebody else, will\noften give them keen pleasure. But while this poem or chapter was being written it procured\nmore annoyance than satisfaction. The artist constantly bears in his mind the idea of an\nimpossible perfection. As he works, or just before he begins to work, his mind is full of elusive\nbut the more fascinating images which he hopes to fix by words. The moment he endeavors to\ndo so, or even tries to see these images more \nclosely, they vanish, leaving only the fragments\nof expression with which he has begun to clothe them. Those remnants are enough to enrich\nmasterpieces, but compared to the mysterious appearances which came before them they are\nlike mere dross. Read Katherine Mansfield’s \nDiary\n; you will realize what a writer whose every\ntouch seems to be final went through, feeling that all she was doing, far from being final, was\ntentative and inadequate. The notions: “This could be expressed better” or “Somebody is sure\nto express this better” are paralyzing phantasms, and diffidence is a mild word to describe their\neffect.\nMany times too, the artist will think of some rival he may or may not love, but admires, and\nimagine that this person would do the same work with wonderful ease and in far better style.\nFrequently he will be doubtful of his subject and regard it as inferior to several others which a\nlittle thought might soon reveal to him. He may have moral qualms too, imagining the practical\neffects of what he is producing on minds whose weakness or sensitiveness he exaggerates.\nCharlotte Brontë almost says that her conscience would not have allowed her to write\nWuthering Heights\n, even if she had had her sister’s inspiration for it. All these ideas,\nextraneous to the one w"

      "chapter_text": "hich ought to monopolize attention, are phantasms obscuring the\nintellect and weakening the willpower necessary for artistic achievement. Suppose enough of\nthem, or a siege of one long enough to create a habit, and the man will not be himself any more,\nor will be himself in a diminished way.\nWhat can be done? Dominique, in Fromentin’s classical novel, just gives up, thinking it\nbetter to \nbe himself as a gentleman-farmer than feel dwarfed as a poet. A desperate solution.\nBalzac, after his seventh or eighth failure, might have adopted it too and been satisfied with just\nbeing a printer, as indeed he was at the time. Yet, he was within a year or two of the inspiration\nwhich never left him afterwards. Perhaps the effort he made as a business man kept his will-\npower up to the mark as an artist. Everybody will be benefited by going into some enterprise,\ncharitable or other, in which responsibility of a definite character will be involved; by being in\nsome fight for a real ideal, and by speaking in public about it. The artist who is nothing else and\nfeels phantasms sitting on his chest is a martyr, and ought to do anything to escape from the\ntorture and humiliation.\nWhatever method we resort to we shall find that any powerful ideal or idea in us cures\ndiffidence and creates not only forcefulness but a magnetism. The moment we are conscious of\nany such forces filling our minds and our lives, we shall also be conscious of their irresistibility.\nSo, the problem of how to be one’s self is ultimately a moral problem: viz, how to make the best\nuse of one’s faculties.\n\n5. “FIND YOURSELF”\nTo be one’s self, in the last resort means, as we said, a stiffening of the attention or of the will.\nTo find one’s self means the reverse. We are not living with ourselves when we are too\nattentive to exterior things. We may feel the most conscious of our own personality when we\nare the most active, when we are straining every nerve in the pursuit of some object; but we\nnever dream of saying that we are finding ourselves when we are in that busy condition. On the\ncontrary, we are apt to wish for the end of it, and we long for a time of quiet meditation to\npossess our soul in peace. Languages are full of metaphors describing those opposite states of\nconsciousness, a sure proof that they are well-known to us all.\nWe “find ourselves” in any mental atmosphere recalling that of a course of reflections in\nsolitude, of a reverie in the gloaming or in a quiet autumnal scene, or of a moral crisis which\nrevitalizes, without crushing, us. We know times of intellectual intensity produced we seldom\nknow how, but during which we feel segregated from the rest of the world, and yet in sympathy\nand understanding with everything. Some great book, the vicinity of genius or saintliness,\nmusic, are some of the causes, but there are many others, sometimes as unlikely as those\nproducing hypnotic phenomena, which take us where our innermost is to be really found. The\nviolinist, \nbending with touching fondness over his instrument, loves it, no doubt, for what it is\ngiving him, but the soft radiance over his face means that beginning of ecstasy which is the\nravishment of a soul into itself. All reflective, all productive natures tend towards such states.\nWhen I was a very little boy my people used to picnic sometimes in a pretty Ardennes\nvalley under a clump of oak trees shading the grey walls and discolored slate-roof of an ancient\nmill. Before leaving, the party would visit the miller for a quarter of an hour, and the \nsalle\nbecame a scene of unusual animation. I generally managed to slink out of it, unobserved,\nthrough an arch opening on to a stone staircase. There was next to no light on those steps at\nfirst, and what little there was made it look dismal and vaultlike. You went down and down the\nwinding staircase at least thirty steps, the light growing stronger but of a strange green tint as\nyou approached the bottom. Dripping sounds and the rush of swift water over pebbles were\nheard. Finally appeared the scene I had been longing for. A deep cut through the polished slaty\nstrata, mosses and dainty ferns of all kinds hanging from every moist cranny; strass pendants\nover it all. On my right the broad wooden wheel seemed enormous and ferocious, and I would\nlook away from it, knowing that I should be terrified if it should suddenly begin to turn and\nmake its thumping noises while starting the stone and iron machinery upstairs. But, running\nswiftly past, there was the brook, broad and shallow, marvellously clear and cool, catching\nevery green reflection from the walls and a little of the blue up above. I would stay there for\nwhat \nseemed a long time, sometimes quite nervous, yet unable to leave. What I saw, what I\nheard, what I felt and thought in that magical place seemed to be more my own by right of\ndiscovery than anything else.\nI have never been able to read about the stream of consciousness without remembering the\nmiller’s brook. We can only get at what is nearest to our most personal, viz., our\nsubconsciousness, by leaving the hubbub of the world where it is and seeking in deep repose\nfor what differentiates us from other men and women.\nThe following seem to be the most practical rules for succeeding in that search.\n1. \nFind your own vein.\n Our vein means the stratum of our consciousness that is the richest,\nand which will yield the most. In other words, it means the objects, whatever they may be,\nabout which we think our best. What are those? It is unfortunate to have to say that bad\npsychology, only too often influencing education, answers: they are the objects on which you\nexpend the greatest amount of study. The answer, on the contrary, should be: they are the\nmaterial for thought which you handle with the greatest ease and with the greatest enjoyment.\nIt is impossible to reflect about the principles of an Art of Thinking without admitting to one’s\nself that what one is endeavouring to do is to devise a method bringing us all nearer to genius.\nNow genius is primarily power resulting in ease. Genius never plods. When Buffon defines it as\n“a long patience” he means not the patience of doggedness, but the perseverance of\nenjoyment. Who will believe that, during \nthe seventeen years of his quest after his law, Newton\ndid not derive immense pleasure from what we wrongly call his work, but which ought to be\ncalled the fascinating occupation of his mind? Genius is well known to be able to devote longer\nstretches to its work than ordinary talent which needs intervals of relaxation. The reason is that\nthe relaxation of genius lies in the consciousness of doing what it loves to do and would hate\nto forego. Pope, who once wrote:\nof happy convents bosomed deep in vines,\nmight have parodied Shelley, but he never could have written the poem on the Euganean\nhills. Imagine Dickens writing society novels. Genius may be associated with other talents and\nits brilliance may deceive us by its multiform achievements, but we never mix it up with\nversatility: it is something higher.\nWhat books do you read with most pleasure? On our shelves are some volumes which are\nour family, and others which are only visitors. Which are the first? What are those from which\nwe catch ourselves mentally quoting to ourselves? What subjects keep us really interested?\nWhat are those on which we talk the most easily, and with the greatest pleasure, to ourselves\nand to others? Education, the unfortunate notion that an effort must be associated with\neverything great—a curious perverseness in many high intellects—are responsible for\nridiculous delusions. Ingres preferred being complimented about his talent as a violinist to\nhearing about his genius as a painter. Falguière, the sculptor, would \nshow visitors his paintings,\nbut not his statues. One day Henner was being taken round the studio, and before every\ncanvas would, to Falguière’s delight, exclaim: stunning! marvellous! Coming to a small marble\nwhich Falguière was passing by without a glance, the other artist stopped short and said with\nhis Alsatian accent: “Ah! but this is good!”\nWhat is nearest at hand is our vein, but it takes luck or experience to convince us of it. The\nSpanish crew who were becalmed in the ocean, off the mouth of the Amazon River, could not\nbelieve the natives signalling that the water all round their ship was good to drink and they had\nonly to throw down the buckets. Far-fetched is a phrase which, in its broader sense, applies to\nmost of what we do. "

      "chapter_text": "Yet, we are all conscious that what we like best in a writer are the works\nreflecting the most naturally his own peculiar gift and temperament. Who reads Bossuet’s\nuncouth poetry? We like things to give us the impression that they flow. Again, what writer\ndoes not realise that his most successful pages are the ones which gave him the least trouble?\n2. \nSpeak or write in your vein.\n As you sing on the breath. People in love or in anger, or\npossessed of some strong conviction or desire, are always eloquent. Few of us have not had\nsome occasion to hear speeches, more stirring than those even of great orators, poured out by\nhighly-wrought people who did not care a straw for eloquence.\nWriters with a deep moral background of any description are well known to possess a richer\nvein than mere artists. Why do people nowadays prefer the violent ill-mannered Léon Bloy to\nAnatole \nFrance? What makes Léon Daudet, in spite of his prejudices, injustice and conceit, the\nJuvenal of this generation? Anybody drawing on a similar reserve will produce similar effects.\nPeople are right to make game of the exaggerations of Super-Realists. Mr. James P. O’Reilly,\nwriting in \nThe Irish Statesman\n about Mr. James Joyce, describes their method without any\ncharity:\n“Sit in a favorable spot where the mind can concentrate on itself—or on nothing at all. Get into as passive or\nas receptive a condition as possible. While thinking of nothing definite, write quickly whatever comes to mind—\nquickly, so as not to retain and so as not to rewrite. When you are conscious of influencing by reason what your\nhand is writing, begin again. Write, for example, a series of l’s until the letter l unconsciously begins a word,\nand your thought series continues. There’s the method.”\nSurely, this is the method of many practical jokers who call themselves Super-Realists, but it\nis not the method of some extremely talented young men among them, nor that of two of their\nmost famous predecessors. Read Péguy’s \nJeanne d’Arc\n, an undoubted masterpiece which the\nauthor produced at twenty-two. Read most of Claudel’s works, and you will know what is meant\nby writing in one’s vein. All rising literary schools are the outcome of a mental experience\nshowing a few born writers that freedom and naturalness are essential to inspiration. They all\nrediscover the same principles. I have said before that the Middle Ages owed their unique\ncreativeness, in all the realms of art, to their freedom from phantasms. So did the French\nRomanticists till they became hampered by the phantasm \nof admiration. Super-Realists want to\nwrite from their subconsciousness, that is to say, as humanly, richly and freely as possible.\nEverybody wants to draw on that vein. When I hear that Racine, the perfection of his perfect\nage, used to write his plays in prose before transmuting them into the exquisite dramatic poems\nwhich foreigners find it so hard to call poetry, I always feel inclined to think that those first\ndrafts were Super-Realist effusions, as different from \nPhèdre\n or \nAthalie\n as Flaubert’s first\nversion of \nLa Tentation de Saint Antoine\n was different from the one he finally evolved and\ndefinitely spoiled. Have you never noticed the tendency of most artists to describe their first\nhaunting view of their work in familiar, or worse than familiar language? A super-realist effort to\nkeep away literary composition with its trammels and phantasms as long as possible.\nSome rhythms—taking the word in its fullest meaning—keep the writer nearer his\nsubconsciousness than others. The Homeric rhythm does it more infallibly than any other. You\nwill feel it in Mr. Belloc’s books, even if the author does not tell you, as he once admitted to me,\nthat Homer is the only novelist he reads. You will feel it in Barrès’ best book, \nLa Colline\nInspirée\n, about which I also had the author’s own testimony. The habit of working on such a\nrhythm results in an almost physical sensation informing us that we are drawing on our\ninnermost.\n3. \nKnow the value of intuition.\n An intuition is the mental act we produce the most naturally\nand with the least tangible alloy of extraneous elements. Suddenly \nan illumination flashes upon\nus which we had perhaps longed for, perhaps not. In one instant we see, as the word implies,\nwhat we had not seen before, and we become conscious of the repose accompanying certitude.\nA solution of some difficulty which we have been fighting with, perhaps for a long time; the\ntransformation, as by magic, of a whole situation which we had viewed in a pessimistic mood,\nnow quite differently; a clue unexpectedly found to a person’s disposition which used to puzzle\nus; the revelation of the something indefinable we call the physiognomy of a city; an idea for\nour work; a whole dramatic scene visualized as if it were acted before us; a strong conviction,\nlike that which filled Pasteur and had filled three or four men before him, that a method which\nseems preposterous to others is however as sensible as it seems to us, are examples of\nintuitions. Hundreds could be found.\nNo strain, and on the contrary, a sensation of fulness and freedom are felt during those brief\nbut dazzling revelations. If you have a gift for mimicry, you know that the moment you imagine\nyourself to be the other person, you require no effort to think, speak and gesticulate as he\ndoes. To an inferior actor this would mean prolonged study of each individual imitation, to one\npossessing this talent the whole thing is implied in the initial vision.\nIntuitions are not always as rich as the ones just enumerated, they may only be rapid\nglimpses vanishing before we have had time to seize them and as tantalizing as they are\nfascinating. But fascinating they always are. They have nothing in common with the teasing\napprehensions or the depressing doubts \nwhich often shoot across our consciousness in much\nthe same manner. Some books, at times any book, will produce them. We then experience a\ncurious duplication: we go on with the book because we love the illuminations accompanying\nour reading, yet we are on our guard against it, because we realize that if we should give it our\nfull attention we should also interrupt the magic display it has caused but not produced. Hard\npebbles would be substituted for the gems we have been touching ever so caressingly.\nThese minor intuitions often come in clusters, or in a quick succession, but most often\nwithout any apparent connection. When we are dreaming awake, or under the influence of\nmusic, their number is so great that no calculation can approximate it. We then squander them\nfreely. Yet, we know their value, for, sometimes, they develop into protracted trains of thought,\nduring which we realize that our brain is doing its best work, yet doing it without taxing our\ncoöperation. This is what we want to reproduce after the spell has been interrupted, this is what\nwe call thinking, and the mention of an Art of Thinking means to us chiefly the possibility of\nrecreating at will a similar state of mind. What we call understanding or comprehending is this\nsuperior annexation of some intellectual growth. Learning or deducing, as algebra or logic teach\nus to do, we regard as inferior processes resulting in joyless acquisitions.\n4. \nTreat intuitions tenderly.\n Spiritual books occasionally quote a Latin saying which has\nterrified more than one soul: \ntime Jesum transeuntem et non\n \nrevertentem\n: “Dread the passage\nof Jesus, for He does not return.” This amounts to saying: do not let religious intuitions escape\nyou, for they do not come twice.\nIt is an exaggeration to say that intuitions of any kind never come twice, but they do not\ncome twice with the same appeal. The moment we feel their presence, it is as if we saw the ripple\nover Bethesda and we ought to know that our chance is near. Silence, both exterior and interior,\nshould prevail; we ought to be attentive but not eager or, above all, curious. The beautiful\nvisitor is like a butterfly, no longer the same when caught. So it must not be caught. If your\nhand feels for a card and scribbles a few words for fear another thought might displace the first,\nyou will be grateful to yourself, even if you have, many times, to regret the concision forced\nupon you. But if you are over-wise, and if, in your delight at the visitation, you strive to lose no\naspect of it, inserting it forcibly into your intellectual system and greedily noting what it says to\nyou in its rich pregnancy, you will kill it.

      "chapter_text": "at is best in Pascal’s \nPensées\n? Certainly the\nunfinished parts; the briefer these memos the deeper the vista. La Bruyère would finish his\nportraits and most of the short essays he has interspersed between them. However, he certainly\ncared less for those cameos than for the short maxims which he never dared to expand. Writing\nis one of the methods of relieving the mind, but a desire satisfied is not a desire any more, and it\nis a pity.\nMost French writers cannot put pen to paper without having done what they call—too\ntruly and almost cruelly—thinking \nout\n their idea. There lies \nthe once living thing, dissected into\nparagraphs. It cannot be \nthought\n any more, it can only be written. The vaunted French lucidity\nis due to that, but what people sometimes call French unpoeticalness is also due to it. English\nwriters, and even more Russian writers, either feel the presence of their inspiration more deeply,\nor they are in no such hurry to fix their thoughts, or when they do so their thinking is not over.\nThey do not write because they have thought, they think while writing. Obscurity, congestion,\nlack of balance are often the consequences. Newman admitted there were passages in his own\nGrammar of Assent\n which he did not understand. But, what of that, if the writer makes you\nthink, instead of merely teaching you? I believe that French writers are more apt than others to\nfeel the disparity between what they had first conceived and what they actually see between\ntwo book covers because of their over-conscious method.\nTo work on an idea does not mean intellectual concentration of the usual kind. No sweating\nhere will do. A prayerful solitude with a dash of austerity in the daily routine is necessary; then,\nwhat Tyndall, describing the production of inventions, called “brooding,” and what Newton\ncalled “thinking of it all the time.” It seems as if the earnest wish to get at the whole thing\nshould be the chief thing, acting, of course, on our subconsciousness. The experience of most\nartists is that the quality of their production is in keeping with the intensity of their wish. As I\nsaid before, Sir Walter Scott reading books with no relevance whatever to his subjects, or\nCharles Dickens rambling through the deserted streets at night, was trying to retard rather than\nhasten what we call clear thought, but which ought to be called final thought.\nReal work, real brooding consist in peopling the mind with congenial images, sometimes\ncalled in by our desire, sometimes conjured up from our memories gone over at random rather\nthan methodically. When the light comes at last, as full as we can expect it ever to be, whatever\nwe do, do not let us map out what we have discovered in the shape of a synopsis. Numbering\nand brackets are too unlike thought ever to revive its first appearance.\n5. \nCultivate evocative moods.\n There is in us a stratum more sensitive than the rest, which\nwe know and where we can go at will. A behaviorist would say that the inevitability of the\nresponse from that stratum in our consciousness proves that it is biological, but all I want to\nsay is that we know from experience that the response is sure. If we live a great deal with\nourselves we increase our personality, and if we revive certain facts or periods, or phases of\nfeeling in our lives, we heighten our receptivity.\nOur life with its peaks—which we know—of sentiment, effort, nobility, or increased\nintelligence, is a veritable mine of evocative moods. A few minutes’ leisure is enough to replace\nourselves in such moods, and no sooner are we conscious of them than the phosphorescence\nof intuitiveness begins. Poets know it well. Their own experience, sometimes woefully restricted\nin appearance, is the constant support of their inspiration. They, as well as artists, are\nremarkably like children, and have never broken the thread binding the various periods of their\nlives together, as men living in the world, and for the \nworld, will do. Their childhood especially,\nwith its wealth and depth of impressions, is frequently present to them. Nothing is more\nevocative than the memory of early years. What narrative of a childhood, from \nDavid\nCopperfield\n to \nDu Côté de chez Swann\n, does not delight us, even when the novelist or\nmemorialist has not the power of a Dickens or a Proust? The reason is that all the impressions\nrecorded are fresh, and connect at once with the freshest ones we possess. Life, in time,\nwrenches us from those memories to mind what we call our fights, which are, in most cases,\nanything but noble, but even very young people realize their value to themselves. I used to\nknow a school-boy who, before tackling an essay, would go back to his childish emotions or\ngriefs, and imagined he found himself at once in the productive part of his soul.\nSome far-away states of consciousness, difficult to define at the time, because they were so\nrich, and never quite exhausted in spite of frequent drawing upon them, still preserve their\nhaunting quality and evocative power. I shall never quite account for the fact, that long before\nvisiting Spain I felt something Spanish in the atmosphere of the Good Friday of a year when I\nwas nine or ten. The same \néclat\n, the same impassioned violence. Later on, an afternoon of All\nSouls’ Day filled me with the same wondering excitement which, even now, I can renew at a few\nminutes’ notice. It was a brilliant November afternoon, apparently ill-suited to the melancholy of\nthe day; the heavens were high and deep. An east wind was blowing its mad exhilaration\nthrough the park avenues, themselves all sunny and lyrical. From one kingly aspen thousands\nof golden leaves \nseemed to leap into the blue, little souls released, at last, and plunging into\ninfinity. The château had not been deserted for Paris, yet, but its inmates were not abroad, and I\nwas the only living person looking at the gorgeous sight. I felt as if I possessed it all with all its\nmagic, as if the mystery of Autumn’s beauty were solved at last; yet, I should have been unable\nto analyze the scene and its effect upon me.\nWho cannot remember such moments, and who, remembering them, does not realize that he\nis where his soul is the most active, although it does nothing to break its passivity? Such\nexperiences, renewed when we wish, do more than years of conscious effort or laborious study\nto teach us what thought is and where it is.\n\n6. LITERARY PRODUCTION POSSIBLE TO ALL\n“\nLiterary production possible to all . . . You want us to be writers like yourself, don’t you?\n—Or, do you feel that writing is the only way to reach perfection in thinking?\n”\n“Far be it from me to wish for such a thing! If I could reduce printed matter to one-\nthousandth of what it is, I should do it in a second. And if there is a melancholy object it is the\nman or woman trying to write, as others try to sing, or paint, or act, or do anything, without\ntalent.”\n“\nWell then, what is that marvellous literary production which, being possible to all, is\ntherefore possible to me? How can I wriggle myself into the history of literature without\nadding to that mountain of printed matter which you say you dislike?\n”\n“Do you regard all that is in print as literature?”\n“\nWhat a question! Ask me another.\n”\n“Then do you think that all that has a right to be called literature is in print?”\n“\nNo, O Socrates, I do not. Every day we hear of famous writers’ unpublished manuscripts\nbeing discovered. They were literature from the moment they were written, I should think. Year\nafter year we hear that somebody’s correspondence or somebody’s memoirs have just been\ndiscovered and are going to be printed. I suppose those memoirs and letters are literature,\nand were so even in manuscript.\n”\n“Yes, Madame de Sévigné’s or Chesterfield’s letters are in every text-book, and so are Saint-\nSimon’s memoirs, and so is Pepys’ diary, and so are hundreds and hundreds of collections of\nletters or memoirs by less known authors who, however, cannot be left out of what we call\nliterature. Why?”\n“\nWell written, I suppose.\n”\n“But what is good writing?”\n“\nWhy, distinguished language, or witty language, or noble, or touching, or in any way\nfascinating language. Whatever is high above the common run of what we all write is well\nwritten, I should think.\n”\n“Excellent! You realize there is a distinction to be made between mere words and the\nsentiments they express. If Jeanne d’Arc, who certainly was no scholar, had left a\ncorrespondence, it would be literature no doubt.”\n“\nWh"

      "chapter_text": "y! If Tommy Jones’ love-letters to Miss Brown were revealed they would be literature.\nHe once showed one to me and I turned green with envy. Yet, Jones is no writer, bless him.\n”\n“You mean that every deep or strong sentiment, faithfully expressed, is literature. And so it\nis. That is why we all love letters so, and read them as greedily fifty years after they were\nwritten as the maid of fifty years ago did when she found them on madame’s desk. We hate\negotism, but somehow we love to hear people talk about themselves.”\n“\nDo you . . . do you think my letters are literature?\n”\n“Some of your letters must have been. But those which you write to me nowadays are\ncertainly not. You never say a word about what you think or feel, you tell me what you do or\nwhat other people \ndo, but you never analyze either your own, or their motives as you would, as\nin fact you constantly do, while discussing people in the smoking-room. Your letters are full of\ntrivialities and full of clichés. Surely Jones’ letter to Miss Brown did not look like that.”\n“\nI am afraid you are right, even if you are discouraging. But shall I tell you why I write\nthat kind of letter, why we all write the same letter, all the time? Well, business does that. You\nget used to dictating twenty times over the same letter to different people, and in time your\nmind cannot get away from the business rhythm. I write to my wife as I do to you, and she used\nto complain about it. Now she does not. She is used to it, I suppose.\n”\n“You’ve hit the nail on the head this time. When I say that we all can produce literature in\nour letters I mean that a letter gives us a unique chance of expressing our self. Nobody is\nreading it over our shoulder, nobody is expected to criticize it after it is written. In the terms\nused in this book, no phantasm is to be feared, no inferiority complex is likely to weaken us. We\nare at our best to express what we know best, namely, the feelings immediately perceptible to\nour consciousness. This ought to result in absolute naturalness, which is literature. I know a\nnovelist, a woman, whose books are painful reading. The poor dear is never herself. She is\nSinclair Lewis one year, Willa Cather the next, that is to say she tries to be, but only produces\ncheap imitations like an Oklahoma seamstress trying to copy Paris styles. But the same woman\nwrites letters in which you see her life and her soul in a transparent light, every word acting like\na bright little bulb instead of a dull little patch.”\n“\nOh, I know what you mean, of course, but why should I write literature?\n”\n“Nobody wants you to write literature. What I object to is waste. Every day you waste a\nchance, many chances in fact, of getting at your innermost consciousness by expressing\nyourself as you see yourself, and I say it is a pity because it makes you, year after year and day\nafter day, more like anybody else and more anonymous. Mind you, you may have more\nstrength, or what you call strength, to-day than when you left college, but you had more\nindividuality at twenty-one than now. You were nearer to yourself and nearer to good books,\nthat is to say, to a standard of satisfactory expression. Indeed, like most people, you wrote a\nmuch better letter in those days. You have hardened and ossified from mere laziness resulting in\nrather shameful imitation. You have to bear your share of the blame for hearing the same\nconversation ten times over if you go to ten different places. Literature is self-expression, I tell\nyou, and self-expression is individuality, and our individuality is our self, which ought to be our\nchief concern. But we enrich that poor self of ours all our lives with money, and all our lives we\nimpoverish it by stealing from it what makes it our self till there is nothing left. The language is\nonly too accurate when it speaks of nobodies or ciphers. The world is a huge number\nconsisting of a few figures and of an astronomical row of noughts. Therefore, stiffen, resist, say\nno, for heaven’s sake, and if you do, you will be a real man and your letters will be real letters\nwhich might be printed as so many have been.”\n“\nI will make a note of all this. It is worth it, and I dare say it is what you call literature.\n”\n“Let literature alone, but by all means make notes. If you would note all that you hear or\nthink that you feel is worth remembering, the collection would be a valuable diary. Read Amiel’s\nDiary, it will not bore you, and you will see what can happen in a life spent in a little Swiss town\nin which apparently nothing ever happened. Packed full with the only things that count:\nthoughts and sentiments.”\n“\nWell, I am willing to produce literature of the kind you describe, but how I should hate to\nappear, in print!\n”\n“I know. You only print the balance-sheet of your bank. That is enough, and lots of people\nthink it capital reading. But let me assure you that innumerable writers whose books you hear\nmentioned possessed less capacity for reading their own consciousness or expressing it than\nmany men of whom destiny made bankers.”\nTo sum up, everyone of us can be personal, that is to say, creative, if he is not in danger of\nlosing his personality in self-consciousness, or through the phantasms besetting whoever tries\nto express himself. This means that he, at once, becomes interesting to his fellow-beings and\nindifferent only to an individual who will drown himself in the multitude. This interest is the\nbasis of literature, and so, it is obvious that we all can produce what has a right to be called\nliterature, but we must not be\n \nthinking of literature while doing so. The doctrine underlying\nthis volume is that thought alone counts, and thought cannot coexist with anything that is\nnot our self in its highest and noblest possibility.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThis book has not been written for literary people although it had to be based on a writer’s\nexperience. Nothing could be farther removed from its purpose than a tendency to regard the\nthinker as a specialist instead of as merely a man worthy of the name. The author feels deep\nrespect for any man in possession of high principles which speak through his conduct as well\nas through his words. Whatever may be his deficiencies this man is a thought incarnate.\nGive such a person the means of strengthening his thinking capacity by broadening the\nfield and raising the level of his thought, and you will make him and his influence\nproportionately greater. Show him the possibility of attaining to Vision or Creativeness, and\nyou lift him up to the supreme height.\nThis is what this book is trying to do. It cannot produce the wish to think where it does not\nexist, but, given this indispensable germ, it ought to provide the necessary conditions to bring\nit to maturity. Ask men who have developed what started them on their progress. You will often\nbe surprised by the simplicity as well as by the variety of their answers. A few words in a book,\nthe catalog of a school, the mere outline of a method, the impression left by an exceptional man,\nhis reaction to intelligence or to fatuity, the expression of his face, his very silences, may have\nbeen enough.\nA similar effect can be produced or, at all events, prepared, by some random sentence in\npages full as these are of a desire to help thought. To some people the advice: “Read the\nnewspaper as a page of history,” will sound like an epigram. But to others it may be the\nstarting-point of a new mental life. Others again may be helped by the mere rhythm of this work,\nby its Contents, or by its title alone.\nHere, as in other things, what is wanted is a beginning and a method. The beginning\nbelongs to God, but the method belongs to us, and it can be learned, in a few hours, even from\nsuch a book as this. The writer has had no other ambition and he cherishes no greater hope\nthan that of being useful.\n⁂\n\nINDEX\nAbulia \n112\nAddison \n67\n, \n133\nAdler \n51\nÆneid\n \n128\nAlbert (prince)
