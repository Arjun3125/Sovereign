Without her, \nnone of this would have been possible. \nI must also thank my dear friend Michiel Schwarz who was responsible for involving me in \nthe art school Fabrika in Italy and introducing me there to Joost Elffers, my partner and producer \nof The 48 Laws ofPower.1t was in the scheming world ofFabrika thatJoost and I saw the timeless­\nness of Machiavelli and from our discussions in Venice, Italy, this book was born. \nI would like to thank Renri Le Goubin, who supplied me with many Machiavellian anec­\ndotes over the years, particularly conceming the numerous French characters who play such a \nlarge role in this book. \nI would also like to thank Les and Sumiko Biller, who lent me their library on Japanese his­\ntory and helped me with the Japanese Tea Ceremony part of the book. Similarly, I must thank \nmy good friend Elizabeth Yang who advised me on Chinese history. \nA book like this depended greatly on the research material available and I am particularly \ngratenIl to the UCLA Research Library; I spent many pleasant days wandering through its in­\ncomparable collections. \nMy parents, Laurette and Stanley Green, des erve endless thanks for their patience and \nsupport. \nAnd I must not forget to pay tribute to my cat, Boris, who kept me company throughout the \nnever-ending days of writing. \nFinally, to those people in my life who have so skillfully used the game of power to manipu­\nlate, torture, and cause me pain over the years, I bear you no grudges and I thank you for sup­\nplying me with inspiration for The 48 Laws ofPower. \nviii ACKNOWLEDGME NTS Rohert Greene \nCONTENTS \nPRE FACE page xvii \nLAW 1 page 1 \nNEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER \nAlways make those above you feel comfortably superior.

If you have no enemies, find a way to \nmake them. \nLAW 3 page 16 \nCONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS \nKeep people off-balance and in the dark lly never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no \nclue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrang path, envelop \nthem in enough smoke, and lly the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late. \nLAW 4 page 31 \nALWAYS SAY LESS THAN NECESSARY \nWhen you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less \nin control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended, \nand sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate lly saying less. The more you say, the more likely you \nare to say something foolish. \nLAW 5 page 37 \nSO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION-GU ARD IT WITH YOUR LIFE \nReputation is the corners tone of power. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win; once it slips, \nhowever, you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be \nalert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, leam to destroy your enem ies lly \nopening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and Let public opinion hang them. \nLAW 6 page44 \nCOURT ATTENTION AT ALL COST \nEverything is judged lly its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing. Never Let yourself get lost in the \ncrowd, then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost. Make yourself a magnet of attention \nlrj appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious than the bland and timid masses. \nCONTENTS ix \nLAW 7 page 56 \nGET OTHERS TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU, BUT ALWAYS TAKE THE CREDIT \nUse the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to furtker your own cause. Not only will such assis­\ntance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end \nyour helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you. \nLAW S page 62 \nMAKE OTHER PEOPLE COME TO YOU-USE BAIT IF NECESSARY \nWhen you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent \ncome to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains-then attack. You hold \nthe cards. \nLAW<) page69 \nWIN THROUGH YOUR AC TIONS, NEVER THROUGH ARGUMENT \nAny momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resent­\nment and ill will you stir up is stronger and !asts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much \nmore powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do \nnot explicate. \nLAW 10 page 76 \nINFECTION: AVOID THE UNHAPPY AND UNLUCKY \nYou can die from someone eises misery-emotional states are as infectious as diseases. You may feel you are \nhelping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw \nmisfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead. \nLA W 1 1 page 82 \nLEARN TO KEEP PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON YOU \nTo maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted.

A timely gift-a Trojan horse-will serve the same \npur pose. \nLA W 1.1 page 95 \nWHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEA L TO PEOPLE'S SELF-INTERE ST, \nNEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE \nIf you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your past assistance and good deeds. He \nwill find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that \nwill benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will res pond enthusiastically when he sees some­\nthing to be gained for himself. \nx CONTENT S \nLA W 14 page 101 \nPOSE AS A FRIEND , WORK AS A SPY \nKnowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead. \nBetter still: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, leam to probe. Ask indireet questions to get people \nto reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artjul spying. \nLAW 15 page 107 \nCRUSH YOUR ENEMY TOTALLY \nAll great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they \nhave leamed this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventu­\nally break out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover, \nand will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit. \nLAW 16 page 115 \nUSE ABSENCE TO INCREASE RESPECT AND HONOR \nToo much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you \nappear. If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked \nabout, even more admired. You must leam when to leave. Create value through scarcity. \nLA W 17 page 123 \nKEEP OTHERS IN SUSPENDED TERROR: CULTIVATE AN AIR OF UNPRE DlCTABI LlTY \nHumans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other people's aetions. Your pre­\ndietability gives them a sense of control. Tum the tables: Be deliberately unpredietable. Behavior that seems to \nhave no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain \nyour moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize. \nLA W 1 i:l page 130 \nDO NOT BUILD FORTRESSES TO PROTECT YOURSELF-ISOLATION IS DANGEROUS \nThe world is dangerous and enemies are everywkere-everyone has to proteet themselves. A fortress seems the \nsafest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you from-it cuts you off from valuable in­\nformation, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people, find allies, mingle. \nYou are shielded from your enemies by the crowd. \nLAW 19 page 137 \nKNOW WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH-DO NOT OFFEND THE WRONG PERSON \nThere are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to \nyour strategies in the same way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives \nseeking revenge. They are wolves in lambs' clothing. Choose your vietims and opponents carefully, then­\nnever offend or deceive the wrang person. \nCONTENTS Xl \nLAW 20 page 145 \nDO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE \nIt is the Jool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself. By maintaining \nyour independence, you become the master oJ others-playing people against one another, making them pursue \nyou. \nLAW 21 page156 \nPLAY A SUCKER TO CATCH A SUCKER-SEEM DUMBER THAN YOUR MARK \nNo one likes Jeeling stupider than the next person. The trick, then, is to make your victims Jeel smart-and not \nJust smart, but smarter than you are. Once convinced oJ this, they will never suspect that you may have ulttr \nrior motives. \nLAW 22 page 163 \nUSE THE SURRENDER TACTIC: TRANSFORM WEAKNESS INTO POWER \nWhen you are weaker, never fight Jor honor's sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to re­\ncover, time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait Jor his power to wane. Do not give him the sat­\nisJaction oJ fighting and deJeating you-surrender first. By turning the other cheek you inJuriate and unsettle \nhim. Make surrender a tool oJ power. \nLAW 23 page 171 \nCONCENTRATE YOUR FORCES \nConserve your Jorces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point. You gain more by find­\ning a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flittingjrom one shallow mine to another-intensity deJeats ex­\ntensity every time. When looking Jor sources oJ power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the Jat cow who \nwill give you milk Jor a long time to come. \nLAW 24 page 178 \nPLAY "

      "chapter_text": "THE PERFECT COURTIER \nThe perJect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity. He has \nmastered the art oJ indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the most oblique \nand graceJul manner. Learn and apply the laws oJ courtiership and there will be no limit to how Jar you can \nrise in the court. \nLAW 25 page 191 \nRE-CREATE YOUR S.ELF \nDo not accept the roles that society Joists on you. Re-create yourself by Jorging a new identity, one that com­\nmands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master oJ your own image rather than letting others dtr \nfine it Jor you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions-your power will be \nenhanced and your character will seem larger than life. \nLA W 26 page 200 \nKEEP YOUR HANDS CLEAN \nYou must seem a paragon oJ civility and efficiency: Your hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds. \nMaintain such a spotless appearance by using otkers as scapegoats and cat 's-paws to disguise your in­\nvolvement. \nxii CONTENT S \nLAW 27 page 215 \nPLAY ON PEOP LE'S NEED TO BEL IEVE TO CREATE A CUL TLIKE FOLL OWING \nPeople have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become the focal point of such desire by offering \nthem a cause, a new faith to follow. Keep your words vague but full of promise; emphasize enthusiasm over \nrationality and clear thinking. Give your new disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifi,ces on your \nbehalf. In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold \npower. \nLAW 28 page227 \nENTER ACTION WITH BO LDNESS \nIf you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execu­\ntion. Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit thrvugh audacity are eas­\nily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid. \nLAW 29 page 236 \nPLAN AL L THE WAY TO THE END \nThe ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles, \nand twists offortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By planning to the end \nyou will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help \ndetermine the future by thinkingfar ahead. \nLAW 30 page 245 \nMAKE YOUR ACCOMP LIS HMENTS SEEM EFFORT LESS \nYour actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also \nall the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. Avoid the \ntemptation of revealing how hard you work-it only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be \nused against you. \nLAW 31 page254 \nCONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH THE CARDS YOU DEAL \nThe best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in contral, \nbut are actually your puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose. Forr;e \nthem to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which seroe your purpose. Put them on the horns of \na dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn. \nLAW 32 page263 \nPLAY TO PEOP LE'S FANTASIES \nThe truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to tru,th and reality unless you are \nprepared for the anger that comes frvm disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can \nmanufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great \npower in tapping into the fantasies of the masses. \nCONTENT S xiii \nLAW 33 page271 \nDISCOVER EACH MAN'S THUMBSCREW \nEveryone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable \nemotion or need; it can also be a small secret pleasure. Either way, once Jound, it is a thumbscrew you can turn \nto your advantage. \nLA W :H page 282 \nBE ROYAL IN YOUR OWN FASHION: ACT LIKE A KING TO BE TREATED LIKE ONE \nThe way you carry yourself will oßen determine how you are treated: In the long TUn, appearing vulgar or com­\nmon will make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By \nacting regally and confident oJ your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown. \nLAW ,,5 page291 \nMASTER THE ART OF TIMING \nNever seem to be in a hurry-hurrying betrays a lack oJ control over yourself, and over time. Always seem pa­\ntient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective oJ the right moment; sniff \nout the spirit oJ the times, the trends that will carry you to power. Leam to stand back when the time is not yet \nripe, and to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition. \nLAW :16 page 300 \nDISDAIN THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE: IGNORING THEM IS THE BEST REVENGE \nBy acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy, \nthe stronger you make him; and a small mistake is oßen made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It \nis sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt Jor it. \nThe less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem. \nLAW �7 page309 \nCREATE COMPELLING SPECTACLES \nStriking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura oJ power-everyone responds to them. Stage spec­\ntacles Jor those around you, then, Jull oJ arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence. \nDazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing. \nLAW �g page 317 \nTHINK AS YOU LIKE BUT BEHAVE LIKE OTHERS \nIf you make a show oJ going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways, \npeople will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to \npunish you Jor making them Jeel inJerior. It is Jar saJer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your \noriginality only with tolerant Jriends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness. \nLA W :39 page 325 \nSTIR UP WATERS TO CATCH FISH \nAnger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But if you \ncan make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies \noff-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings. \nxiv CONTE NTS \nLAW 40 page 333 \nDESPISE THE FREE LUNCH \n'What is offered Jor Jree is dangerous-it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation.

Throughout \nhistory, a court has always formed itself around the person in power-king, \nqueen, emperor, leader. The courtiers who filled this court were in an espe­\ncially delicate position: They had to serve their masters, but if they seemed \nto fawn, if they curried favor too obviously, the other courtiers around \nthem would notice and would act against them. Attempts to win the mas­\nter's favor, then, had to be subtle. And even skilIed courtiers capable of \nsuch subtlety still had to protect themselves from their fellow courtiers, \nwho at all moments were scheming to push them aside. \nMeanwhile the court was supposed to represent the height of civiliza­\ntion and refinement. Violent or overt power moves were frowned upon; \ncourtiers would work silently and secretly against any among them who \nused force. This was the courtier's dilemma: Wh ile appearing the very \nparagon of elegance, they had to outwit and thwart their own opponents in \nthe subdest of ways. The successful courtier learned over time to make all \nof his moves indirect; if he stabbed an opponent in the back, it was with a \nvelvet glove on his hand and the sweetest of srniles on his face. Instead of \nusing coercion or outright treachery, the perfect courtier got his way \nthrough seduction, charm, deception, and subtle strategy, always planning \nseveral moves ahead. Life in the court was a never-ending game that re­\nquired constant vigilance and tactical thinking. It was civilized war. \nToday we face a peculiarly similar paradox to that of the courtier: \nEverything must appear civilized, decent, democratic, and fair. But if we \nplay by those rules too strictly, if we take them too literally, we are crushed \nby those around us who are not so foolish. As the great Renaissance diplo­\nmat and courtier Niccolö Machiavelli wrote, ''Any man who tries to be \ngood all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who \nare not good.\" The court imagined itself the pinnacle of refinement, but un-\nPREFACE xvii \nCourts are, unquestion­\nably, the seats of polite­\nness and good \nbreeding; were they not \nso, they wOllld be the \nseals of slallghter and \ndesolation.

Our world today similarly imagines it­\nself the pinnacle of fairness, yet the same ugly emotions still stir within us, \nas they have forever. The game is the same. Outwardly, you must seem to \nrespect the niceties, but inwardly, unless you are a fool, you learn quickly \nto be prudent, and to do as Napoleon advised: Place your iron hand inside \na velvet glove. If, like the courtier of times gone by, you can master the arts \nof indirection, leaming to seduce, charm, deceive, and subtly outmaneuver \nyour opponents, you will attain the heights of power. You will be able to \nmake people bend to your will without their realizing what you have done. \nAnd if they do not realize what you have done, they will neither resent nor \nresist you. \nTo some people the notion of consciously playing power game s---no mat­\nter how indirect-seems evil, asocial, a relic of the past. They believe they \ncan opt out of the game by behaving in ways that have nothing to do with \npower. You must beware of such people, for while they express such opin­\nions outwardly, they are often among the most adept players at power . \nThey utilize strategies that cleverly disguise the nature of the manipulation \ninvolved. These types, for example, will often display their weakness and \nlack of power as a kind of moral virtue. But true powerlessness, without \nany motive of self-interest, would not publicize its weakness to gain sympa­\nthy or respect. Making a show of one's weakness is actually a very effective \nstrategy, subtle and deceptive, in the game of power (see Law 22, the Sur­\nrender Tactic). \nAnother strategy of the supposed nonplayer is to demand equality in \nevery area oflife. Everyone must be treated alike, whatever their status and \nstrength. But if, to avoid the taint of power, you attempt to treat everyone \nequally and fairly, you will confront the problem that some people do cer­\ntain things better than others. Treating everyone equally means ignoring \ntheir differences, elevating the less skillful and suppressing those who \nexcel. Again, many of those who behave this way are actually deploying \nanother power strategy, redistributing people's rewards in a way that they \ndetermine. \nYet another way of avoiding the game would be perfect honesty and \nstraightforwardness, since one of the main techniques of those who seek \npower is deceit and secrecy. But being perfectly honest will inevitably hurt \nand insult a great many people, some of whom will choose to injure you in \nreturn. No one will see your honest statement as completely objective and \nfr"

But since \nall ofus hunger for power, and almost all of our actions are aimed at gain­\ning it, the nonplayers are merely throwing dust in OUf eyes, distracting us \nfrom their power plays with their air of moral superiority. If you observe \nthem closely, you will see in fact that they are often the ones most skillful at \nindirect manipulation, even if some of them practice it unconsciously. And \nthey greatly resent any publicizing of the tactics they use every day. \nIf the world is like a giant scheming court and we are trapped inside it, \nthere is no use in trying to opt out of the game. That will only render you \npowerless, and powerlessness will make you miserable. Instead of strug­\ngling against the inevitable, instead of arguing and whining and feeling \nguilty, it is far better to excel at power. In fact, the better you are at dealing \nwith power, the better friend, lover, husband, wife, and person you be­\ncome. By following the route of the perfect courtier (see Law 24) you learn \nto make others feel better about themselves, becoming a SOUfce of pleasure \nto them. They will grow dependent on YOUf abilities and desirous of YOUf \npresence. By mastering the 48 laws in this book, you spare others the pain \nthat comes from bungling with power-by playing with fire without know­\ning its properties.

It takes effort and years of practice, for much of \nthe game may not come naturally. Certain basic skills are required, and \nonce you master these skills you will be able to apply the laws of power \nmore easily. \nThe most important of these skills, and power's crucial foundation, is ] \nthe ability to master your emotions. An emotional response to a situation is \nthe single greatest barrier to power, amistake that will cost you a lot more \nthan any temporary satisfaction you might gain by expressing YOUf feel­\nings. Emotions cloud reason, and if you cannot see the situation clearly, \nyou cannot prepare for and respond to it with any degree of contro!. \nAnger is the most destructive of emotional responses, for it clouds \nyour vision the most. It also has a ripple effect that invariably makes situa­\ntions less controllable and heightens your enemy's resolve. If you are try­\ning to destroy an enemy who has hurt you, far better to keep hirn off-guard \nby feigning friendliness than showing your anger. KAUTILYA, \nINDIAN PHILOSOPJlFR, \nrHIRn CENTURY B.C. \nPREFACE xix \nI thought to myself \nwith wh at means, with \nwhat deceptions, with \nhow many va ried arts, \nwith what industry a \nman sharpens his wits \nto deceive another, \nand through these \nvariations the world is \nmade more beau tiful. \nFRANCESCO VETTO RI, \nCONTEMPORARY AND \nFRIEND OF \nM ACIIIAVELLI, \nEARLY SIXTEENTH \nCENTLJRY \nThere are no princi­\npies; there are only \nevents. There is no \ngood and bad, there are \nonly circumst ances. \nThe superior man \nespouses events and \ncircumstances in order \nto guide them. lf there \nwere principles and \nfixed laws, nations \nwould not change them \nas we change our shirts \nand a man can not be \nexpected to be wiser \nthan an entire nation. \nHONORE DF BALZAC', \n1799-1850 \nxx PREFACE Love and affection are also potentially destructive, in that they blind \nyou to the often self-serving interests of those whom you least suspect of \nplaying a power game. You cannot repress anger or love, or avoid feeling \nthem, and you should not try. But you should be careful about how you ex­\npress them, and most important, they should never influence your plans \nand strategies in any way. \nRelated to mastering YOUf emotions is the ability to distance YOUfseif \nfrom the present moment and think objectively about the past and future. \nLike Janus, the double-faeed Roman deity and guardian of all gates and \ndoorways, you must be able to look in both direetions at onee, the better to \nhandle danger from wherever it comes. Such is the face you must create for \nYOUfself-one face looking continuously to the future and the other to the \npast. \nFor the future, the motto is, \"No days unalert.\" No thing should catch \nyou by surprise because you are constantly imagining problems before \nthey arise. Instead of spending your time dreaming of YOUf plan's happy \nending, you must work on calculating every possible permutation and pit­\nfall that might emerge in it. The further you see, the more steps ahead you \nplan, the more powerful you become. \nThe other face of Janus looks constantly to the past-though not to re­\nmember past hUftS or bear grudges. That would only curb YOUf power . \nHalf of the game is learn ing how to forget those events in the past that eat \naway at you and doud YOUf reason. The real purpose of the backward­\nglancing eye is to educate YOUfseif eonstantly-you look at the past to learn \nfrom those who came before you. (The many historical examples in this \nbook will greatly help that process.) Then, having looked to the past, you \nlook doser at hand, to YOUf own aetions and those of YOUf friends. This is \nthe most vital school you ean learn from, because it comes from personal \nexperience. \nYou begin by examining the mistakes you have made in the past, the \nones that have most grievously held you back. You analyze them in terms \nof the 48 laws of power, and you extraet from them a lesson and an oath: \n\"I shall never repeat such amistake; I shall never fall into such a trap \nagain.\" If you can evaluate and observe yourself in this way, you can learn \nto break the patterns of the past-an immensely valuable skill. \nPower requires the ability to play with appearanees. To this end you \nmust learn to wear many masks and keep a bag full of deceptive tricks. De­\nception and masquerade should not be seen as ugly or immoral. All human \ninteraction requires deception on many levels, and in some ways what sep­\narates humans from animals is our ability to lie and deceive. In Greek \nmyths, in India's Mahabharata cyde, in the Middle Eastern epic of Gilga­\nmesh, it is the privilege of the gods to use deceptive arts; a great man, \nOdysseus for instance, was judged by his ability to riyal the craftiness of the \ngods, stealing some of their divine power by matching them in wits and de­\nception. Deeeption is a developed art of civilization and the most potent \nweapon in the game of power. \nYou cannot succeed at deception unless you take a somewhat dis­\ntanced approach to yourself-unless you can be many different people, \nwearing the mask that the day and the moment require. With such a flexi­\nble approach to all appearances, induding your own, you lose a lot of the \ninward heaviness that holds people down. Make your face as malleable as \nthe actor's, work to conceal your intentions from others, practice luring \npeople into traps.

They are also key compo­\nnents in the acquisition of power. \nIf deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then patience \nin all things is your crucial shield. Patience will protect you from making \nmoronic blunders. Like mastering your emotions, patience is a skill-it \ndoes not come naturall y. But nothing about power is natural; power is \nmore godlike than anything in the natural world. And patience is the \nsupreme virtue of the gods, who have nothing but time. Everything good \nwill happen-the grass will grow again, if you give it time and see several \nsteps into the future. Impatience, on the other hand, only makes you look \nweak. It is a principal impediment to power . \nPower is essentially amoral and one of the most imp ortant skills to ac­\nquire is the ability to see circumstances rather than good or evil. Power is a \ngame-this cannot be repeated too often-and in games you do not judge \nyour opponents by their intentions but by the effect of their actions. You \nmeasure their strategy and their power by what you can see and feel. How \noften are someone's intentions made the issue only to doud and deceive! \nWhat does it matter if another player, your friend or riyal, intended good \nthings and had only your interests at heart, if the effects of his action lead to \nso much ruin and confusion? It is only natural for people to cover up their \nactions with all kinds of justifications, always assuming that they have acted \nout of goodness. You must learn to inwardly laugh each time you hear this \nand never get caught up in gauging someone's intentions and actions \nthrough a set of moral judgments that are really an excuse far the accumu­\nlation of power. \nIt is agame. Your opponent sits opposite you. Both of you behave as \ngentl emen or ladies, observing the rules of the game and taking nothing \npers onally. You play with a strategy and you observe your opponent's \nmoves with as much calmness as you can muster. In the end, you will ap­\npreciate the politeness of those you are playing with more than their good \nand sweet intentions. Train your eye to follow the results of their moves, \nthe outward circumstances, and do not be distracted by anything else. \nHalf of your mastery of power comes from what you do not do, what \nyou do not allow yourself to get dragged into. For this skill you must learn \nto judge all things by what they cost you. As Nietzsche wrote, \"The value of \na thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it, but in what one pays \nfor it-what it costsus.\" Perhaps you will attain your goal, and a worthy goal \nat that, but at what price? Apply this standard to everything, induding \nwhether to collaborate with other people or come to their aid. In the end, \nPREFACE xxi \nxxii PREFACE life is short, opportunities are few, and you have only so much energy to \ndraw on. And in this sense time is as important a consideration as any \nother. Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of \nothers-that is too high a price to pay. \nPower is a social game. To leam and master it, you must develop the \nability to study and understand people. As the great seventeenth-century \nthinker and courtier Baltasar Graciän wrote: \"Many people spend time \nstudying the properties of animals or herbs; how much more important it \nwould be to study those of people, with whom we must live or die!\" To be a \nmaster player you must also be a master psychologist. You must recognize \nmotivations and see through the cloud of dust with which people surround \ntheir actions. An understanding of people's hidden motives is the single \ngreatest piece of knowledge you can have in acquiring power. It opens up \nendless possibilities of deception, seduction, and manipulation. \nPeople are of infinite complexity and you can spend a lifetime watch­\ning them without ever fully understanding them. So it is all the more im­\nportant, then, to begin your education now. In doing so you must also keep ( one principle in mind: Never discriminate as to whom you study and \ni whom you trust. Never trust anyone completely and study everyone, in­\ncluding friends and loved ones. \nFinally, you must leam always to take the indirect route to power. Dis­\nguise your cunning. Like a billiard ball that caroms several times before it \nhits its target, your moves must be planned and developed in the least ob­\nvious way. By training yourself to be indirect, you can thrive in the modem \ncourt, appearing the paragon of decency while being the consummate ma­\nnipulator. \nConsider The 48 Laws of Power a kind of handbook on the arts of indirec­\ntion. The laws are based on the writings of men and women who have \nstudied and mastered the game of power. These writings span aperiod of \nmore than three thousand years and were created in civilizations as dis­\nparate as ancient China and Renaissance Italy; yet they share common \nthreads and themes, together hinting at an essence of power that has yet to \nbe fully articulated. The 48 laws of power are the distillation of this accu­\nmulated wisdom, gathered from the writings of the most illustrious strate­\ngists (Sun-tzu, Clausewitz), statesmen (Bismarck, Talleyrand), courtiers \n(Castiglione, Graciän), seducers (Ninon de Lenclos, Casanova), and con \nartists (\"Yellow Kid\" Weil) in history. \nThe laws have a simple premise: Certain actions almost always in­\ncrease one's power (the observance of the law), while others decrease it \nand even ruin us (the transgression of the law). These transgressions and \nobservances are illustrated by historical examples. The laws are timeless \nand definitive. \nThe 48 Laws of Power can be used in several ways. By reading the book \nstraight through you can leam about power in general. Although several of \nthe laws may seem not to pertain directly to your life, in time you will \nprobably find that all of them have some application, and that in fact they \nare interrelated. By getting an overview of the entire subject you will best \nbe able to evaluate your own past actions and gain a greater degree of con­\ntrol over your immediate affairs. A thorough reading of the book will in­\nspire thinking and reevaluation long after you finish it. \nThe book has also been designed for browsing and for examining the \nlaw that seems at that particular moment most pertinent to you. Say you \nare experiencing problems with a superior and cannot understand why \nYOUf efforts have not lead to more gratitude or a promotion. Severallaws \nspecifically address the master-underling relationship, and you are almost \ncertainly transgressing one of them. By browsing the initial paragraphs for \nthe 48 laws in the table of contents, you can identify the pertinent law. \nFinally, the book can be browsed through and picked apart for enter­\ntainment, for an enjoyable ride through the foibles and great deeds of our \npredecessors in power. A warning, however, to those who use the book for \nthis purpose: It might be better to turn back. Power is endlessly seductive \nand deceptive in its own way. It is a labyrinth-your mind becomes con­\nsumed with solving its infinite problems, and you so on realize how pleas­\nantly lost you have become. In other words, it becomes most amusing by \ntaking it seriously. Do not be frivolous with such a critical matter. The gods \nof power frown on the frivolous; they give ultimate satisfaction only to \nthose who study and reflect, and punish those who skim the surfaces look­\ning for a good time. \nAny man who tries to be good alt the time is bound to come to ruin \namong the great number who are not good. Hence a prince who wants \nto keep his authority must leam how not to be good, and use that \nknowledge, or refrain from using it, as necessity requires. \nTHE PRINCE, Niccolo Mach iavelli, 7469-7527 \nPREFACE xxiii \nLAW \n1 \nNEVER OUTSHINE \nTHE MASTER \nJUDGMENT \nAlways make those above you feel comfortably superior. \nIn your desire to please and impress them, do not go too \nfar in displaying your talents or you might accomplish \nthe opposite-ins pire fear and insecurity.

      "chapter_text": "minis­\nter, Jules Mazarin, died, in 1661, the finance minister expected to be \nnamed the successor. Instead, the king decided to abolish the position. This \nand other signs made Fouquet suspect that he was falling out of favor, and \nso he decided to ingratiate hirnself with the king by staging the most spec­\ntacular party the world had ever seen. The party's ostensible purpose \nwould be to commemorate the completion of Fouquet's chateau, Vaux-Ie­\nVicomte, but its real function was to pay tribute to the king, the guest of \nhonor. \nThe most brilliant nobility of Europe and some of the greatest minds \nof the time-La Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Sevigne­\nattended the party. Moliere wrote a play for the occasion, in which he \nhirnselfwas to perform at the evening's conclusion. The party began with a \nlavish seven-course dinner, featuring foods from the Orient never be­\nfore tasted in France, as weH as new dishes created especiaHy for the night. \nThe meal was accompanied with music commissioned by Fouquet to \nhonor the king. \nMter dinner there was a promenade through the chateau's gardens. \nThe grounds and fountains of Vaux-Ie-Vicomte were to be the inspiration \nfor VersaiHes. \nFouquet personally accompanied the young king through the geomet­\nrically aligned arrangements of shrubbery and flower beds. Arrlving at the \ngardens' canals, they witnessed a fireworks display, which was followed by \nthe performance of Moliere's play. The party ran weH into the night and \neveryone agreed it was the most amazing affair they had ever attended. \nThe next day, Fouquet was arrested by the king's head musketeer, \nD' Artagnan. Three months later he went on trial for stealing from the \ncountry's treasury. (Actually, most ofthe stealing he was accused ofhe had \ndone on the king's behalf and with the king's permission.) Fouquet was \nfound guilty and sent to the most isolated prison in France, high in the \nPyrenees Mountains, where he spent the last twenty years of his life in soli­\ntary confinement. \nInterpretation \nLouis XN, the Sun King, was a proud and arrogant man who wanted to be \nthe center of attention at all times; he could not countenance being out­\ndone in lavishness by anyone, and certainly not his finance minister. To \nsucceed Fouquet, Louis chose Jean-Baptiste Colbert, a man famous for his \nparsimony and for giving the duHest parties in Paris. Colbert made sure \nthat any money liberated from the treasury went straight into Louis's \nhands. With the money, Louis built a palace even more magnificent than \nFouquet's-the glorious palace of Versailles. He used the same architects, \ndecorators, and garden designer. And at Versailles, Louis hosted parties \neven more extravagant than the one that cost Fouquet his freedom. \nLet us examine the situation. The evening of the party, as Fouquet pre­\nsented spectacle on spectacle to Louis, each more magnificent than the one \nbefore, he imagined the affair as demonstrating his loyalty and devotion to \nthe king. Not only did he think the party would put hirn back in the king's \nfavor, he thought it would show his good taste, his connections, and his \npopularity, making hirn indispensable to the king and demonstrating that \nhe would make an excellent prime minister. Instead, however, each new \nspectacle, each appreciative smile bestowed by the guests on Fouquet, \nmade it seem to Louis that his own friends and subjects were more \ncharmed by the finance minister than by the king hirnself, and that Fouquet \nwas actually flaunting his wealth and power. Rather than flattering Louis \nXIV, Fouquet's elaborate party offended the king's vanity. Louis would not \nadmit this to anyone, of course--instead, he found a convenient excuse to \nrid hirns elf of a man who had inadvertently made hirn feel insecure. \nSuch is the fate, in some form or other, of all those who unbalance the \nmaster's sense of self, poke holes in his vanity, or make hirn doubt his pre­\neminence. \nWhen the evening began, Fouquet was at the top 0/ the world. \nBy the time it had ended, he was at the bottom. \nVoltaire, 1694-1 778 \nOB SERVAN CE OF THE LAW \nIn the early 1600s, the ltalian astronomer and mathematician Galileo \nfound hirnself in a precarious position. He depended on the generosity of \ngreat rulers to support his research, and so, like all Renaissance scientists, \nhe would sometimes make gifts of his inventions and discoveries to the \nleading patrons of the time. Once, for instance, he presented a military \ncompass he had invented to the Duke of Gonzaga. Then he dedicated a \nbook explaining the use of the compass to the Medicis. Both rulers were \ngrateful, and through them Galileo was able to find more students to teach. \nNo matter how great the discovery, however, his patrons usually paid hirn \nwith gifts, not cash. This made for a life of constant insecurity and depen­\ndence. There must be an easier way, he thought. \nGalileo hit on a new strategy in 1610, when he discovered the moons \nof Jupiter. Instead of dividing the discovery among his patrons-giving \none the telescope he had used, dedicating a book to another, and so on-as \nhe had done in the past, he decided to focus exclusively on the Medicis. He \nchose the Medicis for one reason: Shortly after Cosimo I had established \nthe Medici dynasty, in 1540, he had made Jupiter, the mightiest of the \ngods, the Medici symbol-a symbol of apower that went beyond politics \nand banking, one linked to ancient Rome and its divinities . \nGalileo tumed his discovery of Jupiter's moons into a cosmic event \nLAW 1 3 \n4 LAW 1 honoring the Medicis' greatness. Shortly after the discovery, he announced \nthat \"the bright stars [the moons of Jupiterl offered themselves in the heav­\nens\" to his telescope at the same time as Cosimo II's enthroneme nt. He \nsaid that the number of the moons-four-harmonized with the number of \nthe Medicis (Cosimo 11 had three brothers) and that the moons orbited \nJupiter as these four sons revolved around Cosimo I, the dynasty's founder. \nMore than coincidence, this showed that the heavens themselves reflected \nthe ascendancy of the Medici family. After he dedicated the discovery to \nthe Medicis, Galileo commissioned an emblem representingJupiter sitting \non a cloud with the four stars circling about hirn, and presented this to \nCosimo 11 as a symbol of his link to the stars. \nIn 1610 Cosimo 11 made Galileo his official court philosopher and \nmathematician, with a full salary. For a scientist this was the coup of a life­\ntime. The days of begging for patronage were over. \nInterpretation \nIn one stroke, Galileo gained more with his new strategy than he had in \nyears of begging. The reason is simple: All masters want to appear more \nbrilliant than other people. \nThey do not care about science or empirical truth or the latest inven­\ntion; they care about their name and their glory. Galileo gave the Medicis \ninfinitely more glory by linking their name with cosmic forces than he had \nby making them the patrons of some new scientific gadget or discovery. \nScientists are not spared the vagaries of court life and patronage. They \ntoo must serve masters who hold the purse strings. And their great intellec­\ntual powers can make the master feel insecure, as if he were only there to \nsupply the funds-an ugly, ignoble job. The producer of a great work \nwants to feel he is more than just the provider of the financing. He wants to \nappear creative and powerful, and also more important than the work pro­\nduced in his name. Instead of insecurity you must give hirn glory. Galileo \ndid not challenge the intellectu� authority of the Medicis with his discov­\nery, or make them feel inferior in any way; by literally aligning them with \nthe stars, he made them shine brilliantly among the courts of Italy. He did \nnot outshine the master, he made the master outshine all others. \nKEYS TO POWER \nEveryone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world and dis­\nplay your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentrnent, envy, and \nother manifestations of insecurity. This is to be expected. You cannot spend \nyour life worrying about the petty feelings of others. With those above you, \nhowever, you must take a different approach: When it comes to power, \noutshining the master is perhaps the worst mi stake of all. \nDo not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much since the \ndays of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain high standing in life \nare like kings and queens: They want to fee"

      "chapter_text": "l secure in their positions, and \nsuperior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm. It is a deadly \nbut common misperception to believe that by displaying and vaunting \nYOUf gifts and talents, you are winning the master's affection. He may feign \nappreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace you with someone \nless intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis XIV replaced \nthe sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert. And as with Louis, he will \nnot admit the truth, but will find an excuse to rid hirnself of YOUf presence. \nThis Law involves two rules that you must realize. First, you can inad­\nvertently outshine a master simply by being YOUfself. There are masters \nwho are more insecure than others, monstrously insecUfe; you may natu­\nrally outshine them by YOUf charm and grace. \nNo one had more natural talents than Astorre Manfredi, prince of \nFaenza. The most handsome of all the young princes of Italy, he captivated \nhis subjects with his generosity and open spirit. \nIn the year 1500, Cesare Borgia laid siege to Faenza. When the city \nsurrendered, the citizens expected the worst from the cruel Borgia, who, \nhowever, decided to spare the town: He simply occupied its fortress, exe­\ncuted none of its citizens, and allowed Prince Manfredi, eighteen at the \ntime, to remain with his court, in complete freedom. \nA few weeks later, though, soldiers hauled Astorre Manfredi away to a \nRoman prison. A year after that, his body was fished out of the River \nTiber, a stone tied around his neck. Borgia justified the horrible deed with \nso me sort of trumped-up charge of treason and conspiracy, but the real \nproblem was that he was notoriously vain and insecure. The young man \nwas outshining hirn without even trying. Given Manfredi's natural talents, \nthe prince's mere presence made Borgia seem less attractive and charis­\nmatic. The lesson is simple: If you cannot help being charming and supe­\nrior, you must leam to avoid such monsters of vanity. Either that, or find a \nway to mute your good qualities when in the company of aCesare Borgia. \nSecond, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do \nanything you want. Entire books could be written about favorites who fell \nout of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to outshine. In \nlate-sixteenth-century Japan, the favorite of Emperor Hideyoshi was a man \ncalled Sen no Rikyu. The premier artist of the tea ceremony, which had be­\ncome an obsession with the nobility, he was one of Hideyoshi's most \ntrusted advisers, had his own apartment in the palace, and was honored \nthroughout Japan. Yet in 1591, Hideyoshi had hirn arrested and sentenced \nto death. Rikyu took his own life, instead. The cause for his sudden change \nof fortune was discovered later: It seems that Rikyu, former peasant and \nlater court favorite, had had a wooden statue made of hirnself wearing san­\ndals (a sign of nobility) and posing loftily. He had had this statue placed in \nthe most important temple inside the palace gates, in clear sight of the roy­\nalty who often would pass by. To Hideyoshi this signified that Rikyu had \nno sense of limits. Presuming that he had the same rights as those of the \nhighest nobility, he had forgotten that his position depended on the em­\nperor, and had co me to believe that he had earned it on his own. This was \nLAW 1 5 \n6 LAW 1 an unforgivable miscalculation of his own importance and he paid for it \nwith his life. Remember the following: Never take your position for \ngranted and never let any favors you receive go to your head. \nKnowing the dangers of outshining your master, you can turn this Law \nto your advantage. First you must flatter and puff up your master. Overt \nflattery can be effective but has its limits; it is too direct and obvious, and \nlooks bad to other courtiers. Discreet flattery is much more powerful. If \nyou are more intelligent than your master, for example, seem the opposite: \nMake hirn appear more intelligent than you. Act naive. Make it seem that \nyou need his expertise. Commit harmless mistakes that will not hurt you in \nthe long run but will give you the chance to ask for his help. Masters adore \nsuch requests. A master who cannot bestow on you the gifts of his experi­\nence may direct rancor and ill will at you instead. \nIf your ideas are more creative than your master's, ascribe them to \nhirn, in as public a manner as possible. Make it clear that your advice is \nmerely an echo of his advice. \nIf you surpass your master in wit, it is okay to play the role of the court \njester, but do not make hirn appear cold and surly by comparison. Tone \ndown your humor if necessary, and find ways to make hirn seem the dis­\npenser of amusement and good cheer. If you are naturally more sociable \nand generous than your master, be careful not to be the cloud that blocks \nhis radiance from others. He must appear as the sun around which every­\none revolves, radiating power and brilliance, the center of attention. If you \nare thrust into the position of entertaining hirn, a display of your limited \nmeans may win you his sympathy . Any attempt to impress hirn with your \ngrace and generosity can prove fatal: Learn from Fouquet or pay the price. \nIn all of these cases it is not a weakness to disguise your strengths if \nin the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain \nin control, instead of being a victim of their insecurity. This will all come in \nhandy the day you decide to rise above your inferior status. If, like Galileo, \nyou can make your master shine even more in the eyes of others, then you \nare a godsend and you will be instantly promoted. \nImage: \nThe Stars in the \nSky. There can be only \none sun at a time. Never \nobscure the sunlight, or \nriyal the sun's brilliance; \nrather, fade into the sky and \nfind ways to heighten \nthe master star's \nintensity. \nAuthority: Avoid outshining the master. All superiority is odious, but the \nsuperiority of a subject over his prince is not only stupid, it is fatal. This is a \nlesson that the stars in the sky teach us-they may be related to the sun, \nand just as brilliant, but they never appear in her company. (Baltasar \nGracian, 1601-165R) \nREVERSAL \nYou cannot worry about upsetting every person you corne across, but you \nmust be selectively cruel. If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing \nto fear from outshining hirn. Do not be merciful-your master had no such \nscruples in his own cold-blooded climb to the top. Gauge his strength. If he \nis weak, discreetly hasten his downfall: Outdo, outcharm, outsrnart hirn at \nkey moments . If he is very weak and ready to fall, let nature take its course. \nDo not risk outshining a feeble superior-it rnight appear cruel or spiteful. \nBut if your master is firm in his position, yet you know yourself to be the \nmore capable, bide your time and be patient. It is the natural course of \nthings that power eventually fades and weakens. Your master will fall \nsomeday, and if you play it right, you will outlive and sorneday outshine \nhirn. \nLAW 1 7 \n8 LAW \n2 \nNEVER PUT TOO MUCH \nTRUST IN FRIE NDS , LEARN \nHO W TO USE ENEMIES \nJUDGMENT \nBe wary of friends-they will betray you more quickly, for \nthey are easily aroused to envy. They also become spoiled \nand tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be \nmore loyal than a friend, because he has more to prove. \nIn fact, you have more to fear from friends than from en­\nemies. Ifyou have no enemies,jind a way to make them. \nTRANSGRESSIO N OF THE LAW \nIn the mid-ninth century A.D., a young man named Michael III assumed \nthe throne of the Byzantine Empire. His mother, the Empress Theodora, \nhad been banished to a nunnery, and her lover, Theoctistus, had been mur­\ndered; at the head of the conspiracy to depose Theodora and enthrone \nMichael had been Michael's unde, Bardas, a man of intelligence and ambi­\ntion. Michael was now a young, inexperienced mIer, surrounded by in­\ntriguers, murderers, and profligate s. In this time of peril he needed \nsomeone he could trust as his councillor, and his thoughts tumed to Basil­\nius, his best friend. Basilius had no experience whatsoever in govemment \nand politics-in fact, he was the head of the royal stables-but he had \nproven his love and gratitude time and again. \nThey had met a few years before, when Michael had been visiting the \nstables just as a wild horse got loose.

The groom's strength and \ncourage had impressed Michael, who immediately raised Basilius from the \nobscurity of being a horse trainer to the position of head of the stables. He \nloaded his friend with gifts and favors and they became inseparable. Basil­\nius was sent to the finest school in Byzantium, and the cmde peasant be­\ncame a cultured and sophisticated courtier. \nNow Michael was emperor, and in need of someone loyal. Who could \nhe better trust with the post of chamberlain and chief councillor than a \nyoung man who owed hirn everything? \nBasilius could be trained for the job and Michael loved hirn like a \nbrother. Ignoring the advice of those who recommended the much more \nqualified Bardas, Michael chose his friend. \nBasilius leamed weIl and was so on advising the emperor on all matters \nof state. The only problem seemed to be money-Basilius never had \nenough. Exposure to the splendor of Byzantine court life made hirn avari­\ncious for the perks of power. Michael doubled, then tripled his salary, en­\nnobled hirn, and married hirn off to his own mistress, Eudoxia Ingerina. \nKeeping such a trusted friend and adviser satisfied was worth any price. \nBut more trouble was to come. Bardas was now head of the army, and \nBasilius convinced Michael that the man was hopelessly ambitious. Under \nthe illusion that he could control his nephew, Bardas had conspired to put \nhirn on the throne, and he could conspire again, this time to get rid of \nMichael and assurne the crown hirnself. Basilius poured poison into \nMichael's ear until the emperor agreed to have his unde murdered. During \na great horse race, Basilius dosed in on Bardas in the crowd and stabbed \nhirn to death. So on after, Basilius asked that he replace Bardas as head of \nthe army, where he could keep control of the realm and quell rebellion. \nThis was granted. \nNow Basilius's power and wealth only grew, and a few years later \nMichael, in financial straits from his own extravagance, asked hirn to pay \nback some of the money he had borrowed over the years. To Michael's \nshock and astonishment, Basilius refused, with a look of such impudence To have a good enemy, \nchoose a [riend: He \nknows where to strike. \nDIANE DE POITIERS, \n1499-1566, MISTRESS OF \nHENRI II OF FRANCE \nEvery time I bestow a \nWlcant office I make a \nhund red discontented \npersons and one \ningrate. \nLOUIS XIV, 1638-1715 \nThus tor my own part \nI have more than once \nbeen deceived by the \nperson I loved most \nand o[ whose love, \nabove everyone else 's, \nI have been most c9nji­\ndent.

Then, after pro­\nclaiming hirnself emperor, he rode his horse through the streets of Byzan­\ntium, brandishing the head of his former benefactor and best friend at the \nend of a lang pike. \nInterpretation \nMichael III staked his future on the sense of gratitude he thought Basilius \nmust feel for hirn . Surely Basilius would serve hirn best; he owed the em­\nperor his wealth, his education, and his position. Then, once Basilius was in \npower, anything he needed it was best to give to hirn, strengthening the \nbonds between the two men. It was only on the fateful day when the em­\nperor saw that impudent smile on Basilius's face that he realized his deadly \nmistake. \nHe had created a monster. He had allowed a man to see power up \nclose-a man who then wanted more, who asked for anything and got it, \nwho feit encumbered by the charity he had received and simply did what \nmany people da in such a situat ion: They forget the favors they have re­\nceived and imagine they have eamed their success by their own merits . \nAt Michael 's moment ofrealization, he could still have saved his own \nlife, but friendship and love blind every man to their interests. Nobody be­\nlieves a friend can betray. And Michael went on disbelieving until the day \nhis head ended up on a pike . \nLord, protect me from my friends; I can take care of my enemies. \nValtaire, 1694-1 778 \nOBSER VANCE OF THE LAW \nFor several centuries after the fall of the Han Dynasty (A.D. 222), Chinese his­\ntory followed the same pattern of violent and bloody coups, one after the \nother. Army men would plot to kill a weak emperor, then would replace hirn \non the Dragon Throne with a strong general. The general would start a new \ndynasty and crown hirnself emperor; to ensure his own survival he would kill \noffhis fellow generals. A few years later, however, the pattern would resume: \nNew generals would rise up and assassinate hirn or his sons in their turn. To \nbe emperor of China was to be alone, sUITounded by a pack of enemies-it \nwas the least powerful, least secure position in the realm. \nIn A.D. 959, General Chao K'uang-yin became Em peror Sung. He \nknew the odds, the prob ability that within a year or two he would be mur­\ndered; how could he break the pattern? Soon after becoming emperor, \nSung ordered a banquet to celebrate the new dynasty, and invited the most \npowerful commanders in the army . Mter they had drunk much wine, he \nsomeone is repaying a kindnes.1: \nAFRICA N FOLK TA/I \ndismissed the guards and everybody else except the generals, who now \nfeared he would murder them in one fell swoop. Instead, he addressed \nthem: \"The whole day is spent in fear, and I am unhappy both at the table \nand in my bed. For which one of you does not dream of ascending the \nthrone? I do not doubt your allegiance, but if by some chance your subor­\ndinates, seeking wealth and position, were to force the emperor's yellow \nrobe upon you in turn, how could you refuse it?\" Drunk and fearing for \ntheir lives, the generals proclaimed their innocence and their loyalty. But \nSung had other ideas: \"The best way to pass one's days is in peaceful en­\njoyment of riches and honor. If you are willing to give up your commands, \nI am ready to provide you with fine estates and beautiful dwellings where \nyou may take your pleasure with singers and girls as your companions.\" \nThe astonished generals realized that instead of a life of anxiety and \nstru ggle Sung was offering them riches and security . The next day, all of \nthe generals tendered their resignations, and they retired as nobles to the \nestates that Sung bestowed on them. \nIn one stroke, Sung turned a pack of \"friendly\" wolves, who would \nlikely have betrayed hirn, into a group of docile lambs, far from all power . \nOver the next few years Sung continued his campaign to secure his \nrule. In A.D. 971, King Liu of the Southern Han finally surrendered to him \nafter years of rebellion. To Liu's astonishment, Sung gave hirn a rank in the \nimperial court and invited hir"

As King Liu took the glass that Sung offered hirn, he hesi­\ntated, fearing it contained poison. \"Your subject's crimes certainly merit \ndeath,\" he cried out, \"but I beg Your Majesty to spare your subject's life. In­\ndeed I dare not drink this wine.\" Emperor Sung laughed, took the glass \nfrom Liu, and swallowed it hirnself. There was no poison. From then on \nLiu became his �ost trusted and loyal friend . \nAt the time, China had splintered into many smaller kingdoms. When \nCh'ien Shu, the king of one of these, was defeated, Sung's ministers ad­\nvised the emperor to lock this rebel up. They presented documents prov­\ning that he was still conspiring to kill Sung. When Ch'ien Shu came to visit \nthe emperor, however, instead of locking hirn up, Sung honored hirn. He \nalso gave hirn a package, which he told the former king to open when he \nwas halfway horne. Ch'ien Shu opened the bundle on his return journey \nand saw that it contained all the papers documenting his conspir acy. He re­\nalized that Sung knew of his murderous plans, yet had spared hirn nonethe­\nless. This generosity won hirn over, and he too became one of Sung's most \nloyal vassals. \nInterpretation \nA Chinese proverb compares friends to the jaws and teeth of a dangerous \nanimal: If you are not careful, you will find them chewing you up. Em peror \nSung knew the jaws he was passing between when he assumed the throne: \nHis \"friends\" in the army would chew hirn up like meat, and if he some­\nhow survived, his \"friends\" in the government would have hirn for supper . There are many who \nthink therefore that a \nwise prince ollght, \nwhen he has the \nchance, to foment \nastl/tely same enmity, \nso that hy suppressillg \nit he will augment his \ngreatness. Princes, and \nespecially new ones, \nhave fOllnd more fäith \nand more usefulness in \nthose men, wh om at the \nheginning oftheir \npower they regarded \nwith slIspidon, than in \nthose they at first \ncon{ided in.

A.D. 55-120 \n12 LAW 2 Emperor Sung would have no truck with \"friends\" -he bribed his fellow \ngenerals with splendid estates and kept them far away. This was a much \nbetter way to emasculate them than killing them, which would only have \nled other generals to seek vengea nce. And Sung would have nothing to do \nwith \"friendly\" ministers. More often than not, they would end up drinking \nhis fam ous cup of poisoned wine. \nInstead of relying on friends, Sung used his enemies, one after the \nother, transforming them into far more reliable subjects. Wh ile a friend ex­\npects more and more favors, and seethes with jealousy, these former ene­\nmies expected nothing and got everything. A man suddenly spared the \nguillotine is a gratenIl man indeed, and will go to the ends of the earth for \nthe man who has pardoned hirn. In time, these former enemies became \nSung's most trusted friends. \nAnd Sung was finally able to break the pattern of coups, violence, and \ncivil war-th e Sung Dynasty ruled China for more than three hundred \nyears. \nIn a speech Abraham Lincoln delivered at the height of the Civil War, \nhe referred to the Southerners as fellow human beings who were in \nerroT. An elderly lady chastised him for not calling them irreconcilable \nenemies who must be destroyed. \"Why, madam,\" Lincoln replied, \n\"do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?\" \nKEY S TO POWE R \nIt is natural to want to employ your friends when you find yourself in times \nof need. The world is a harsh place, and your friends soften the har shness. \nBesides, you know them. Wh y depend on astranger when you have a \nfriend at hand ? \nThe problem is that you often do not know your friends as weIl as you \nimagin e. Friends often agree on things in order to avoid an argument. \nThey cover up their unpleasant quali ties so as to not offend each other. \nThey laugh extra hard at each other's jokes. Since honesty rarely strength­\nens friendship, you may never know how a friend truly feels. Friends will \nsay that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste in \nclothes-maybe they mean it, often they do not. \nWhen you decide to hire a friend, you gradually discover the qualit ies \nhe or she has kept hidden. Strangely enough, it is your act of kindne ss that \nunbala nces everything. People want to feel they des erve their good for­\ntune. The receipt of a favor can become oppressive : It means you have \nbeen chosen because you are a friend, not necessa rily because you are de­\nserving. There is almost a touch of condescension in the act of hiring \nfriends that secretly afflicts them. The injury will come out slowly : A little \nmore honesty, flashes of resentment and envy here and there, and before \nyou know it your friendship fades. The more favors and gifts you supply to \nrevive the friendship, the less gratitude you receive. \nIngratitu de has a long and deep histor y. It has demonstrated its powers \nfor so many centurie s, that it is truly amazing that people continue to un­\nderestimate them. Better to be wary. If you never expect gratitude from a \nfriend, you will be pleasa ntly surprised when they do prove grateful . \nThe problem with using or hiring friends is that it will inevitably limit \nyour power. The friend is rarely the one who is most able to help you; and \nin the end, skill and competence are far more important than friendly feel­\nings. (Michael III had a man right under his no se who would have steered \nhirn right and kept hirn alive: That man was Bardas .) \nAll working situations require a kind of dista nce between people. You \nare trying to work, not make friends; friendliness (real or false) only ob­\nscures that fact. The key to power, then, is the ability to judge who is best \nable to further your interests in all situatio ns. Keep friends for friendship, \nbut work with the skilIed and competent . \nYour enemies, on the other hand, are an untapped gold mine that you \nmust learn to exploit. When Talleyrand , Napoleon's foreign minister, de­\ncided in 1807 that his boss was leading France to ruin, and the time had \ncome to turn against hirn, he understood the dangers of conspiring against \nthe emperor; he needed a partner, a confedera te--what friend could he \ntrust in such a pro ject? He chose Joseph Fouc he, head of the secret police, \nhis most hated enemy, a man who had even tried to have hirn assassinated. \nHe knew that their former hatred would create an opportunity for an emo­\ntional reconciliation. He knew that Fouche would expect nothing from \nhirn, and in fact would work to prove that he was worthy of Talleyrand's \nchoice; a person who has somet hing to prove will move mountains for you. \nFinally, he knew that his relationship with Fouche would be based on mu­\ntual self-in terest, and would not be contaminated by personal feeling. The \nselection proved perfect; although the conspirators did not succeed in top­\npling Napoleon, the union of such powerful but unlikely partners gener­\nated much interest in the cause; opposition to the emperor slowly began to \nspread. And from then on, Talleyrand and Fouche had a fruitful working \nrelati onship . Whenever you can, bury the hatc het with an enemy, and \nmake a point of putting hirn in your service. \nAs Lincoln said, you destroy an enemy when you make a friend of \nhirn.

In 1937 the \nJapanese invaded China, interrupting the civil war between Mao's Com­\nmunists and their enemy, the Nationalists. \nFearing that the Japanese would wipe them out, some Communist \nleaders advocated leaving the Nationalists to fight the Japanese, and using \nthe time to recuperate. Mao disagreed: The Japanese could not possibly \ndefeat and occupy a vast country like China for long. Once they left, the \nCommunists would have grown rusty if they had been out of combat for \nseveral years, and would be ill prepared to reopen their struggle with the \nNationalists. To fight a formidable foe like the Japanese, in fact, would be \nthe perfect training for the Communists' ragtag army. Mao's plan was \nadopted, and it worked: By the time the Japanese finally retreated, the \nCommunists had gained the fighting experience that helped them defeat \nthe Nationalists. \nYears later, a Japanese visitor tried to apologize to Mao for his coun­\ntry's invasion of China. Mao interrupted, \"Should I not thank you in­\nstead?\" Without a worthy opponent, he explained, a man or group cannot \ngrow stronger. \nMao's strategy of constant conflict has several key components. First, \nbe certain that in the long run you will emerge victorious. Never pick a \nfight with someone you are not sure you can defeat, as Mao knew the \nJapanese would be defeated in time. Second, if you have no apparent ene­\nmies, you must sometimes set up a convenient target, even tuming a friend \ninto an enemy. Mao used this tactic time and again in politics. Third, use \nsuch enemies to define your cause more clearly to the public, even framing \nit as a struggle of good against evil. Mao actually encouraged China's dis­\nagreements with the Soviet Union and the United States; without clear-cut \nenemies, he believed, his people would lose any sense of what Chinese \nCommunism meant. A sharply defined enemy is a far stronger argument \nfor your side than all the words you could possibly put together. \nNever let the presence of enemies upset or distress you-you are far \nbetter off with a declared opponent or two than not knowing where your \nreal enemies lie. The man of power welcomes conflict, using enemies to \nenhance his reputation as a surefooted fighter who can be relied upon in \ntimes of uncertainty. \nImage: The Jaws of Ingratitude. \nKnowing what would happen Autho rity: \nKnow how to use \nif you put a finger In \nthe mouth of a !ion, \nyou would stay \nclear of it. \nWith friends \nyou will have \nno such caution, and \nif you hire them, they will enemies for your own \nprofit. You must learn to grab a \nsword not by its blade, which would \ncut you, but by the handle, which allows \nyou to defend YOUfself. The wise man \nprofits more from his enemies, \nthan a fool from his friends. \neat you alive with ingratitude. (Baltasar Gracian, \n1601-1658) \nREVERSAL \nAlthough it is generally best not to mix work with friendship, there are \ntimes when a friend can be used to greater effect than an enemy. A man of \npower, for example, often has dirty work that has to be done, but for the \nsake of appearances it is generally preferable to have other people do it for \nhim; friends often do this the best, since their affection for hirn makes them \nwilling to take chances. Also, if YOUf plans go awry for some reason, you \ncan use a friend as a convenient scapegoat. This \"fall of the favorite\" was a \ntrick often used by kings and sovereigns: They would let their dosest friend \nat court take the fall for amistake, since the public would not believe that \nthey would deliberately sacrifice a friend for such a purpose. Of course, \nafter you play that card, you have lost your friend forever. It is best, then, to \nreserve the scapegoat role for someone who is dose to you but not too \nelose. \nFinally, the problem ab out working with friends is that it confuses the \nboundaries and distances that working requires. But if both partners in the \narrangement understand the dangers involved, a friend often can be em­\nployed to great effect. You must never let YOUf guard down in such a ven­\nture, however; always be on the lookout for any signs of emotional \ndisturbance such as envy and ingratitude. Nothing is stable in the realm of \npower, and even the dosest offriends can be transformed into the worst of \nenemies. \nLAW 2 15 \n16 LAW \n3 \nCO NCE AL YO UR \nINTENTI ONS \nJUDGM ENT \nKeep people oJJ-balance and in the dark by never reveal­\ning the pur pose behind your actions.

At first Ninon was amused to hear the \nmarquis talk ahout his mistake s, hut finally she had had enough . Unahle to \nhear ineptitude in any realm, least of all in seducing a woman, she decided \nto take the young man under her wing. First, hE\\ had to und erstand that this \nwas war, and that the heautiful countess was a Citadel to which he had to \nlay siege as carefully as any general. Every step had to he planned and exe­\ncuted with the utmost attention to detail and nuance. \nInstructing the marquis to start over, Ninon told him to approach the \ncountess with a hit of distance, an air of nonchala nce. The next time the \ntwo were alone together, she said, he would confide in the countess as \nwould a friend hut nota poten tial lover. This was to throw her offthe scent. \nThe countess was no longer to take his interest in her for granted-p erhaps \nhe was only interested in friendship. \nNinon planned ahead.

This \nhea utiful young woman had equally hea utiful friends, so that wherever the \ncountess would now see the marquis, he would he surround ed hy the most \nstunning young women in Paris. Not only would the countess he seething \nwith jealousy, she would come to see the marquis as someone who was de­\nsired hy othe rs. It was hard far Ninon to make the marquis understand, hut \nshe patiently explained that a woman who is interested in a man wants to \nsee that other women are interested in him, to�. Not only does that give \nhim instant value, it makes it all the more satisfying to snatch him from \ntheir clutc hes. \nOnce the countess was jealous hut intrigue d, it would he time to he­\nguil e her. On Ninon's instructions, the marquis would fail to show up at af­\nfairswhere the countess expected to see him. Then, suddenly, he would \nappear at salons he had never frequented hefore, hut that the countess at-\nLAW 3 17 \n18 LAW 3 tended often. She would be unable to predict his moves. All of this would \npush her into the state of emotional confusion that is aprere quisite for suc­\ncessful seduct ion. \nThese moves were executed, and took several weeks. Ninon moni­\ntored the marquis's progr ess: Through her network of spies, she heard how \nthe countess would laugh a litde harder at his witticisms, listen more \nclosely to his stories . She heard that the countess was suddenly asking ques­\ntions about hirn. Her friends told her that at social affairs the countess \nwould often look up at the marquis, following his steps. Ninon feJt certain \nthat the young woman was falling under his spell. It was a matter of weeks \nnow, maybe a month or two, but if all went smoothly, the citadel would \nfall. \nA few days later the marquis was at the countess's horne. They were \nalone. Suddenly he was a different man: This time acting on his own im­\npulse, rather than following Ninon's instructions, he took the countess's \nhands and told her he was in love with her. The young woman seemed \nconfused, areaction he did not expect. She became polite, then excused \nherself. For the rest of the evening she avoided his eyes, was not there to \nsay good-night to hirn. The next few times he visited he was told she was \nnot at horne. When she finally admitted hirn again, the two feIt awkward \nand uncomfortable with each other. The spell was broken. \nInterpretation \nNinon de Lenclos knew everything about the art of love. The greatest writ­\ners, thinkers, and politicians of the time had been her lovers-men like La \nRochefoucauld, Moliere, and Richelieu. Seduction was agame to her, to be \npracticed with skill. As she got older, and her reputation grew, the most im­\nportant families in France would send their sons to her to be instructed in \nmatters oflove. \nNinon knew that men and women are very different, but when it \ncomes to seduction they feel the same: Deep down inside, they often sense \nwhen they are being seduced, but they give in because they enjoy the feel­\ning of being led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to allow the other per­\nson to detour you into a stra nge country. Everything in seduction, \nhowever, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce yOUf intentions or \nreveal them direcdy in words. Instead you must throw your targets off the \nscent. To surrender to YOUf guidance they must be appropriately confused. \nYou have to scramble your signals -appear interested in another man or \nwoman (the decoy), then hint at being interested in the target, then feign \nindifference, on and on. Such patterns not only confuse, they excite. \nImagine this story from the countess's persp ective: After a few of the \nmarquis's moves, she sensed the marquis was playing some sort of game, \nbut the game delighted her. She did not know where he was leading her, \nbut so much the better. His moves intrigued her, each of them keeping her \nwaiting for the next one--she even enjoyed her jealousy and confusion, for \nsometimes any emotion is better than the boredom of securi ty. Perhaps the \nmarquis had uIterior motives; most men do. But she was willing to wait and \nsee, and probably if she had been made to wait long enough, what he was \nup to would not have mat tered. \nThe moment the marquis utte red that fatal word \"love,\" however, all \nwas changed. This was no longer agame with moves, it was an artless show \nof passion. His intention was revealed: He was seducing her. This put \neverything he had done in a new light. All that before had been charming \nnow seemed ugly and conniving; the countess feit embarrassed \"and used. \nA door closed that would never open again. \nDo not be held a cheat, even though it is impossible to live today without being one. \nLet your greatest cunning lie in covering up what looks like cunning. \nBaltaSflT Graritin. 1601-16 58 \nOBSER VA NCE OF THE LAW \nIn 1850 the young Otto von Bismarck, then a thirt y-five-year-old deputy in \nthe Prussian parliament, was at a turning point in his career . The issues of \nthe day were the unification of the many states (including Prussia) into \nwhich Germany was then divided, and a war against Austria, the powerful \nneighbor to the south that hoped to keep the Germans weak and at odds, \neven threatening to intervene if they tried to unite. Prince William, next in \nline to be Prussia's king, was in favor of going to war, and the parliament \nrallied to the cause, prepared to back any mobilization of troops. The only \nones to oppose war were the present king, Frederick William IV, and his \nministers, who preferred to appease the powerful Austrians. \nThroughout his career, Bismarck had been a loyal, even passionate \nsupporter of Prussian might and power. He dreamed of German unifica­\ntion, of going to war against Austria and humiliating the country that for so \nlong had kept Germany divided. A former soldier, he saw warf are as a glo­\nrious business. \nThis, after all, was the man who years later would say, \"The great \nquestions of the time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions, but \nby iron and blood.\" \nPassionate patriot and lover of military glory, Bismarck nevertheless \ngave a speech in parliament at the height of the war fever that astonished \nall who heard it. \"Woe unto the stat esman,\" he said, \"who makes war with­\nout a reason that will still be valid when the war is over! After the war, you \nwill all look differently at these questions. Will you then have the courage \nto turn to the peasant contemplating the ashes of his farm, to the man who \nhas been crippled, to the father who has lost his children?\" Not only did \nBismarck go on to talk of the madness of this war, but, strangest of all, he \npraised Austria and defended her actions. This went against everything he \nhad stood for. The consequences were immediate. Bismarck was against \nthe war-what could this possibly mean? Other deputies were confused, \nand several of them changed their votes. Eventually the king and his minis­\nters won out, and war was averted. \nA few weeks after Bismarck's infamous speech, the king, grateful that \nLAW 3 19 \n20 LAW 3 he had spoken for peace, made hirn a cabinet minister. A few years later he \nbecame the Prussian premier. In this role he eventuaIly led his country and \na peace-loving king into a war against Austria, crushing the former empire \nand establishing a mighty German state, with Prussia at its head. \nInterpretation \nAt the time of his speech in 1850, Bismarck made several calculati ons. \nFirst, he sensed that the Prussian military, which had not kept pace with \nother European armies, was unready for war-that Austria, in fact, might \nvery weIl win, a disastrous result for the future . Second, if the war were lost \nand Bismarck had supported it, his career would be gravely jeopardized. \nThe king and his conserv ative ministers wanted peace; Bisma rck wanted \npower. The answer was to throw people off the scent by supporting a cause \nhe detested, saying things he would laugh at if said by another. A whole \ncountry was fooled. It was because of Bismarck's speech that the king made \nhirn aminister, a position from which he quickly rose to be prime minister, \nattaining the power to strengthen the Prussian military and accomplish \nwhat he had wanted all along: the humiliation of Austria and the unifica­\ntion of Germany under Prus sia's leadership. \nBismarck was certainly one of the cleverest state sman who ever lived, \na master of strategy and deception. No one suspected what he was up to in \nthis case."

      "chapter_text": " Had he ann ounced his real intent ions, arguing that it was better \nto wait now and fight later, he would not have won the argument, since \nmost Prussians wanted war at that moment and mistakenly believed that \ntheir army was superior to the Austrians. Had he played up to the king, \nasking to be made a minister in exchange for supporting peace, he would \nnot have succeeded either : The king would have distrusted his ambition \nand doubted his sincerity. \nBy being completely insincere and sending misleading signal s, how­\never, he deceived everyone, concealed his purpose, and attained every­\nthing he wante d. Such is the power of hiding your intent ions. \nKEYS TO PO WER \nMost people are open books. They say what they feel, blurt out their opin­\nions at every opportunity, and constantly reveal their plans and intent ions. \nThey do this for several reasons. First, it is easy and natural to always want \nto talk about one's feelings and plans for the future. It takes effort to control \nyour tongue and monitor what you reveal. Second, many believe that by \nbeing honest and open they are winning people's hearts and showing their \ngood natu re.T hey are greatly deluded. Honesty is actually a blunt instru­\nment, which bloodies more than it cuts . Your honesty is likely to offend \npeople; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what \nthey want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you feel or \nthink. More important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so \npredictable and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or fear you, \nand power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions. \nIf you yearn for power, quickly lay honesty aside, and train yourself in \nthe art of concealing your intentions. Master the art and you will always \nhave the upper hand. Basic to an ability to conceal one's intentions is a \nsimple truth about human nature: Our first instinct is to always trust ap­\npearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of what we see and \nhear-constantly imagining that appearances concealed something else \nwould exhaust and terrify uso This fact makes it relatively easy to conceal \none's intentions. Simply dangle an object you seem to desire, a goal you \nseem to aim for, in front of people's eyes and they will take the appearance \nfor reality. Once their eyes foeus on the decoy, they will fail to notice what \nyou are really up to. In seduction, set up conflictin �signals, such as desire \nand indifference, and you not only throw them off the scent, you inflame \ntheir desire to possess you. \nA tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to appear to \nsupport an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own sentiment s. \n(Bismarck used this to great effect in his speech in 1850.) Most people will \nbelieve you have experienced a change of heart, since it is so unusual to \nplay so lightly with something as emotional as one's opinions and values. \nThe same applies for any decoyed object of desire: Seem to want some­\nthing in which you are actually not at all interested and your enemies will \nbe throWll off the scent, making all kinds of errors in their calculatio ns. \nDuring the War of the Spanish Succession in 1711, the Duke of Marl­\nborough, head of the English army, wanted to destroy a key French fort, \nbecause it proteeted a vital thoroughfare into Franee. Yet he knew that if he \ndestroyed it, the French would realize what he wanted-to advance down \nthat road. Instead, then, he merely captured the fort, and garrisoned it with \nsome of his troops, making it appear as if he wanted it for some purpose of \nhis OWll. The French attaeked the fort and the duke let them reeapture it. \nOnce they had it back, though, they destroyed it, figuring that the duke had \nwanted it for some important reason. Now that the fort was gone, the road \nwas unprotected, and Marlborough could easily march into France. \nUse this tactie in the following manner: Hide your intentions not by \nclosing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspi­\ncious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals-just not yOUf \nreal ones. You will kill three birds with one stone: You appear friendly, \nopen, and trusting; you conceal YOUf intentions; and you send YOUf rivals \non time-consuming wild-goose ehases. \nAnother powerful tool in throwing people off the scent is false sineer­\nity. People easily mistake sincerity for honesty. Remember-their first in­\nstinet is to trust appearances, and sinee they value honesty and want to \nbelieve in the honesty of those around them, they will rarely doubt you or \nsee through YOUf aet. Seeming to believe what you say gives your words \ngreat weight. This is how Iago deceived and destroyed Othello: Given the \ndepth of his emotions, the apparent sincerity of his coneems about Desde­\nmona's supposed infidelity, how eould Othello distrust hirn? This is also \nhow the great con artist Yellow Kid Weil pulled the wool over suckers' \neyes: Seeming to believe so deeply in the deeoyed object he was dangling \nLAW 3 21 \n22 LAW 3 in front of them (a phony stock, a touted racehors e), he made its reality \nhard to doubt. It is important, of course, not to go too far in this area. Sin­\ncerity is a tricky tool: Appear overpassionate and you raise suspicions. Be \nmeasured and believable or your ruse will seem the put-on that it iso \nTo make your false sincerity an effective weapon in concealing your \nintentions, espouse a belief in honesty and forthrigh tness as important so­\ncial values. Do this as publicly as possible. Emphasize your position on this \nsubject by occasionally divulging some heartfelt thought-though only one \nthat is actually meaning less or irrelevant, of course. Napoleon's minister \nTalleyrand was a master at taking people into his confidence by revealing \nsome apparent secret. This feigned confidence-a decoy -would then \nelicit areal confidence on the other person's part. r Rememb er: The best deceivers do everything they can to cloak their \nroguish qual ities. They cultivate an air of honesty in one area to disguise \nI their dishonesty in others. Honesty is merely another decoy in their arsenal \n) of weap ons. \nJ.... \nPART II: USE SMOK E SCREENS TO \nDISGUISE YO UR ACTI ONS \nDeception is always the best strategy, but the best deceptions require a screen \nof smoke to distract people's attention from your real pur pose. The bland \nexterior-like the unreadable poker face-is often the perfect smoke screen, \nhiding your intentions behind the comfortable and familiar. If you lead the \nsucker down a familiar path, he won 't catch on when you lead him into a \ntrap. \nOBSER VA NCE OF THE LAW I \nIn 1910, a Mr. Sam Geezil of Chicago sold his warehouse business for close \nto $1 million. He settled down to semiretirement and the managing of his \nmany properties, but deep inside he itched for the old days of deal-making. \nOne day a young man namedJoseph Weil visited his office, wanting to buy \nan apartment he had up for sale. Geezil explained the terms : The price was \n$8,000, but he only required a down payment of $2,000. Weil said he \nwould sleep on it, but he came back the following day and offered to pay \nthe full $8,000 in cash, if Geezil could wait a couple of days, until a deal \nWeil was working on came through. Even in semiretirement, a clever busi­\nnessman like Geezil was curious as to how Weil would be able to come up \nwith so much cash (roughly $150,000 today) so quickly. Weil seemed reluc­\ntant to say, and quickly changed the subj ect, but Geezil was persistent. Fi­\nnally, after assurances of confidentiality, Weil told Geezil the following \nstory. \nWeil's uncle was the secretary to a coterie of multimillionaire fi­\nnanciers. These wealthy gentlemen had purchas ed a hunting lodge in \nMichigan ten years ago, at a cheap price. They had not used the lodge for a \nfew years, so they had decided to seIl it and had asked Weil's uncle to get \nwhatever he could for it. For reasons -go od reasons-of his own, the uncle \nhad been nursing a grudge against the millionaires for years ; this was his \nchance to get back at them. He would seIl the property for $35,000 to a set­\nup man (whom it was Weil's job to find) . The financiers were too wealthy to \nworry about this low price. The set-up man would then turn around and \nseIl the property again for its real price, around $155,000. The uncle, Weil, \nand the third man would split the profits from this se"

Weil was \nreluctant to involve hirn, but Geezil would not back down : The idea of a \nlarge profit, plus a little adventure, had hirn champing at the bit. Weil ex­\nplained that Geezil would have to put up the $35,000 in cash to bring the \ndeal off. Geezil, a millionaire, said he could get the money with a snap of \nhis fing ers. Weil finally relented and agreed to arrange a meeting between \nthe uncle, Geezil, and the financiers, in the town of Galesburg, Illin ois. \nOn the train ride to Galesburg, Geezil met the uncle-an impressive .1 1\"111 r \"I\"<: OF ISHAE I.. \nH·:IC\\S \\\\ OHSIlIP Oie \nTlfl·: IDOL BA·A L \nThen fehu assembl ed \nall the people, and said \nto them, \"Ahab served \nBa' al a fittle; but fehu \nwill serve hirn much \nmore.

Weil ex­\nplained to Geezil that he hirnself was a boxing trainer, that Gross was one \nof the promising prizefighters he trained, and that he had asked Gross to \ncome along to make sure the fighter stayed in shape. For a promising \nfighter, Gross was unimpressive look ing-he had gray hair and a beer \nbelly-but Geezil was so excited about the deal that he didn't really think \nab out the man's flabby appeara nce. \nOnce in Galesburg, Weil and his uncle went to fetch the financiers \nwhile Geezil waited in a hotel room with Gross, who promptly put on his \nboxing trunks. As Geezil half watch ed, Gross began to shadow box. Dis­\ntracted as he was, Geezil ignored how badly the boxer whe ezed after a few \nminutes of exercise, although his style seemed real enough. An hour later, \nWeil and his uncle reappeared with the financ iers, an impressive, intimidat­\ning group of men, all wearing fancy suits. The meeting went well and the fi­\nnanciers agreed to sell the lodge to Geezil, who had already had the \n$35,000 wired to a local bank. \nThis minor business now settle d, the financiers sat back in their chairs \nand began to banter about high financ e, throwing out the name 'j. P. Mor­\ngan\" as if they knew the man. Finally one of them noticed the boxer in the \ncorner of the room. Weil explained what he was doing there. The financier \ncountered that he too had a boxer in his entourage, whom he named. Weil \nlaughed brazenly and exclaimed that his man could easily knock out their \nman. Conversation escalated into argument. In the heat of passion, Weil \nchallenged the men to a bet. The financiers eagerly agreed and left to get \ntheir man ready for a fight the next day. \nAs soon as they had left, the uncle yelled at Weil, right in front of \nGeezil: They did not have enough money to bet with, and once the fi­\nnanciers discovered this, the uncle would be fired. Weil apologized for get­\nting hirn in this mess, but he had a plan : He knew the other boxer well, and \nwith a little bribe, they could fix the fight. But where would the money \ncome from for the bet? the uncle replie d. Without it they were as good as \ndead. Finally Geezil had heard enough. Unwilling to jeop ardize his deal \nwith any ill will, he offered his own $35,000 cash for part of the bet. Even if \nhe lost that, he would wire for more money and still make a profit on the \nsale of the lodge. The uncle and nephew thanked hirn. With their own \n$15,000 and Geezil's 1$35,000 they would manage to have enough for the \nbet. That evening, as Geezil watched the two boxers rehearse the fix in \nthe hotel room, his mind reeled at the killing he was going to make from both \nthe boxing match and the sale of the lodge. \nThe fight took place in a gym the next day. Weil handled the cash, \nwhich was placed for security in a locked box. Everything was pro­\nceeding as planned in the hotel room. The financiers were looking glum at \nhow badly their fighter was doing, and Geezil was dreaming about the easy \nmoney he was about to make . Then, suddenly, a wild swing by the fi­\nnanc ier's fighter hit Gross hard in the face, knocking hirn down. When he \nhit the canvas, blood spurted from his mouth. He coughed, then lay still. \nOne of the financiers, a former doctor, checked his pulse; he was dead. The \nmillionaires panicked: Everyone had to get out before the police arrived­\nthey could all be charged with murder. \nTerrified, Geezil hightailed it out of the gym and back to Chicago, leav­\ning behind his $35,000 which he was only too glad to forget, for it seemed \na small price to pay to avoid being implicated in a crime. He never wanted \nto see Weil or any of the others again. \nAfter Geezil scurried out, Gross stood up, under his own steam. The \nblood that had spurted from his mouth came from a ball filled with chicken \nblood and hot water that he had hidden in his cheek. The whole affair had \nbeen masterminded by Weil, better known as \"the Yellow Kid,\" one of the \nmost creative con artists in history. Weil split the $35,000 with the fi­\nnanciers and the boxers (all fellow con artists)-a nice little profit for a few \ndays' work. SI\\E.�K AC ROSS 'j'1 Jf: \n0(:1-:,\\:\\ L\\ BHOAD \nDAYL!

He had failed to notice that Gross was out of \nshape and middle-aged at best. Such is the distracting power of a smoke \nscreen.

That is when you gently guide hirn onto the \nsecond path, the slippery slope down which he slides helplessly into your \ntrap. \nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 11 \nIn the mid-1920s, the powerful warlords of Ethiopia were coming to the re­\nalization that a young man of the nobility named Haile Selassie, also \nknown as Ras Tafari, was outcompeting them all and nearing the point \nwhere he could prodaim hirnself their leader, unifying the country for the \nfirst time in decades. Most of his rivals could not understand how this \nwispy, , quiet, mild-mannered man had been able to take control. Yet in \nLAW 3 25 \n26 LAW 3 1927, Selassie was able to summon the warlords, one at a time, to come to \nAddis Ababa to declare their loyalty and recognize bim as leader. \nSome hurried, some hesitated, but only one, Dejazmach Balcha of \nSidamo, dared defy Selassie totally. A blustery man, Balcha was a great \nwarrior, and he considered the new leader weak and unworthy. He point­\nedly stayed away from the capital. Finally Selassie, in his gentle but stern \nway, commanded Balcha to come. The warlord decided to obey, but in \ndoing so he would turn the tables on this pretender to the Ethiopian \nthrone: He would come to Addis Ababa at his own speed, and with an \narmy of 10,000 men, a force large enough to defend hirnself, perhaps even \nstart a civil war. Stationing this formidable force in a valley three rniles \nfrom the capital, he waited, as a king would. Selassie would have to come \nto bim. \nSelassie did indeed send emissaries, asking Balcha to attend an after­\nnoon banquet in his honor. But Balcha, no fool, knew history-he knew \nthat previous kings and lords of Ethiopia had used banquets as a trap. \nOnce he was there and full of drink, Selassie would have hirn arrested or \nmurdered. To signal his understanding of the situation, he agreed to come \nto the banquet, but only if he could bring his personal bodyguard-600 of \nbis best soldiers, all armed and ready to defend hirn and themselves. To \nBalcha's surprise, Selassie answered with the utmost politeness that he \nwould be honored to play host to such warriors. \nOn the way to the banquet, Balcha warned his soldiers not to get \ndrunk and to be on their guard. When they arrived at the palace, Selassie \nwas his charrning best. He deferred to Balcha, treated hirn as if he desper­\nately needed his approval and cooperation. But Balcha refused to be \ncharmed, and he warned Selassie that if he did not return to his camp by \nnightfall, his army had orders to attack the capital. Selassie reacted as if \nhurt by his mistrust. Over the meal, when it came time for the traditional \nsinging of songs in honor of Ethiopia' s leaders, he made a point of allowing \nonly songs honoring the warlord of Sidamo. It seemed to Balcha that Se­\nlassie was scared, intimidated by this great warrior who could not be out­\nwitted. Sensing the change, Balcha believed that he would be the one to \ncall the shots in the days to come. \nAt the end of the afternoon, Balcha and his soldiers began their march \nback to camp arnidst cheers and gun salutes. Looking back to the capital \nover his shoulder, he planned his strategy-how his own soldiers would \nmarch through the capital in triumph within weeks, and Selassie would be \nput in his place, his place being either prison or death. When Balcha came \nin sight of bis camp, however, he saw that something was terribly wrong. \nWhere before there had been colorful tents stretching as far as the eye \ncould see, now there was nothing, only smoke from doused fires. What \ndevil's magie was this? \nA witness told Balcha what had happened. During the banquet, a large \narmy, commanded by an ally of Selassie's, had stolen up on Balcha's en­\ncampment by a side route he had not seen. This army had not come to \nfight, however: Knowing that Balcha would}lave heard a noisy battle and \n/ \nhurried back with his 600-man bodyguard, Selassie had ,armed his own \ntroops with baskets of gold and cash. They had sUITou nded Balcha' s army \nand proceeded to purchase every last one of their weapons. Those who re­\nfused were easily intimidated. Within a few hours, Balcha's entire force had \nbeen disarmed and scattered in all directions. \nRealizing his danger, Balcha decided to march south with his 600 sol­\ndiers to regroup, but the same army that had disarmed his soldiers blocked \nhis way. The other way out was to march on the capital, but Selas sie had set \na large army to defend it. Like a chess player, he had predicted Balcha's \nmoves, and had checkrnated hirn. For the first time in his life, Balcha sur­\nrendered. To repent his sins of pride and ambition, he agreed to enter a \nmonastery. \nInterpretation \nThroug hout Selass ie's long reign, no one could quite figure hirn out. \nEthiopians like their leaders fierce, but Selassie, who wore the front of a \ngentle, peace-loving man, lasted longer than any of them. Never angry or \nimpatient, he lured his victims with sweet smiles, lulling them with charm \nand obsequi ousness before he attac ked. In the case of Balcha, Selassie \nplayed on the man's warine ss, his suspicion that the banquet was a trap-­\nwhich in fact it was, but not the one he expected. Selassie's way of allaying \nBalcha' s fears-letting him bring his bodyguard to the banquet, giving hirn \ntop billing there, making him feel in control--created a thick smoke screen, \nconcealing the real action three miles away. \nRem ember: The paranoid and wary are often th"

A helpful or apparently honest ge sture, or one that implies the other \nperson's superiority- these are perfect diversionary devices. \nProperly set up, the smoke screen is a weapon of great power.

The best deceivers utilize a \nbland and inconspicuous front that calls no attention to themsel ves. They \nknow that extravagant words and ge stures immediately raise suspicion. In­\nstead, they envelop their mark in the familiar, the banal, the harmless. In \nYellow Kid Weil's dealings with Sam Geezil, the familiar was a business \ndeal. In the Ethiopian case, it was Selass ie's misleading obsequiousness­\nexactly what -Balcha would have expected from a weaker warlord. \nLAW 3 27 \n28 LAW 3 Once you have lulled your suckers' atte ntion with the familiar, they \nwill not notice the deception being perpetrated behind their backs. This \nderives from a simple truth : people can only focus on one thing at a time. It \nis really too difficult for them to imagine that the bland and harmless per­\nson they are dealing with is simulta neously setting up something else. The \ngrayer and more uniform the smoke in your smoke screen, the better it \nconceals your intent ions. In the decoy and red herring devices discussed in \nPart I, you actively distract people; in the smoke screen, you lull your vic­\ntims, drawing them into your web. Because it is so hypnotic, this is often \nthe best way of concea ling your intent ions. \nThe simplest form of smoke screen is facial expression. Behind abland, \nunreadable exte rior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned, without detection. \nThis is a weapon that the most powerful men in history have learned to per­\nfect. It was said that no one could read Franklin D. Roosevelt's face. Baron \nJames Rothschild made a lifelong practice of disguising his real thoughts be­\nhind bland smiles and nondescript looks. Stendhal wrote of Talleyrand, \n\"Never was a face less of a barometer. \" Henry Kissinger would bore his op­\nponents around the negotiating table to tears with his monotonous voice, \nhis blank look, his endless recitations of detai ls; then, as their eyes glazed \nover, he would suddenly hit them with a list of bold terms. Caught off­\nguard, they would be easily intimida ted. As one poker manual explains it, \n\"W hile playing his hand, the good player is seldom an actor. Instead he \npractices abland behavior that minimizes readable patterns, frustrates and \nconfuses opponents, "

      "chapter_text": "permits greater concent rati on.\" \nAn adaptable concept, the smoke screen can be pract iced on a num­\nber of levels, all playing on the psychological principles of distraction and \nmisdirection. One of the most effective smoke screens is the noble gesture. \nPeople want to believe apparently noble gestures are genuin e, for the belief \nis pleasant. They rarely notice how deceptive these gestures can be. \nThe art dealer Joseph Duveen was once confront ed with a terrible prob­\nlem. The millionaires who had paid so dearly for Duveen's paintings were \nrunning out of wall space, and with inheritance taxes getting ever higher, it \nseemed unlikely that they would keep buying. The solution was the Nati onal \nGallery of Art in Wa shington, D.C., which Duveen helped create in 1937 by \ngetting An drew Mellon to donate his collection to it. The National Gallery \nwas the perfect front for Duveen. In one gesture, his clients avoided taxes, \ncleared wall space for new purchas es, and reduced the number of paintings \non the market, maintaining the upward pressure on their prices. All this \nwhile the donors created the appearance of being public benef actors. \nAn other effective smoke screen is the pattern, the establishment of a se­\nries of actions that seduce the victim into believing you will continue in the \nsame way. The pattern plays on the psychology of antic ipation: Our behav­\nior conforms to patterns, or so we like to think. \nIn 1878 the Am erican robber baronJay Gould created a company that \nbegan to threaten the monopoly of the telegraph company We stern Union. \nThe directors of We stern Union decided to buy Gould's company up-\nthey had to spend a hefty sum, but they figured they had managed to rid \nthemselves of an irritating competitor. A few months later, though, Gould \nwas it at again, complaining he had been treated unfairly. He started up a \nsecond company to compete with Western Union and its new acquisition. \nThe same thing happened again: Western Union bought hirn out to shut \nhirn up. Soon the pattern began for the third time, but now Gould went for \nthe jugular: He suddenly staged a bloody takeover struggle and managed \nto gain complete control of Western Union. He had established a pattern \nthat had tricked the company' s directors into thinking his goal was to be \nbought out at a handsome rate. Once they paid hirn off, they relaxed and \nfailed to notice that he was actually playing for higher stake s. The pattern is \npowerful in that it deceives the other person into expecting the opposite of \nwhat you are really doing. \nAnother psychological weak ness on which to construct a smoke screen \nis the tendency to mistake appearances for reality-the feeling that if some­\none seems to belong to your group, their belonging must be real. This habit \nmakes the seamless blend a very effective front. The trick is simple: You sim­\nply blend in with those around you. The better you blend, the less suspi­\ncious you become. During the Cold War of the 1950s and '60s, as is now \nnotorious, a slew of British civil servants passed secrets to the Soviets. They \nwent undetected for years because they were apparently decent chaps, had \ngone to all the right schools, and fit the old-boy network perfectly. Blend­\ning in is the perfect smoke screen for spying. The better you do it, the bet­\nter you can conceal your intentions. \nRememb er: It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant colors, \nto put on the mask of the inconspicu ous. Do not despair at having to wear \nsuch abland mask-it is often your unreadability that draws people to you \nand makes you appear a person of power. \nImage: A Sheep's Skin. \nA sheep never marauds, \na sheep never deceives, \na sheep is magnificently \ndumb and docile. With a \nsheepskin on his back, \na fox can pass right \ninto the chicken coop. \nAuthority: Have you ever heard of a skillful general, who intends to \nsurprise a citadel, announcing his plan to his enemy? Conceal your \npurpose and hide your progress; do not disclose the extent of your \ndesigns until they cannot be opposed, until the combat is over. Win \nthe victory before you declare the war. In a word, imitate those war­\nlike people whose designs are not known except by the ravaged coun­\ntry through which they have passed. (Ninon de Lenclos, 1623-1706) \nLAW 3 29 \nI\nI30 LAW 3 REVERSAL \nNo smoke screen , red herr ing, fals e sincerity, or any other diver sionar y de­\nvice will succeed in concealing your intention s if you alread y have an es­\ntabli shed reputation for deception. And as you get older and achieve \nsucc e ss, it often become s increasingly diffic ult to disguis e your cunning. \nEver yone know s you practice deception; persist in playing naive and you \nrun the ris k of seeming the ranke s t hypocrite, which will severel y limit \nyour room to maneuver. In such cases it is better to own up, to appear the \nhone s t rogue , or, better , the repentant rogue. No t only will you be admired \nfor your frank ness, but, mos t wonder ful and strange of all, you will be able \nto continue your stratagem s. \nAs P. T. Barnu m , the nineteenth- centur y king of humbugger y, grew \nolder , he learn ed to embra c e his reputation as a grand deceiver. At one \npoint he organized a buffalo hunt in Ne w Jersey, complete with Indians \nand a few imported buffalo. He publi cized the hunt as genuine , but it came \noff as so complet ely fake that the crowd , instead of getting angry and ask­\ning for their mone y back, was greatl y amu sed. The y knew Barnum pulled \ntricks all the time; that was the secret of his success, and they loved him for \nit. Learn ing a lesson from this affa ir, Barn um stopped concealing all of his \ndevi ces, even revealing his deception s in a tell-all autobiograph y. As \nKierkegaard wrote , \"The world want s to be deceived.\" \nFinall y, although it is wiser to divert attention from your purpo ses by \npresenting abland , familiar exterior , there are time s when the colorfu l, \nconspicuous gesture is the right diver sionar y tactic. The great charlatan \nmountebank s of seventeenth -and eighteenth- centur y Europe used humor \nand entertai nment to deceive their audien ces.

In the first half of the fifth century B.C. he won many impor­\ntant batt les, saving the city from calamity time and time again. Because he \nspent most ofhis time on the battlefield, few Romans knew him persona lly, \nmaking him something of a legendary figure . \nIn 454 B.C., Coriolanus decided it was time to exploit his reputation \nand enter politics. He stood for election to the high rank of consul . Candi­\ndates for this position traditionally made a public address early in the race, \nand when Coriolanus came before the people, he began by displaying the \ndozens of scars he had accumulated over seventeen years of fighting for \nRome. Few in the crowd really heard the lengthy speech that followed; \nthose scars, proof of his valor and patriot ism, moved the people to tears . \nCoriolan us's election seemed certain . \nWhen the polling day arriv ed, however, Coriolanus made an entry \ninto the forum escorted by the entire senate and by the city's patricians, the \naristocracy. The common people who saw this were disturbed by such a \nblustering show of confidence on election day. \nAnd then Coriolanus spoke again, mostly addressing the wealthy citi­\nzens who had accompanied him. His words were arrogant and insolent. \nClaiming certain victory in the vote, he boasted of his battlefield exploits, \nmade sour jokes that appealed only to the patrici ans, voiced angry accusa­\ntions against his opponents, and speculated on the riches he would bring to \nRome. This time the people listene d: They had not realized that this leg­\nendary soldier was also a common braggart. \nNews of Coriolan us's second speech spread quickly through Rome, \nand the people turned out in great numb ers to make sure he was not \nelected. Defeate d, Coriolanus returned to the battl efield, bitter and vowing \nrevenge on the common folk who had voted against him. Same weeks later \na large shipment of grain arrived in Rome. The senate was ready to distrib­\nute this food to the people, for free, but just as they were prepa ring to vote \non the question Coriolanus appeared on the scene and took the senate \nfloor. The distributi on, he argu ed, would have a harmful effe ct on the city \nas a whole. Several senators appeared won over, and the vote on the distri­\nbution fell into doubt. Coriolanus did not stop there : He went on to con­\ndemn the concept of democracy itself. He advo cated getting rid of the \npeople's represe ntatives-the tribunes-and turning over the governing of \nthe city to the patricians. \nWh en word of Coriolan us's latest speech reache d the people, their \nanger knew no bounds. The trib unes were sent to the senate to demand \nthat Coriolanus appear before them. He refused. Riots broke out all over \nthe city. The senate, fearing the people's wrath, finally voted in favor of the \ngrain distribut ion. The tribunes were appeased, but the people still de­\nmande d that Coriolanus speak to them and apologi ze. If he repented, and \nagreed to keep his opinions to himself , he would be allowed to return to \nthe batt lefield. \nCoriolanus did appear one last time before the people, who listened to \nhirn in rapt silence. He started slowly and softly, but as the speech went on, \nhe became more and more blunt. Yet again he hurled insults ! His tone was \narrogant, his expression disdai nful. The more he spoke, the angrier the \npeople became. Finally they shouted hirn down and silenced hirn. \nThe tribunes conferred, condemned Coriolanus to death, and ordered \nthe magistrates to take hirn at once to the top of the Tarpeian rock and \nthrow hirn over. The delighted crowd seconded the decision. The patri­\ncians, however, managed to intervene, and the sentence was commuted to \na lifelong banishment. When the people found ou t that Rome's great mili­\ntary hero would never return to the city, they celebrated in the streets. In \nfact no one had ever seen such a celebration, not even after the defeat of a \nforeign enemy. \nInterpretation \nBefore his entrance into politics, the name of Coriolanus evoked awe. \nHis battl efield accomplishments showed hirn as a man of great brav­\nery. Since the citizens knew little about hirn, all kinds of legends became at­\ntached to his name. The moment he appeared before the Roman citizens, \nhowever, and spoke his mind, all that grandeur and mystery vanished. He \nbragged and blustered like a common soldier. He insulted and slandered \npeople, as if he felt threatened and insecure. Suddenly he was not at all \nwhat the people had imagi ned. The discrepancy between the legend and \nthe reality proved immensely disappo inting to those who wanted to be­\nlieve in their hero. The more Coriolanus said, the less powerful he ap­\npeared-a person who cannot control his words shows that he cannot \ncontrol hirnse lf, and is unworthy of respect. \nHad Coriolanus said less, the people would never have had cause to \nbe offended by hirn, would never have known his true feelings.

They would confer, argue, make and break \nalliances, and argue again, until finally the critical moment arrived: Two of \nthem would be chosen to represent the different sides to Louis hirnse lf, \nwho would decide what should be done. After these persons were chosen, question from \nKissinger -Lord \nsnapped, \"Damn it, yes, \nit's the best I can do.\" \nTo wh ich Kissinger \nreplied: \"Fine, then I \nguess I'll read it this \ntime.\" \nKISSINGER, \nWALTER ISAACSON, \n1992 \nThe King [Louis XIV ; \nmaintains the most \nimpenetrable secrecy \nabout affairs of State. \nThe ministers attend \ncouncil meetings, but \nhe confides his plans to \nthem only when he has \nreflected at length upon \nthem and has come to \na definite decision. \nI wish you might see \nthe King.

Humans are machines \nof interpretation and explanation; they have to know what you are think­\ning. When you carefully control what you reveal, they cannot pierce yOUf \nintentions or your meaning. \nYOUf short answers and silences will put them on the defensive, and \nthey will jump in, nervously filling the silence with all kinds of comments \nthat will reveal valuable information about them and their weaknesses. \nThey will leave a meeting with you feeling as if they had been robbed, and \nthey will go horne and ponder YOUf every word. This extra attention to \nYOUf brief comments will only add to your power. \nSaying less than necessary is not for kings and statesmen only. In most \nareas of life, the less you say, the more profound and mysterious you ap­\npear. As a young man, the artist Andy Warhol had the revelation that it was \ngenerally impossible to get people to do what you wanted them to do by \ntalking to them. They would turn against you, subvert YOUf wishes, disobey \nyou out of sheer perversity. He once told a friend, \"I leamed that you actu­\nally have more power when you shut up.\" \nIn his later life Warhol employed this strategy with great success. His \ninterviews were exercises in oracular speech: He would say something \nvague and ambiguous, and the interviewer would twist in circles trying to \nfigure it out, imagining there was something prafound behind his often \nmeaningless phrases. Warhol rarely talked ab out his work; he let others do \nthe interpreting. He claimed to have leamed this technique from that mas­\nter of enigma Marcel Duchamp, another twentieth-century artist who real­\nized early on that the less he said about his work, the more people talked \nabout it. And the more they talked, the more valuable his work became. \nBy saying less than necessary you create the appearance of meaning \nand power. Also, the less you say, the less risk you run of saying something \nfoolish, even dangerau s. In 1825 a new czar, Nicholas I, ascended the \nthrone of Russia. Arebellion immediately broke out, led by liberals de­\nmanding that the country moderniz e-that its industries and civil struc­\ntures catch up with the rest of Europe. Brutally crushing this rebellion (the \nDecembrist Uprising) , Nicholas I sentenced one of its leaders, Kondraty \nRyleyev, to death. On the day of the execution Ryleyev stood on the gal­\nlows, the noose around his neck. The trapdoor opened-but as Ryleyev \ndangled, the rape brake, dashing hirn to the ground. At the time, events \nlike this were considered signs of providence or heavenly will, and a man \nsaved from execution this way was usually pardoned. As Ryleyev got to his \nfeet, bruised and dirtied but believing his neck had been saved, he called \nout to the crowd, \"You see, in Russia they don't know how to do anything \nproperly, not even how to make rape!\" \nA messenger immediately went to the Winter Palace with news of the \nfailed hanging. Vexed by this disappointing turnabout, Nicholas I never­\ntheless began to sign the pardon. But then: \"Did Ryleyev say anything after \nthis miracle?\" the czar asked the messenger. \"Sire,\" the messenger replied, \n\"he said that in Russia they don't even know how to make rope.\" \n\"In that case,\" said the Czar, \"let us prove the contrary,\" and he tore \nup the pardon. The next day Ryleyev was hanged again. This time the \nrope did not break. \nLearn the lesson: Once the words are out, you cannot take them back. \nKeep them under control. Be particularly careful with sarcasm: The mo-\nLAW 4 35 \n36 LAW 4 mentary satisfacti on you gain with your biting words will be outweighed by \nthe price you pay. \nIma ge : \nThe Orade at Delphi. \nWhen vi si tors consulted the \nOrade, the priestess would utter \na few enigmatic words that seemed \nfull of me aning and import. No one \ndisobeyed the words of the Oracle­\nthey held power over life and dea th. \nAuthority: Never start moving your own lips and teeth before \nthe subordinates do. The longer I keep quiet, the sooner others \nmove their lips and teeth . As they move their lips and teeth, I \ncan thereby understand their real intentions .... If the sovereign \nis not mysterious, the ministers will find oppor tunity to take \nand take. (Han-fei-tzu, Chinese philosopher, third century B.C.) \nREVERS AL \nThere are times when it is unwise to be silent. Silence can arouse suspicion \nand even insecurity, espec ially in your superi ors; a vague or ambig uous \ncomment can open you up to interpretations you had not barga ined for. Si­\nlence and saying less than necessary must be practiced with cauti on, then, \nand in the right situat ions. It is occasionally wiser to imitate the court jester, \nwho plays the fool but knows he is smarter than the king. He talks and talks \nand entertains, and no one suspects that he is more than just a foo1. \nAlso, words can sometimes act as a kind of smoke screen for any de­\nception you might pract ice. By bending your listener' s ear with talk, you \ncan distract and mesmerize them; the more you talk, in fact, the less suspi­\ncious of you they become. The verbose are not perceived as sly and ma­\nnipulative but as helpless and unsophisticate d. This is the reverse of the \nsilent policy employed by the powerful : By talking more, and making \nyourself appear weaker and less intelligent than your mark, you can prac­\ntice deception with greater ease. \nLAW \n5 \nSO MU CH DEP EN DS ON \nREPUT ATI ON- GU AR D IT \nWITH YO UR LIFE \nJUDGMENT \nReputation is the cornerstone of power.

He lit some incense, \nstrummed his lute, and began to chant. Minutes later he could see the vast \nenemy army approaching, an endless phalanx of soldiers. Pretending not \nto notice them, he continued to sing and play the lute. \nSoon the army stood at the town gates, At its head was Sima Yi, who \ninstantly recognized the man on the wall. \nEven so, as his soldiers itched to enter the unguarded town through its \nopen gates, Sima Yi hesitated, held them back, and studied Liang on the \nwall. Then, he ordered an immediate and speedy retreat. \nInterpretation \nChuko Liang was commonly known as the \"Sleeping Dragon.\" His ex­\nploits in the War of the Three Kingdoms were legendary. Once a man \ndaiming to be a disaffected enemy lieutenant came to his camp, offering \nhelp and information. Liang instantly recognized the situation as a setup; \nthis man was a false deserter, and should be beheaded. At the last minute, \nthough, as the ax was about to fall, Liang stopped the execution and of­\nfered to spare the man's life if he agreed to become a double agent. Grate­\nful and terrified, the man agreed, and began supplying false information to \nthe enemy. Liang won battle after battle. \nOn another occasion Liang stole a military seal and created false docu­\nments dispatching his enemy's troops to distant locations. Once the troops \nhad dispersed, he was able to capture three eities, so that he controlled an \nentire corridor of the enemy's kingdom. He also once tricked the enemy \ninto believing one of its best generals was a traitor, forcing the man to es­\ncape and join forces with Liang. The Sleeping Dragon carefully cultivated \nhis reputation of being the deverest man in China, one who always had a \ntrick up his sleeve. As powerful- as any weapon, this reputation struck fear \ninto his enemy. \nSima Yi had fought against Chuko Liang dozens of times and knew \nhirn weIl. When he came on the empty city, with Liang praying on the \nwall, he was stunned. The Taoist robes, the chanting, the incense--this had \nto be agame of intimidat ion. The man was obviously taunting hirn, daring \nhirn to walk into a trap. The game was so obvious that for one moment it \ncrossed Yi's mind that Liang actually was alone, and desperate . But so \ngreat was his fear of Liang that he dared not risk finding out. Such is the \npower of reputation. It can put a vast army on the defensive, even force \nthem into retreat, without a single arrow being fired. \nFoT, as Cicero says, even those who argue against fame still want the books they \nwrite against it to bear their name in the title and hope to become famous for \ndespising it. Everything else is subject to barter: we will let our Jriends have \nour goods and our lives if need be; but a case of sharing our fame and \nmaking someone else the gift of our reputation is hardly to be found. \nMont aigne, 1533-1592 \nOBSER VA NCE OF THE LAW II \nIn 1841 the young P. T. Barnum, trying to establish his reputation as Amer­\nica's premier showman, decided to purchase the American Museum in \nManhattan and turn it into a collection of curiosities that would secure his \nfarne. The problem was that he had no money. The museum's asking price \nwas $15,000, but Barnum was able to put together a proposal that appealed \nto the institution's owners even though it replaced cash up front with \ndozens of guarantees and references. The owners came to a verbal agree­\nment with Barnum, but at the last minute, the principal partner changed \nhis mind, and the museum and its collection were sold to the directors of \nPeale's Museum. Barnum was infuriated, but the partner explained that \nbusiness was business-the museum had been sold to Peale's because \nPeale's had areputation and Barnum had none. \nBarnum immediately decided that if he had no reputation to bank on, \nhis only recourse was to ruin the reputation of Peale's. Accordingly he \nlaunched a letter-writing campaign in the newspapers, calling the owners a \nbunch of \"broken-down bank directors\" who had no idea how to run a mu­\nseum or entertain people. He warned the public against buying Peale's \nstock, since the business's purchase of another museum would invariably \nspread its resources thin. The campaign was effective, the stock plum­\nmeted, and with no more confidence in Peale's track record and reputa­\ntion, the owners of the American Museum reneged on their deal and sold \nthe whole thing to Barnum. \nIt took years for Peale's to recover, and they never forgot what Bar­\nnum had done. Mr. Peale hirnself decided to attack Barnum by building a \nreputation for \"high-brow entertainment,\" promoting his museu m's pro­\ngrams as more scientific than those of his vulgar competitor. Mesmerism \n(hypnotism) was one of Peale's \"scientific\" attractions, and for a while it \ndrew big crowds and was quite successful. To fight back, Barnum decided \nto attack Peale's reputation yet again. \nBarnum organized a riyal mesmeric performance in which he hirnself \napparently put a little girl into a trance. Once she seemed to have fallen \ndeeply under, he tried to hypnotize members of the audience--but no mat­\nter how hard he tried, none of the spectators fell under his speIl, and many \nof them began to laugh. A frustrated Barnum finally announced that to \nprove the little girl's trance was real, he would cut off one of her fingers many a sheep \nWho'd injured me in \nno re.\\'pect, \nAnd even in my time \nbeen known to try \nShepherd pie. \nlf need be, then, f'll die. \nYet I suspect \nThat others also ought \nto own their \"ins. \nIt's only fair that all \nshould do their hest \nTo single out the \nguiltiest. \" \n\"Sire, you 're too good \na king,\" the Fox hegins; \n\"Such scruples are too \ndelicate.

Peale's reputa­\ntion, on the other hand, never reeovered. \nInterpretation \nBarnum used two different taeties to ruin Peale's reputation. The first was \nsimple: He sowed doubts about the museum 's stability and solveney. \nDoubt is a powerful weapon: Onee you let it out of the bag with insidious \nrumors, YOUf opponents are in a horrible dilemma. On the one hand they \nean deny the rumors, even prove that you have slandered them. But a \nlayer of suspieion will remain: Why are they defending themselves so des­\nperately? Maybe the rumor has some truth to it? If, on the other hand, they \ntake the high road and ignore you, the doubts, unrefuted, will be even \nstronger. If done eorreetly, the sowing of rumors ean so infuriate and unset­\ntle YOUf rivals that in defending themselve s they will make numerous mis­\ntakes. This is the perfeet weapon for those who have no reputation of their \nown to work from. \nOnee Barnum did have a reputation of his own, he used the seeond, \ngentler taetie, the fake hypnotism demonstration: He ridieuled his rivals' \nreputatio n. This too was extremely sueeessful. Onee you have a solid base \nof respeet, ridieuling YOUf opponent both puts hirn on the defensive and \ndraws more attention to you, enhancing your own reputation. Outright \nslander and insult are too strong at this point; they are ugly, and may hurt \nyou more than help you. But gentle barbs and moekery suggest that you \nhave a strong enough sense of your own worth to enjoy a good laugh at \nyour rival's expense. A humorous front ean make you out as a harmless en­\ntertainer while poking holes in the reputation of YOUf rival. \nIt is easier to cope with a bad conscience than with a bad reputation. \nFriedrich Nietzsehe, 1844-1900 \nKEYS TO PO WE R \nThe people around us, even OUf dosest friends, will always to some extent \nremain mysterious and unfathomable. Their eharaeters have seeret reeesses \nthat they never reveal. The unknowabl eness of other people eould prove \ndisturbing if we thought about it long enough, sinee it would make it im­\npossible for us really to judge other people. So we prefer to ignore this fact, \nand to judge people on their appearanees, on what is most visible to OUf \neyes-clot hes, gestures, words, aetions. In the social realm, appearanees are \nthe barometer of almost all of OUf judgments, and you must never be mis­\nled into believing otherwise. One false slip, one awkward or sudden change \nin YOUf appearanee, ean prove disastrous. \nThis is the reason for the supreme importan ce of making and main­\ntaining areputation that is of your own creation. \nThat reputation will protect you in the dangerous game of appear­\nances, distracting the probing eyes of others from knowing what you are \nreally like, and giving you a degree of control over how the world judges \nyou-a powerful position to be in. Reputation has apower like magic: \nWith one stroke of its wand, it can double your strength. It can also send \npeople scurrying away from you. Whether the exact same deeds appear \nbrilliant or dreadful can depend entirely on the reputation of the doer. \nIn the aneient Chinese court of the Wei kingdom there was a man \nnamed Mi Tzu-hsia who had areputation for supreme eivility and graeious­\nness. He became the mler's favorite. It was a law in Wei that \"whoever \nrides secretly in the mler's coach shall have his feet cut off,\" but when Mi \nTzu-hsia's mother fell ill, he used the royal coach to visit her, pretending \nthat the mler had given hirn permission. When the mler found out, he said, \n\"How dutiful is Mi Tzu-hsia! For his mother's sake he even forgot that he \nwas committing a crime making hirn liable to lose his feet!\" \nAnother time the two of them took a stroll in an orchard. Mi Tzu-hsia \nbegan eating a peach that he could not finish, and he gave the mler the \nother half to eat. The mler remarked, \"You love me so much that you would \neven forget your own saliva taste and let me eat the rest of the peach!\" \nLater, however, envious fellow courtiers, spreading word that Mi Tzu­\nhsia was actually devious and arrogant, succeeded in damaging his reputa­\ntion; the mler came to see his actions in a new light. \"This fellow once rode \nin my coach under pretense of my order,\" he told the courtiers angrily, \n\"and another time he gave me a half-eaten peach.\" For the same actions \nthat had charmed the mler when he was the favorite, Mi Tzu-hsia now had \nto suffer the penalties. The fate of his feet depended solelyon the strength \nof his reputation. \nIn the beginning, you must work to establish areputation for one out­\nstanding quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning. This quality \nsets you apart and gets other people to talk ab out you. You then make your \nreputation known to as many people as possible (subtly, though; take care \nto build slowly, and with a firm foundation), and watch as it spreads like \nwildfire. \nA solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your \nstrengths without your having to spend much energy. It can also create an \naura around you that will instill respect, even fear. In the fighting in the \nNorth Af rican desert during World War II, the German general Erwin \nRommel had areputation for cunning and for deceptive maneuvering that \nstruck terror into everyone who faced hirn. Even when his forces were de­\npleted, and when British tanks outnumbered his by five to one, entire eities \nwould be evacuated at the news of his approach. \nAs they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you, and if it inspires \nrespect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive on the scene, \nor utter a single word. \nYour success seems destined by your past triumphs. Much of the suc-\nLAW 5 41 \n42 LAW 5 cess of Henry Kissinger' s shuttle diplomacy rested on bis reputation for \nironing out differences; no one wanted to be seen as so unreasonable that \nKissinger could not sway hirn. A peace treaty seemed a fait accompli as \nsoon as Kissinger's name became involved in the negotia tions. \nMake your reputation simple and base it on one sterling quality. This \nsingle quality--e fficiency, say, or seductiveness- becomes a kind of calling \ncard that announces your presence and places others under aspeIl. A repu­\ntation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of deception. \nCasanova used bis reputation as a great seducer to pave the way for his fu­\nture conquests; women who had heard of his powers became immensely \ncurious, and wanted to discover for themselve s what had made hirn so ro­\nmantically successful. \nPerhaps you have already stained your reputation, so that you are pre­\nvented from establishing a new one. In such cases it is wise to associate \nwith someone whose image counteracts your own, using their good name \nto whitewash and elevate yours. It is hard, for example, to erase a reputa­\ntion for dishonesty by yourself; but a paragon of honesty can help. When \nP. T. Barnum wanted to dean up areputation for promoting vulgar enter­\ntainment, he brought the singer Jenny Lind over from Europe. She had a \nstellar, high-dass reputation, and the American tour Bamum sponsored for \nher greatly enhanced his own image. Similarly the great robber barons of \nnineteenth-c entury America were long unable to rid themselves of a repu­\ntation for cruelty and mean-spirite dness. Only when they began collecting \nart, so that the names of Morgan and Frick became permanently associated \nwith those of da Vinci and Rembrandt, were they able to soften their un­\npleasant image. \nReputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded. Espe­\ncially when you are first establishing it, you must protect it strictly, antici­\npating all attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or \ndefensive at the slanderous comments of your enemies- that reveals inse­\ncurity, not confidence in your reputation. Take the high road instead, and \nnever appear desperate in your self-defense. On the other hand, an attack \non another man's reputation is a potent weapon, particularly when you \nhave less power than he does. He has much more to lose in such a battle, \nand your own thus-far-small reputation gives hirn a small target when he \ntries to return your fire. Bamum used such campaigns to great effect in his \nearly career. But this tactic must be practiced with skill; you must not seem \nto engage in petty vengeance. If you do not break your enemy's reputation \ndeverly, you will ina"

When the Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla appeared to have suc­\nceeded in creating a system based on alternating current (AC), Edison was \nfurious. He determined to ruin Tesla's reputation, by making the public be­\nlieve that the AC system was inherently unsafe, and Tesla irresponsible in \npromoting it. \nTo this end he captured all kinds of household pets and electrocuted \nthem to death with an AC current. When this wasn't enough, in 1890 he got \nNew York State prison auth orities to organize the world's first execution by \nelectrocuti on, using an AC current. Eut Edison's electrocution experiments \nhad all been with small creat ures; the charge was too weak, and the man \nwas only half killed. In perhaps the country's cruelest stat e-authoriz ed exe­\ncution, the procedure had to be repeated. It was an awful specta cle. \nAlthough, in the long run, it is Edison's name that has survived, at the \ntime his campaign damaged his own reputati on more than Tesla's. He \nbacked off. The lesson is simple-never go too far in attacks like these, for \nthat will draw more attention to your own vengefulness than to the person \nyou are slandering. When your own reputation is solid, use subtIer tact ics, \nsuch as satire and ridi cule, to weaken YOUf opponent while making you out \nas a charming rogue.

Perhap s, not caring what others think of you, you gain a \nreputati on for insolence and arro gance, but that can be a valuable image in \nitself -Oscar Wilde used it to great advanta ge. Since we must live in soci­\nety and must depend on the opinions of others, there is nothing to be \ngained by neglecting your reputa tion.

Barnum, America' s premier nineteenth-century showman, started his \ncare er as an assistant to the owner of a circus, Aaron Turner. In 1836 the \ncircus stopped in Annapolis, Maryland, for aseries of performances. On \nthe morning of opening day, Bamum took a stroll through town, wearing a \nnew black suit. People started to follow hirn. Someone in the gathering \ncrowd shouted out that he was the Reverend Ephraim K. Avery, infam ous \nas a man acquitted of the charge of murder but still believed guilty by most \nAmerica ns. The angry mob tore off Barnum's suit and was ready to lynch \nhirn . After desperate app eals, Barnum finally convinced them to follow \nhirn to the circus, where he could verify his ident ity. \nOnce there, old Turner confirmed that this was all a practical joke-he \nhirnself had spread the rumor that Barnum was Avery. The crowd dis­\npersed, but Barnum, who had nearly been killed, was not amused. He \nwanted to know what could have induced his boss to play such a trick. \"My \ndear Mr. Barnum,\" Turner replied, \"it was all for our good. Remember, all \nwe need to ensure success is notori ety. \" And indeed everyone in town was \ntalking about the joke, and the circus was packed that night and every night \nit stayed in Anna polis. Barnum had learned a lesson he would never forget. \nBarnum's first big venture of his own was the American Museum-a \ncollection of curiosit ies, located in New York. One day a beggar ap­\nproached Barnum in the street. Instead of giving hirn money, Barnum de­\ncided to employ hirn. Taking hirn back to the museum, he gave the man \nfive bricks and told hirn to make a slow circuit of several blocks. At certain \npoints he was to lay down a brick on the sidewalk, always keeping one \nbrick in hand. On the return journey he was to replace each brick on the \nstreet with the one he held. Meanwhile he was to remain serious of counte­\nnance and to answer no quest ions. Once back at the museum, he was to \nenter, walk around inside, then leave through the back door and make the \nsame bricklaying circuit aga in. \nOn the man's first walk through the streets, several hundred people \nwatch ed his mysterious movements. By his fourth circuit, onlookers \nswa rmed around hirn, debating what he was doing. Every time he entered \nthe museum he was followed by people who bought tickets to keep watch­\ning hirn. Many of them were distracted by the museum's collections, and \nstayed inside. By the end of the first day, the brick man had drawn over a THE WASP y'm TIW \nPHI\\ CE \nA wasp named Pin TaU \nwas long in quest of \nsome deed that would \nmake hirn forever \nfamous. So one day he \nentered the king's \npalace and stung the \nlittle prince, who was in \nbed. The prince awoke \nwith loud cries. The \nking and his courtiers \nrushed in to see what \nhad happened. The \nprince was yelling as \nthe wasp stung hirn \nagain and again. The \ncourtiers tried to catch \nthe wasp, and each in \nturn was stung. The \nwhole royal household \nrushed in, the news \nso on spread, and \npeople flocked to the \npalace. The city was in \nan uproar, all business \nsuspended. Said the \nwasp to itself, before it \nexpired from its efforts, \n\"A name without farne \nis like fire without \nflame.

But Barnum took pains to hire the worst musicians he could find, \nand soon after the band struck up, people would hurry to buy tickets to the \nmuseum, where they would be out of earshot of the band's noise, and of \nthe booing of the crowd. \nOne of the first oddities Barnum toured around the country was Joice \nHeth, a woman he claimed was 161 years old, and whom he advertised as a \nslave who had once been George Washing ton's nurse. After several \nmonths the crowds began to dwin dle, so Barnum sent an anonymous letter \nto the papers, claiming that Heth was a clever fraud. joice Heth,\" he \nwrote, \"is not a human being but an automaton, made up of whalebone, \nindia-rub ber, and numb erless sprin gs.\" Those who had not bothered to see \nher before were immediately curious, and those who had already seen her \npaid to see her again, to find out whether the rumor that she was a robot \nwas true. \nIn 1842, Barnum purchas ed the carcass of what was purported to be a \nmermaid. This crea ture resembled a monkey with the body of a fish, but \nthe head and body were perfectly joined -it was truly a wonder. After \nsome research Barnum discovered that the creature had been expertly put \ntogether in Japan, where the hoax had caused quite a stir. \nHe nevert heless planted articles in newspapers around the country \nclaiming the capture of a mermaid in the Fiji Islands. He also sent the pa­\npers woodcut prints of paintings showing mermaids. By the time he showed \nthe specimen in his museum, anational debate had been sparked over the \nexistence of these mythical creature s. A few months before Barnum's cam­\npaign, no one had cared or even known about mermaidsj now everyone \nwas talking about them as if they were real. Crowds flocked in record num­\nbers to see the Fiji Mermaid, and to hear debates on the subject. \nA few years later, Barnum toured Europe with General Tom Thumb, a \nfive-year-old dwarf from Connecticut whom Barnum claimed was an \neleven-year-old English boy, and whom he had trained to do many re­\nmarkable acts. During this tour Barnum's name attracted such attenti on \nthat Queen Victoria, that paragon of sobriety, requested a private audience \nwith hirn and his talented dwarf at Buckingham Palac e. The English press \nmay have ridiculed Bamum, but Victoria was royally entertained by hirn, \nand respected hirn ever after. \nInterpretation \nBarnum understood the fundamental truth about attracting attention: \nOnce people's eyes are on you, you have a special legitimacy. For Barnum, \ncreating interest meant creating a crowd ; as he later wrote, \"Every crowd \nhas a silver lining. \" And crowds tend to act in con junction. If one person \nstops to see your beggarman laying bricks in the street, more will do the \nsarne. They will gather like dust bunn ies. Then, given a gentle push, they \nwill enter your museum or watch your show. To create a crowd you have to \ndo something diff erent and odd. Any kind of curiosity will serve the pur­\npose, for crowds are magnetically attracted by the unusual and inexplica­\nble. And once you have their attention, never let it go. If it veers toward \nother people, it does so at your expense. Barn um would ruthlessly suck at­\ntention from his competitors, knowing what a valuable commodity it iso \nAt the beginning of your rise to the top, then, spend all your energy on \nattracting attention. Most importa nt: The quality of the attention is irrele­\nvant. No matter how badly his shows were reviewed, or how slanderously \npersonal were the attacks on his hoaxes, Barnum would never complain. If \na newspa per critic reviled hirn particularly badly, in fact, he made sure to \ninvite the man to an opening and to give hirn the best seat in the house. He \nwould even write anonymous attacks on his own work, just to keep his \nname in the papers . From Barnum's vantage, attention-wh ether negative \nor positive-was the main ingredient of his success. The worst fate in the \nworld for a man who yearns farn e, glory, and, of course, power is to be \nignor ed. \nIf the courtier happens to engage in arms in some public spectacle \nsuch as jousting ... he will ensure that the horse he has is beautifully \ncaparisoned, that he himself is suitably attired, with appropriate \nmottoes and ingenious devices to attract the eyes 0/ the onlookers \nin his direction as surely as the lodestone attracts iron. \nRaidassar e Castiglione, 1478-1529 \nKEYS TO PO WER \nBurning more brightly than those around you is a skill that no one is born \nwith. You have to team to attract attention, \"as surely as the lodestone at­\ntracts iron .\" At the start of your career, you must attach your narne and rep­\nutati on to a quality, an image, that sets you apart from other people. This \nimage can be somet hing like a chara cteristic style of dress, or a perso nality \nquirk that amu ses people and gets talked about. Once the image is estab­\nlished, you have an appeara nce, a place in the sky for your star. \nIt is a common mistake to imagine that this peculiar appearance of \nyours should not be controversial, that to be attack ed is somehow bad. \nNothing could be further from the truth. To avoid being a flash in the pan, \nand having your notoriety eclipsed by another, you must not discriminate \nbetween different types of atten tion; in the end, every kind will work in \nyour favor.

The duke was short, almost \ndwarfish, and he was prone to the most insolent kinds of beha vior-he \nslept with the kin g's mistre ss, and openly insulted not only other courtiers \nbut the king hirnself. Louis, however, was so beguiled by the duke 's eccen­\ntricities that he could not bear his absences from the court. It was sim ple: \nThe strange ness of the duke's character attracted attenti on. Once people \nwere enthralled by hirn, they wanted hirn around at any cost. \nSociety craves larger-than-life figures, people who stand above the \ngeneral medio crity. Never be afraid, then, of the qualiti es that set you apart \nand draw attenti on to you. Court controversy, even scandal . It is better to \nbe attacked, even slandered, than ignored. All professions are ruled by this \nlaw, and all professionals must have a bit of the showman about them. \nThe great scientist Thomas Edison knew that to raise money he had to \nremain in the public eye at any cost. Almost as important as the inventions \nthemselves was how he presented them to the public and courted attention. \nEdison would design visually dazzling experiments to display his dis­\ncoveries with elect ricity. He would talk of future inventions that seemed \nfantastic at the time- robots, and machines that could photograph \nthought-and that he had no intention of wasting his energy on, but that \nmade the public talk about hirn. He did everything he could to make sure \nthat he received more attention than his great riyal Nikola Tesla, who may \nactually have been more brilliant than he was but whose name was far less \nknown. In 1915, it was rumored that Edison and Tesla would be joint recip­\nients of that year's Nobel Prize in phys ics. The prize was eventually given to \na pair of English physicists ; only later was it discovered that the prize com­\nmittee had actually approached Edison, but he had tumed them down, re­\nfusing to share the prize with Tesla. By that time his fame was more seeure \nthan Tesla's, and he thought it better to refuse the honor than to allow his \nriyal the attention that would have come even from sharing the prize. \nIf you find yourself in a lowly position that offers little opportunity for \nyou to draw attention, an effective trick is to attack the most visible, most \nfamous, most powerful person you can find.

Never make it too clear what you are \ndoing or about to do. Do not show all your cards. An air of mystery height­\nens your presence; it also creates anticipation-every one will be watching \nyou to see what happens next. Use mystery to beguile, seduce, even frighten. \nOBSER VA NCE OF THE LAW \nBeginning in 1905, rumors started to spread throughout Paris of a young \nOriental girl who danced in a private horne, wrapp ed in veils that she grad­\nually discarded. A local journalist who had seen her dancing reported that \n\"a woman from the Far East had come to Europe laden with perfume and \njewels, to introduce some of the richness of the Oriental colour and life into \nthe satiated society of European cities.\" Soon everyone knew the dancer's \nname : Mata Hari. \nEarly that year, in the winter, small and select audiences would gather \nin a salon filled with Indian statu es and other relics while an orchestra \nplayed music inspired by Hindu andJava nese melodies. Mter keeping the \naudie nce waiting and wondering, Mata Hari would suddenly appear, in a \nstartling costume : a white cotton brassiere coyered with Indian-type jewels; \njeweled bands at the waist supporting a sarong that revealed as much as it \nconcealed; bracelets up the arms. Then Mata Hari would dance, in a style \nno one in Fran ce had seen before, her whole body swaying as if she were in \na tranc e. She told her excited and curious audience that her dances told \nstories from Indian mythology and Java nese folktales. Soon the cream of \nParis, and ambassadors from far-off lands, were competing for invitations \nto the salon, where it was rumored that Mata Hari was actually performing \nsacred dances in the nude. \nThe public wanted to know more about her. She told journalists that \nshe was actually Dutch in origin, but had grown up on the island of Java. \nShe would also talk about time spent in India, how she had leamed sacred \nHindu dances there, and how Indian women \"can shoot straight, ride \nhorseback, and are capable of doing logarithms and talk philosophy.\" By \nthe summer of 1905, although few Parisians had actually seen Mata Hari \ndance, her name was on everyone's lips. \nAs Mata Hari gave more inter views, the story of her origins kept \nchang ing: She had grown up in India, her grandmother was the daughter \nof a Java nese princess, she had lived on the island of Sumatra where she \nhad spent her time \"horseback riding, gun in hand, and risking her life.\" \nNo one knew anything certain about her, but journalists did not mind these \nchanges in her biography. They compared her to an Indian goddess, a \ncreature from the pages of Baudelair e--whatever their imagination wanted \nto see in this mysterious woman from the East. \nIn August of 1905, Mata Hari performed for the first time in public. \nrCrowds thronging to see her on opening night caused a riot. She had now \nbecome a cult figure, spawning many imita tions. One reviewer wrote, \n\"Mata Hari personifies all the poetry of India, its mysticism, its voluptuous­\nness, its hypnotizing charm.\" Another noted, \"If India possesses such unex­\npected treasure s, then all Frenchmen will emigrate to the shores of the \nGange s.\" \nSoon the fame of Mata Hari and her sacred Indian da nces spread be­\nyond Paris. She was invited to Berlin, Vienna, Milan. Over the next few \nyears she performed throughout Europ e, mixed with the high est social cir­\neIes, and eamed an income that gave her an independence rarely enjoyed \nby a woman of the period. Then, near the end of Wo rld War I, she was ar­\nrested in France, tried, convicted, and finally executed as a German spy. \nOnly during the trial did the truth come out: Mata Hari was not from Java \nor India, had not grown up in the Orient, did not have a drop of Eastem \nblood in her bod y. Her real name was Margaretha Zelle, and she came \nfrom the stolid northem province of Friesland, Holland. \nInterpretation \nWhen Marga retha Zelle arrived in Paris, in 1904, she had half a franc in \nher pocket. She was one of the thousands of beautiful young girls who \nflocked to Paris every year, taking work as artists' models, nightclub \ndanc ers, or vaudevil le performers at the Folies Berge re. Mter a few years \nthey would inevitably be replaced by younger girls, and would often end \nup on the streets, tuming to prostitution, or else retuming to the town they \ncame from, older and chaste ned. \nZelle had higher ambitions. She had no dance experience and had \nnever performed in the theater, but as a young girl she had trave led with \nher family and had witnessed local dances in Java and Sumatra. Zelle \neIearly understood that what was important in her act was not the dance it­\nself, or even her face or figure, but her ability to create an air of mystery \nabout herself. The mystery she created lay not just in her dancing, or her \ncostum es, or the stories she would tell, or her endless lies about her origin s; \nit lay in an atmosphere enveloping everything she did. There was nothing \nyou could say for sure about her-she was always changing, always sur­\nprising her audience with new costumes, new dances, new stories. This air \nof mystery left the public always wanting to know more, always wondering \nabout her next move. Mata Hari was no more beautiful than many of the \nother young girls who came to Paris, and she was not a particularly good \ndancer. What separated her from the mass, what attracted and held the \npublic' s attention and made her famous and wealthy, was her mystery. \nPeop le are enthralled by mystery; because it invites constant interpreta­\ntion, they never tire of it. The mysterious cannot be grasp ed. And what \ncannot be seized and consumed creates power. \nLAW 6 51 \n52 LAW 6 KEYS TO POWER \nIn the past, the world was filled with the terrifying and unknowable­\ndiseases, disasters, capricious despots, the mystery of death itself. What we \ncould not understand we reimagined as myths and spirits. Over the cen­\nturies, though, we have manage d, through science and reason, to illumi­\nnate the dark ness; what was mysterious and forbidding has grown familiar \nand comfortable. Yet this light has a price: in a world that is ever more \nbanal, that has had its mystery and myth squeezed out of it, we secretly \ncrave enigmas, people or things that cannot be instantly interpreted, \ns"

Mystery that is woven into your day-to-day demeanor, \nand is subtle, has that much more power to fascinate and attract attention. \nRemember: Most people are upfront, can be read like an open book, take \nlittle care to control their words or image, and are hopelessly predicta ble. \nBy simply holding back, keeping silent, occasionally uttering ambiguous \nphrases, deliberately appearing inconsistent, and acting odd in the subtlest \nof ways, you will emanate an aura of mystery. The people around you will \nthen magnify that aura by constantly trying to interpret you. \nBoth artists and con artists understand the vital link between being \nmysterious and attracting interest. Count Victor Lustig, the aristocrat of \nswindlers, played the game to perfection. He was always doing things that \nwere different, or seemed to make no sense. He would show up at the best \nhotels in a limo driven by a Japanese chauffeur; no one had ever seen a \nJapanese chauffeur before, so this seemed exotic and strange. Lustig would \ndress in the most expensive clothing, but always with something-a medal, \na flower, an armband-out of place, at least in conventional terms. This \nwas seen not as tasteless but as odd and intriguing. In hotels he would be \nseen receiving telegrams at all hours, one after the other, brought to hirn by \nhis Japanese chauffeur-te legrams he would tear up with utter noncha­\nlance. (In fact they were fakes, completely blank.) He would sit alone in the \ndining room, reading a large and impressive-Iooking book, smiling at peo­\npIe yet remaining aloof. Within a few days, of course, the entire hotel \nwould be abuzz with interest in this strange man. \nAll this attention allowed Lustig to lure suckers in with ease. They \nwould beg for his confidence and his compa ny. Everyone wanted to be \nseen with this mysterious aristocrat. And in the presence of this distracting \nenigma, they wouldn't even notice that they were being robbed blind. \nAn air of mystery can make the mediocre appear intelligent and pro­\nfound. It made Mata Hari, a woman of average appearance and intelli­\ngence, seem like a goddess, and her dancing divinely inspired. An air of \nmystery about an artist makes his or her artwork immediately more intrigu­\ning, a trick Marcel Duchamp played to great effect. It is all very easy to \ndo-say little about your work, tease and titillate with alluring, even contra­\ndictory comments, then stand back and let others try to make sense of it all. \nMysterious people put others in a kind of inferior position-that of try­\ning to figure them out. To degrees that they can control, they also elicit the \nfear surrounding anything uncertain or unknown. All great leaders know \nthat an aura of mystery draws attention to them and creates an intimidating \npresence. Mao Tse-tung, for example, cleverly cultivated an enigmatic \nimage; he had no worries about seeming inconsistent or contradicting him­\nself-the very contradictoriness of his actions and words meant that he al­\nways had the upper hand. No one, not even his own wife, ever feIt they \nunderstood hirn, and he therefore seemed larger than life. This also meant \nthat the public paid constant attention to hirn, ever anxious to witness his \nnextmove. \nIf your social position prevents you from completely wrapping your \nactions in mystery, you must at least learn to make yourself less obvious. \nEvery now and then, act in a way that does not mesh with other people's \nperception of you. This way you keep those around you on the defensive, \neliciting the kind of attention that makes you powerful . Done right, the cre­\nation of enigma can also draw the kind of attention that strikes terror into \nyour enemy. \nDuring the Second Punic War (219-202 B.C.), the great Carthaginian \ngeneral Hannibal was wreaking havoc in his march on Rome. Hannibal \nwas known for his cleverness and duplicity. \nUnder his leadership Carthage 's army, though smaller than those of \nthe Romans, had constantly outmaneuvered them. On one occasion, \nthough, Hanniba l's scouts made a horrible blunder, leading his troops into \na marshy terrain with the sea at their back. The Roman army blocked the \nmountain passes that led inland, and its general, Fabius, was ecstatic-at \nlast he had Hannibal trapped. Posting his best sentries on the passes, he \nworked on a plan to destroy Hanniba l's forces. But in the middle of the \nnight, the sentries looked down to see a mysterious sight: A huge pro ces­\nsion of lights was heading up the mountain. Thousands and thousands of \nlights. If this was Hannibal's army, it had suddenly grown a hundredf old. \nThe sentries argued heatedly about what this could mean: Reinforce­\nments from the sea? Troops that had been hidden in the area? Ghosts ? No \nexplana tion made sense. \nAs they watched, fires broke out all over the mountain, and a horrible \nnoise drifted up to them from below, like the blowing of a million horns. \nDemons, they thought. The sentries, the bravest and most sensible in the \nRoman army, fled their posts in a panic. \nBy the next day, Hannibal had escaped from the marshla nd. What was \nhis trick? Had he really cOI�ured up demons? Actually what he had done \nwas order bundles of twigs to be fastened to the horns of the thousands of \noxen that traveled with his troops as beasts of burden. The twigs were then \nLAW 6 53 \n54 , LAW 6 lit, giving the impression of the torches of a vast army heading up the \nmountain. When the flarnes burned down to the oxen's skin, they stam­\npeded in all directions, bellowing like mad and setting fires all over the \nmountain side. The key to this device's success was not the torches, the \nfires, or the noises in themselves, however, but the fact that Hannibal had \ncreated a puzzle that captivate d the sentries' attention and gradually terri­\nfied them. From the mountaintop there was no way to explain this bizarre \nsight. If the sentries could have explain ed it they would have stayed at their \nposts. \nIf you find yourself trapped, cornered, and on the defensive in some \nsituation, try a simple experiment: Do somet hing that cannot be easily ex­\nplained or interpreted. Choose a simple action, but carry it out in a way \nthat unsettles your opponent, a way with many possible interpreta tions, \nmaking your intentions obscure. Don't just be unpredictable (although this \ntactic too can be successful-see Law 17); like Hannibal, create a scene that \ncannot be read. There will seem to be no method to your madness, no \nrhyme or reason, no single explanation. If you do this right, you will in­\nspire fear and trembling and the sentries will abandon their posts. Call it \nthe \"feigned madness of Harnlet\" tactic, for Harnlet uses it to great effect in \nShakespeare's play, frightening his stepfather Claudius through the mys­\ntery of his behavior. The mysterious makes your forces seem larger, your \npower more terrifying. \nImage: The Dance of \nthe Veils-the veils \nenvelop the dancer. \nWhat they re veal \ncauses excitement. \nWhat they conceal \nheightens interest. The \nessence of mystery. \nAuthority: If you do not declare yourself immediately, you arouse \nexpectation .... Mix a litde mystery with everything, and the very \nmystery stirs up veneration. And when you explain, be not too ex­\nplicit. . . . In this manner you imitate the Divine way when you \ncause men to wonder and watch. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658) \nREVERSAL \nIn the beginning of your rise to the top, you must attraet attention at all \ncost, but as you rise higher you must constantly adapt. Never wear the pub­\nlic out with the same tactic. An air of mystery works wonders for those who \nneed to develop an aura of power and get themselves noticed, but it must \nseem measured and under control. Mata Hari went too far with her fabri­\ncations; although the accusation that she was a spy was false, at the time it \nwas a reasonable presumption because all her lies made her seem suspi­\ncious and nefarious. Do not let your air of mystery be slowly transformed \ninto areputation for deceit. The mystery you create must s"

Recognize when it goes too far, and puH back. \nThere are times when the need for attention must be deferred, and \nwhen scandal and notoriety are the last things you want to create. The at­\ntention you attraet must never offend or challenge the reputation of those \nabove you-not, at any rate, if they are secure. You will seem not only pal­\ntry but desperate by compari son. There is an art to knowing when to draw \nnotice and when to withdraw. \nLola Montez was one of the great practit ioners of the art of attracting \nattention. She managed to rise from a middle-class lrish background to \nbeing the lover of Franz Liszt and then the mistress and political adviser of \nKing Ludwig of Bavaria. In her later years, though, she lost her sense of \nproport ion. \nIn London in 1850 there was to be a performa nce of Shakespeare's \nMacbeth featuring the greatest actor of the time, Charles John Kean. Every­\none of consequence in English society was to be there; it was rumored that \neven Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were to make a public appearance. \nThe custom of the period demanded that everyone be seated before the \nqueen arrived. So the audience got there a little early, and when the queen \nentered her royal box, they observed the convention of standing up and \napplauding her. The royal couple waited, then bowed. Everyone sat down \nand the lights were dimmed. Then, suddenly, all eyes turned to a box op­\nposite Queen Victoria' s: A woman appeared from the shadows, taking her \nseat later than the queen. It was Lola Montez. She wore a diamond tiara on \nher dark hair and a long fur coat over her shoulders. People whispered in \namazement as the ermine cloak was dropped to reveal a low-necked gown \nof crimson velvet. By turning their heads, the audience could see that the \nroyal couple deliberately avoided looking at Lola's box. They foHowed \nVictoria's example, and for the rest of the evening Lola Montez was ig­\nnored. Mter that evening no one in fashionable society dared to be seen \nwith her. All her magnetic powers were rever sed. People would flee her \nsight. Her future in England was fini shed. \nNever appear overly greedy for attention, then, for it signals insecurity, \nand insecurity drives power away. Understand that there are times when it \nis not in your interest to be the center of attention. When in the presence of \na king or queen, for instance, or the equivalent thereof, bow and retreat to \nthe shadows; never compete. \nLAW 6 55 \n56 LAW \n7 \nGET OTHERS TO DO THE \nWORK FO R YOU, BUT \nAL WAY S TA KE THE CREDIT \nJUDGMENT \nUse the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people \nto further your own cause. Not only will such assistance \nsave you valuable time and energy, it will give you a \ngodlike aura of efficiency and speed. In the end your \nhelpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. \nNever do yourself what others can do for you. \nTRANSGRESSION AND OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW \nIn 1883 a young Serbian scientist named Nikola Tesla was working for the \nEuropean division of the Continental Edison Company. He was a brilliant \ninventor, and Charles Batchelor, a plant manager and a personal friend of \nThomas Edison, persuaded him he should seek his fortune in America, giv­\ning hirn a letter of introduction to Edison hirnself. So began a life of woe \nand tribulation that lasted until Tesla's death. \nWhen Tesla met Edison in New York, the famous inventor hired him \non the spot. Tesla worked eighteen-hour days, finding ways to improve the \nprimitive Edison dynamo s. Finally he offered to redesign them completely. \nTo Edison this seemed a monumental task that could last years without \npaying off, but he told Tesla, \"There's fifty thousand dollars in it for you-if \nyou can do it.\" Tesla labored day and night on the project and after only a \nyear he produced a greatly improved version of the dynamo, complete \nwith automatie controls. He went to Edison to break the good news and re­\nceive his $50,000. Edison was pleased with the improvement, for which he \nand his company would take credit, but when it came to the issue of the \nmoney he told the young Serb, \"Tesla, you don't understand our American \nhumor!,\" and offered a small raise instead. \nTesla's obsession was to create an altemating-current system (AC) of \nelectricity. Edison believed in the direct-current system (DC), and not only \nrefused to support Tesla's research but later did all he could to sabotage \nhim. Tesla tumed to the great Pittsburgh magnate George Westinghouse, \nwho had started his own electricity company. Westinghouse completely \nfunded Tesla's research and offered hirn a generous royalty agreement on \nfuture profits. The AC system Tesla developed is still the standard today­\nbut after patents were filed in his name, other scientists came forward to \ntake credit for the invention, claiming that they had laid the groundwork \nfor hirn. His name was lost in the shuffle, and the public came to associate \nthe invention with Westinghouse hirnself. \nA year later, Westinghouse was caught in a takeover bid from \nJ. Pierpont Morgan, who made hirn rescind the generous royalty contract \nhe had signed with Tesla. Westinghouse explained to the scientist that his \ncompany would not survive if it had to pay hirn his full royalties; he per­\nsuaded Tesla to accept a buyout of his patents for $216,000-a large sum, \nno doubt, but far less than the $12 million they were worth at the time. The \nfinanciers had divested Tesla of the riches, the paten ts, and essentially the \ncredit for the greatest invention of his career. \nThe name of Guglielmo Marconi is forever linked with the invention \nof radio. But few know that in producing his invention-he broadcast a sig­\nnal across the English Channel in 1899-Marconi made use of a patent \nTesla had filed in 1897, and that his work depended on Tesla's research. \nOnce again Tesla received no money and no credit. Tesla invented an in­\nduction motor as well as the AC power system, and he is the real \"father of \nradio.\" Yet none of these discoveries bear his name. As an old man, he \nlived in poverty. THE TORTOISE. THE \nELEPIIA \\iT. A\"'D TIIE \nHIPPO POTA \\1I S \nOne day the tortoise \nmet the elephant, who \ntrumpeted, \"Out of my \nway, you weakling-\nI might step on you!\" \nThe tortoise was not \nafraid and stayed \nwhere he was, so the \nelephant stepped on \nhim, but could not \ncrush him. \"Da not \nboast, Mr. Elephant, I \nam as strang as you \nare!\" said the tortoise, \nbut the elephant just \nlaughed. So the tortoise \nasked him to come \nto his hill the next \nmorning. \nThe next day, before \nsunrise, the tortoise ran \ndown the hili to the \nriver, where he met the \nhippopotamus, who \nwas just on his way \nback into the water \nafter his nocturnal \nfeeding. \"Mr Hippo! \nShall we have a tug·ol­\nwar? I bet I'm as \nstrang as you are!\" \nsaid the tortoise. The \nhippopotamus laughed \nat this ridiculous idea, \nbut agreed. The tortoise \nproduced a lang rope \nand told the hippo to \nhold it in his mouth \nuntil the tortoise \nshouted \"Hey!\" \nThen the tortoise ran \nback up the hili where \nhe found the elephant, \nwho was getting impa· \ntient. He gave the \nelephant the other end \nofthe rope and said, \n\"When I say 'Hey!' \npull, and you '11 see \nwhich of us is the \nstrongest.\" Then he ran \nhalfway back down the \nLAW 7 57 \nhili, 10 a place where he \n('ouldn 'I he seen, ami \nShO/lled, \"Hey!\" The \nelephant and Ihe \nhippopotamus pulled \nand pulled, hul neirher \n{'()/lId hudge Ihe \nolher�lhey were oI \neq/lal strengllz.

      "chapter_text": "g his later impoverished years, Tesla was told he was to \nreceive the Edison Medal of the American Institute of Electrical Eng ineers. \nHe tumed the medal down. \"You propose, \" he said, \"to honor me with a \nmedal which I could pin upon my coat and strut for a vain hOUf before the \nmembers of your Institu te. You would decorate my body and continue to \nlet starve, for failure to supply recognition, my mind and its creative prod­\nucts, which have supplied the foundation upon which the major portion of \nyour Institute exists .\" \nInterpretation \nMany harb or the illusion that science, dealing with facts as it does, is be­\nyond the petty rivalries that trouble the rest of the world. Nikola Tesla was \none of those. He believed science had nothing to do with politics, and \nclaimed not to care for farne and riches, As he grew older, though, this ru­\nined his scientific work. Not associated with any particular discovery, he \ncould attract no investors to his many ideas. While he pondered great in­\nventions for the future, others stole the patents he had already developed \nand got the glory for themselves. \nHe wanted to do everything on his own, but merely exhausted and im­\npoverished hirnself in the process. \nEdison was Tesla's polar opposite . He wasn't actually much of a scien­\ntific thinker or inventor; he once said that he had no need to be a mathe­\nmatician because he could always hire one. That was Edison's main \nmethod. He was really a businessman and publicist, spotting the trends and \nthe oppor tuniti es that were out there, then hiring the best in the field to do \nthe work for him. If he had to he would steal from his competitors . Yet his \nname is much better known than Tesla's, and is associated with more in­\nventions. \nThe lesson is twof old: First, the credit for an invention or creation is as \nimportant, if not more important, than the invention itself. You must seeUfe \nthe credit for YOUfseif and keep others from stealing it away, or from piggy­\nbacking on YOUf hard work. To accomplish this you must always be vigilant \nand ruthless, keeping YOUf creation quiet until you can be SUfe there are no \nvultures circling overhead. Second, leam to take advantage of other peo­\nple's work to further YOUf own cause. Time is precious and life is short. If \nyou try to do it all on YOUf own, you run yourself ragge d, waste energy, and \nbum yourself out. It is far better to conserve your forces, pounce on the \nwork others have done, and find a way to make it YOUf own. \nEverybody steals in commerce and industry. \nI've stolen a lot myself. \nBut I know how to steal. \nThomas Edison, 18 47 -1931 \nKEYS TO POWER \nThe world of power has the dynamics of the jungle: There are those who \nlive by hunting and killing, and there are also vast numbers of creatures \n(hyenas, vultures) who live off the hunting of others. These latter, less \nimaginative types are often incapable of doing the work that is essential for \nthe creation of power. They understand early on, though, that if they wait \nlong enough, they can always find another animal to do the work for them. \nDo not be naive: At this very moment, while you are slaving away on some \nproject, there are vultures cirding above trying to figure out a way to sur­\nvive and even thrive off your creativity. It is useless to complain about this, \nor to wear yourself ragged with bittemess, as Tesla did. Better to protect \nyourself and join the game. Once you have established a power base, be­\ncome a vulture yourse lf, and save yourself a lot of time and energy. \nOf the two poles of this game, one can be illustrated by the example of \nthe explorer Vasco Nliiiez de Balboa. Balboa had an obsession-the dis­\ncovery of EI Dorado, a legendary city of vast riches. \nEarly in the sixteenth century, after countless hardships and brushes \nwith death, he found evidence of a great and wealthy empire to the south \nof Mexico, in present-day Peru. By conquering this empire, the Incan, and \nseizing its gold, he would make hirnself the next Cortes. The problem was \nthat even as he made this discovery, word of it spread among hundreds of \nother conquistad ors. He did not understand that half the game was keeping \nit quiet, and carefully watching those around hirn. A few years after he dis­\ncovered the location of the Incan empire, a soldier in his own army, Fran­\ncisco Pizarro, helped to get hirn beheaded for treason . Pizarro went on to \ntake what Balboa had spent so many years trying to find. \nThe other pole is that of the artist Peter Paul Rubens, who, late in his \ncareer, found hirnself deluged with requests for paintings . He created a sys­\ntem: In his large studio he employed dozens of outstanding painters, one \nspecializing in robes, another in backgr ounds, and so on. He created a vast \nproduction line in which a large number of canvases would be worked on \nat the same time. When an important dient visited the studio, Rubens \nwould shoo his hired painters out for the day. While the dient watched \nfrom a balcony, Rubens would work at an incredible pace, with unbeliev­\nable energy. The dient would leave in awe of this prodigious man, who \ncould paint so many masterpi eces in so short a time. \nThis is the essence of the Law: Leam to get others to do the work for \nyou while you take the credit, and you appear to be of godlike strength and \npower. If you think it important to do all the work yourself, you will never \nget far, and you will suffer the fate of the Balboas and Teslas of the world. \nFind people with the skills and creativity you lack. Either hire them, while \nputting your own name on top of theirs, or find a way to take their work \nand make it your own. Their creativity thus becomes yours, and you seem \na genius to the world. \nThere is another application of this law that does not require the para­\nsitic use of your contemporaries' labor: Use the past, a vast storehouse of 1111· 111.1 ''') 111\\ \nA hen wllO had !osl her \nsighl, und wo\" a('elf.\\'­\n(ol}u!d f() scratching up \nIhe carlh in sellrch oI \nfl)(!d, 1I1riwI/gh blind, \n.l'Ii!! eol1linlled (() \ns('rurch lIH'llY 111os1 (lili­\ngenl!V.

Isaac Newton called this \"standing on the shoul­\nders of giants.\" He meant that in making his discoveries he had built on the \nachievements of others. A great part of his aura of genius, he knew, was at­\ntributable to his shrewd ability to make the most of the insights of ancient, \nmedieval, and Renaissance scientists. Shakespeare borrowed plots, charac­\nterizations, and even dialogue from Plutarch, among other writers, for he \nknew that nobody surpassed Plutarch in the writing of subtle psychology \nand witty quotes. How many later writers have in their turn borrowed \nfrom-plagiarize d--Shakespeare? \nWe all know how few of today's politicians write their own speeches. \nTheir own words would not win them a single vote ; their eloquence and \nwit, whatever there is of it, they owe to a speech writer. Other people \ndo the work, they take the credit. The upside of this is that it is a kind \nof power that is available to everyone. Leam to use the knowledge of the \npast and you will look like a genius, even when you are really just adever \nborrower. \nWriters who have delved into human nature, ancient masters of strat­\negy, historians of human stupidity and folly, kings and queens who have \nleamed the hard way how to handle the burdens of power-their knowl­\nedge is gathering dust, waiting for you to come and stand on their shoul­\nders. Their wit can be your wit, their skill can be your skill, and they will \nnever come around to tell people how unoriginal you really are.

The city was fuH of gai­\nety and the balls were the most splendid in memory. Hovering over the \nproceedings , however, was the shadow of Napoleon hirnself. Instead of \nbeing executed or exiled far away, he had been sent to the island of Elba, \nnot far from the co ast of Italy. \nEven imprisoned on an island, a man as bold and creative as \nNapoleon Bonaparte made everyone nervous. The Austrians plotted to kill \nhirn on Elba, but decided it was too risky. Alexander I, Russia's tempera­\nmental czar, heightened the anxiety by throwing a fit during the congress \nwhen apart of Poland was denied him: \"Beware, I shall loose the mon­\nster!\" he threatened. Everyone knew he meant Napoleon. Of all the states­\nmen gathered in Vienna, only Talleyrand, Napoleon's former foreign \nminister, seemed calm and unconcerned. It was as if he knew something \nthe others did not. \nMeanwhile, on the island of Elba, Napoleon's life was a mockery of his \nprevious glory. As Elba's \"king,\" he had been allowed to form a court­\nthere was a cook, a wardrobe mistress, an official pianist, and a handful of \ncourtiers. All this was designed to humiliate Napoleon, and it seemed to \nwork. \nThat winter, however, there occurred aseries of events so strange and \ndramatic they might have been scripted in a play. Elba was surrounded by \nBritish ships, their cannons covering all possible exit points. Yet somehow, \nin broad daylight on 26 February 1815, a ship with nine hundred men on \nboard picked up Napoleon and put to sea. The English gave chase but the \nship got away. This almost impossible escape astonished the public \nthroughout Europe, and terrified the statesmen at the Congress of Vienna. \nAlthough it would have been safer to leave Europe, Napoleon not only \nchose to return to France, he raised the odds by marching on Paris with a \ntiny army, in hopes of recapturing the throne. His strategy worked- people \nof all classes threw themselves at his feet. An army under Marshal Ney sped \nfrom Paris to arrest hirn, but when the soldiers saw their beloved former \nleader, they changed sides. Napoleon was declared emperor again. Volun­\nteers swelled the ranks of his new army. Delirium swept the country. In Paris, \ncrowds went wild. The king who had replaced Napoleon fled the country. \nFor the next hundred days, Napoleon ruled France. Soon, however, the \ngiddiness subsided. France was bankrupt, its resources nearly exhausted, \nand there was little Napoleon could do about this. At the Battle ofWaterloo, \nin June of that year, he was finally defeated for good. This time his enemies \nhad learned their lesson: They exiled hirn to the barren island of Saint He­\nlena, off the west coast of Mrica. There he had no more hope of escape. \nInterpretation \nOnly years later did the facts of Napoleon's dramatic escape from Elba \ncome to light. Before he decided to attempt this bold move, visitors to his \ncourt had told hirn that he was more popular in France than ever, and that \nLAW 8 63 \n64 LAW 8 the country would embrace hirn again. One of these visitors was Austria's \nGeneral Koller, who convinced Napoleon that if he escaped, the European \npowers, England included, would welcome him back into power. Napoleon \nwas tipped off that the English would let hirn go, and indeed his escape oc­\ncurred in the middle of the afternoon, in full view of English spyglasses. \nWhat Napoleon did not know was that there was a man behind it all, \npulling the strings, and that this man was his former minister, Talleyran d. \nAnd Talleyrand was doing all this not to bring back the glory days but to \ncrush Napoleon once and for all. Considering the emperor's ambition un­\nsettling to Europe's stability, he had turned against hirn long ago. When \nNapoleon was exiled to Elba, Talleyrand had protested. Napoleon should \nbe sent farther away, he argued, or Europe would never have peace. But \nno one listened. \nInstead of pushing his opinion, Talleyrand bided his time. Working \nquietly, he eventually won over Castlereagh and Mettemich, the foreign \nministers of England and Austria. \nTogether these men baited Napoleon into escaping. Even Koller's visit, \nto whisper the promise of glory in the exile's ear, was part of the plan. Like \na master cardplayer, Talleyrand figured everything out in advance. He \nknew Napoleon would fall into the trap he had set. He also foresaw that \nNapoleon would lead the country into a war, which, given France's weak­\nened condition, could only last a few months . One diplomat in Vienna, \nwho understood that Talleyrand was behind it all, said, \"He has set the \nhouse ablaze in order to save it from the plague .\" \nWhen I have laid bait for deer, \nI don 't shoot at the first doe that comes to sniff, \nbut rpait until the whole herd has gathered mund. \nDito von Bismarck, 1815-1898 \nKEYS TO POWER \nHow many times has this scenario played itself out in history : An aggres­\nsive leader initiates aseries of bold moves that begin by bringing hirn \nmuch power. Slowly, however, his power reaches a peak, and soon every­\nthing turns against hirn. His numerous enemies band toget her; trying to \nmaintain his power, he exhausts hirnself going in this direction and that, \nand inevitably he collapses. The reason for this pattern is that the aggres­\nsive person is rarely in full control. He cannot see more than a couple of \nmoves ahead, cannot see the consequences of this bold move or that one. \nBecause he is constantly being forced to react to the moves of his ever­\ngrowing host of enemies, and to the unforeseen consequences of his own \nrash actions, his aggressive energy is turned against hirn. \nIn the realm of power, you must ask yoursel f, what is the point of chas­\ning here and there, trying to solve problems and defeat my enemies, if I \nnever feel in contro!? Why am I always having to react to events instead of \ndirecting them? The answer is simple: Your idea of power is wrong. You \nhave mistaken aggressive action for effective action. And most often the \nmost effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let others be frustrated \nby the traps you lay for them, playing for long-term power rather than \nquick victory. \nRememb er: The essence of power is the ability to keep the initiative, \nto get others to react to your moves, to keep YOUf opponent and those \naround you on the defensive. When you make other people come to you, \nyou suddenly become the one controlling the situation. And the one who \nhas control has power. Two things must happen to place you in this "

      "chapter_text": "meanwhil e, however, you must play on people's natural \ntendency to react angrily when pushed and baited. In the long run, the \nability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any \ntool of aggression. \nStudy how Talleyrand, the master of the art, performed this delicate \ntrick. First, he overcame the urge to try to convince his fellow statesmen \nthat they needed to banish Napoleon far away. It is only natural to want to \npersuade people by pleading YOUf case, imposing YOUf will with words. But \nthis often turns against you. Few of Talleyrand's contemporaries believed \nNapoleon was still a threat, so that if he had spent a lot of energy trying to \nconvince them, he would only have made himself look foolish. Instead, he \nheld his tongue and his emotions in check. Most important of all, he laid \nNapoleon a sweet and irresistible trap. He knew the man's weakness, his \nimpetuosity, his need for glory and the love of the masses, and he played \nall this to perfection. When Napoleon went for the bait, there was no dan­\nger that he might succeed and turn the tables on Talleyrand, who better \nthan anyone knew France's depleted state. And even had Napoleon been \nable to overcome these difficulties, the likelihood of bis success would have \nbeen greater were he able to choose his time and place of action. By setting \nthe proper trap, Talleyrand took the time and place into his own hands. \nAll of us have only so much energy, and there is a moment when OUf \nenergies are at their peak. When you make the other person come to you, \nhe wears himself out, wasting his energy on the trip. In the year 1905, Rus­\nsia and Japan were at war. The J apanese had only recently begun to mod­\nemize their warships, so that the Russians had a stronger navy, but by \nspreading false information the Japanese marshal Togo Heihachiro baited \nthe Russians into leaving their docks in the Baltic Sea, making them believe \nthey could wipe out the J apanese fleet in one swift attack. The Russian fleet \ncould not reach Japan by the quickest route-through the Strait of Gibral­\ntar and then the Suez Canal into the Indian Ocean- because these were \ncontrolled by the British, and Japan was an ally of Great Britain. They had \nto go around the Cape of Good Hope, at the southern tip of Africa, adding \nover more than six thousand miles to the voyage. Once the fleet passed the \nCape, the Japanese spread another false story: They were sailing to launch \na counterattack . So the Russians made the entire journey to Japan on com­\nbat alert. By the time they arrived, their seamen were tense, exhausted, and \noverworke d, while the Japanese had been waiting at their ease. Despite the \nLAW 8 65 \n66 LAW 8 odds and their lack of experience in modem naval warfare, the Japanese \ncrushed the Russians. \nOne added benefit of making the opponent come to you, as the Japa­\nnese discovered with the Russians, is that it forces hirn to operate in your \nterritory. Being on hostile ground will make hirn nervous and often he will \nrush his actions and make mistakes. For negotiations or meetings, it is al­\nways wise to lure others into your territory, or the territory of your choice. \nYou have your bearings, while they see nothing familiar and are subtly \nplaced on the defensive. \nManipulation is a dangerous game. Once someone suspects he is \nbeing manipulated, it becomes harder and harder to control hirn. But \nwhen you make your opponent come to you, you create the illusion that he \nis controlling the situation. He does not feel the strings that pull hirn, just as \nNapoleon imagined that he hirnself was the master of his daring escape and \nreturn to power. \nEverything depends on the sweetness of your bait. If your trap is at­\ntractive enough, the turbulence of your enemies' emotions and desires will \nblind them to reality. The greedier they become, the more they can be led \naround. \nThe great nineteenth-century robber baron Daniel Drew was a master \nat playing the stock market. When he wanted a particular stock to be \nbought or sold, driving prices up or down, he rarely resorted to the direct \napproach. One of his tricks was to hurry through an exclusive club near \nWall Street, obviously on his way to the stock exchange, and to pull out his \ncustomary red bandanna to wipe his perspiring brow. A slip of paper \nwould fall from this bandanna that he would pretend not to notice. The \nclub's members were always trying to foresee Drew's moves, and they \nwould pounce on the paper, which invariably seemed to contain an inside \ntip on a stock. Word would spread, and members would buy or seIl the \nstock in droves, playing perfectly into Drew's hands. \nIf you can get other people to dig their own graves, why sweat your­\nself? Pickpockets work this to perfection. The key to picking a pocket is \nknowing which pocket contains the wallet. Experienced pickpockets often \nply their trade in train stations and other places where there is a clearly \nmarked sign reading BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS . Passersby seeing the sign in­\nvariably feel for their wallet to make sure it is still there. For the watching \npickpockets, this is like shooting fish in a barrel. Pickpockets have even \nbeen known to place their own BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS signs to ensure \ntheir success. \nWhen you are making people come to you, it is sometimes better to let \nthem know you are forcing their hand. You give up deception for overt ma­\nnipulation. The psychological ramificati ons are profound: The person who \nmakes others come to hirn appears powernd, and demands respect. \nFilippo Brunelleschi, the great Renaissance artist and architect, was a \ngreat practitioner of the art of making others come to hirn as a sign of his \npower. On one occasion he had been engaged to repair the dome of the \nSanta Maria deI Fiore cathedral in Florence. The commission was impor-\ntaut and prestigious. But when the city officials hired a second man, \nLorenzo Ghiberti, to work with Brunelleschi, the great artist brooded in se­\ncret. He knew that Ghiberti had gotten the job through his connections, \nand that he would do none of the work and get half the credit. At a critical \nmoment of the construction, then, Brunelleschi suddenly developed a mys­\nterious illness. He had to stop work, but pointed out to city officials that \nthey had hired Ghiberti, who should have been able to continue the work \non his OWll. Soon it became dear that Ghiberti was useless and the officials \ncame begging to Brunelleschi. He ignored them, insisting that Ghiberti \nshould finish the project, until finally they realized the problem: They fired \nGhiberti. \nBy some mirade, Brunelleschi recovered within days. He did not have \nto throw a tautrum or make a fool of hirnself; he simply practiced the art of \n\"making others come to you.\" \nIf on one occasion you make it a point of dignity that others must \ncome to you and you succeed, they will continue to do so even after you \nstop trying. \nImage: The Honeyed \nBear Trap. The bear hunter \ndoes not chase his prey; a bear \nthat knows it is hunted is nearly \nimpossible to catch and is fero­\ncious if cornered. Instead, the \nhunter lays traps baited with \nhoney. He does not exhaust \nhimself and risk his life in \npursuit He baits, then waits. \nAuthority: Good warriors make others \ncome to them, and do not go to others. This \nis the principle of emptiness and fullness \nof others and self. When you induce oppo­\nnents to come to you, then their force is \nalways empty; as long as you do not \ngo to them, your force is always full. Attack­\ning emptiness with fullness is like throwing \nstones on eggs. (Zhang Yu, eleventh­\ncentury commen tator on The Art of War) \nLAW 8 67 \n68 LAW 8 REVERSAL \nAlthough it is generally the wiser policy to make others exhaust themselves \nchasing you, there are opposite cases where striking suddenly and aggres­\nsively at the enemy SO demoralizes hirn that his energies sink. Instead of \nmaking others come to you, you go to them, force the issue, take the lead. \nFast attack can be an awesome weapon, for it forces the other person to \nreact without the time to think or plan. With no time to think, people make \nerrors of judgment, and are thrown on the defensive. This tactic is the ob­\nverse of waiting and baiting, but it serves the same function: You make \nyour enemy respond on your terms. \nMen like Cesare Borgia and Napoleon used the element of speed to in­\ntimidate and control. A rapid and unforeseen move is terrifying and de­\nmoralizing. You must choose YOUf tactics depending on the situation. If \nyou have time on YOUf side, and know that you and your enemies are at \nleast at equal strength, then deplete their strength by making them come to \nyou. If time is against YOU-yOUf enemies are weaker, and waiting will only \ngive them the chance to recover-give them no such chance. Strike quickly \nand they have nowhere to go.

He had seen a couple of hefty ship's \nmasts in a shipyard in Athens a few days before, and he ordered that the \nlarger of these be sent to hirn immedia tely. The military engi neer in Ath ens \nwho received the order feit certain that the consul really wanted the \nsmaller of the masts . He argued endlessly with the soldiers who delive red \nthe request: The smaller mast, he told them, was much better suited to the \ntask. And indeed it would be easier to transport. \nThe soldiers warned the engi neer that their master was not a man to \nargue with, but he insisted that the smaller mast would be the only one that \nwould work with a machine that he was constructing to go with it. He drew \ndiagram after diag ram, and went so far as to say that he was the expert and \nthey had no clue what they were talking about. The soldiers knew their \nleader and at last convinced the engineer that it would be better to swallow \nhis expertise and obey . \nAfter they left, though, the engineer thought about it some more. What \nwas the point, he asked hirns elf, in obeying an order that would lead to fail­\nure? And so he sent the smaller mast, confident that the consul would see \nhow much more effective it was and reward hirn just ly. \nWhen the smaller mast arrived, Mucianus aske d his soldiers for an ex­\nplanat ion. They described to hirn how the engineer had argued endlessly \nfor the smaller mast, but had finally promised to send the larger one. Mu­\ncianus went into a rage . He could not concentrate on the siege, or consider \nthe importance of breaching the walls before the town received reinf orce­\nments. All he could think about was the impudent engineer, whom he or­\ndered to be brought to hirn immediately. \nArriving a few days later, the engi neer gladly explained to the consul, \none more time, the reasons for the smaller mast. He went on and on, using \nthe same arguments he had made with the soldiers. He said it was wise to \nlisten to experts in these matters, and if the attack was only tried with the \nbattering ram he had sent, the consul would not regret it. Mucianus let hirn \nfinish, then had him stripped naked before the soldiers and flogged and \nscourged with rods until he died. \nInterpretation \nThe engineer, whose name has not been recorded by history, had spent his \nlife designing masts and pillars, and was respected as the finest engineer in \na city that had excelled in the science. He knew that he was right. A smaller \nram would allow more speed and carry more force. Larger is not neces sar­\nily better. Of course the consul would see his logic, and would eventually \nunderstand that science is neutral and reason superior. How could the con­\nsul possibly persist in his ignorance if the engineer showed him detailed di­\nagrams and explained the theories behind his advi ce? \nThe military engineer was the quinte ssence of the Arguer, a type \nfound everywhere among uso The Arguer does not understand that words \nare never neutral, and that by arguing with a superior he impugns the intel­\nligenee of one more powerful than he. He also has no awareness of the per­\nson he is dealing with. Sinee each man believes that he is right, and words \nwill rarely eonvinee hirn otherw ise, the arguer's reasoning falls on deaf \nears. When eornered, he only argues more, digging his own grave. Onee \nhe has made the other person feel inseeure and inferior in his beliefs, the \neloquenee of Socrates could not save the situation. \nIt is not simply a question of avoiding an argument with those who \nstand above you. We all believe we are masters in the realm of opinions \nand reasoning. You must be careful, then: Learn to demonstrate the cor­\nrectness of your ideas indirectly. \nOBSER VA NC E OF THE LAW \nIn 1502, in Florenee, Italy, an enormous block of marble stood in the \nworks department of the church of Santa Maria deI Fiore. It had once been \na magnificent piece of raw stone, but an unskillful sculptor had mistakenly \nbored a hole through it where there should have been a figure's legs, gen­\nerally mutilating it. Piero Soderini, Florence's mayor, had contemplated \ntrying to save the block by eommissioning Leonardo da Vinci to work on \nit, or some other master, but had given up, since everyone agreed that the \nstone had been ruined. So, despite the money that had been wasted on it, it \ngathered dust in the dark halls of the church. \nThis was where things stood until some Florentine friends of the great \nMichelangelo decided to write to the artist, then living in Rome. He alone, \nthey said, could do something with the marble, which was still magnificent \nraw material . Michelangelo traveled to Florence, examined the stone, and \neame to the conclusion that he could in fact carve a fine figure from it, by \nadapting the pose to the way the rock had been mutilate d. Soderini argued \nthat this was a waste of time- nobody could salvage such a disaster-but \nhe finally agreed to let the artist work on it. Michelangelo decided he \nwould depict a young David, sling in hand. \nWeeks later, as Michelangelo was putting the final touch es on the \nstatue, Soderini entered the studio. Fancying hirnself a bit of a connoisseur, \nhe studied the huge work, and told Michelangelo that while he thought it \nwas magnificent, the nose, he judged, was too big. Michelangelo realized \nthat Soderini was standing in a place right under the giant figure and did \nnot have the proper perspeetive. Without a word, he gestured for Soderini \nto follow hirn up the scaffolding. Reaching the nose, he picked up his \nehisel, as well as a bit of marble dust that lay on the planks. With Soderini \njust a few feet below hirn on the scaffolding, Michelangelo started to tap \nlightly with the ehisel, letting the bits of dust he had gathered in his hand to \nfall little by little. He actually did nothing to change the nose, but gave \nevery appearance of working on it. Mter a few minutes of this charade he \nstood aside: \"Look at it now.\" \"I like it better,\" replied Soderini, \"you've \nmade it come alive.\" dogs. lIe ofJ,'red Ihis \nman the one hundred \ngold pieces (lnd said. \n\"LeI me look aJler Ihe \ndogs Jor ten days. \" The \nhunlsrnan agre<'d. anti \nJor Ihe nexl ten day.\\· the \nvizier cared for fhe \nhellsls wilh greal alIen­\nIion, grooming Ihem \nweil andfeeding thCln \nh(/fulsomely.

He \nbelonged to the district \nof Sais and was a \nnative of the town \ncal/ed Siuph. At first \nthe Egyptians were \ninclined to be contemp­\ntuous, and did not \nthink much of him \nbecause ofhis humble \nand undistinguished \norigin; but later on he \ncleverly brought them \nto heel, without having \nrecourse to harsh \nmeasures. \nAmongst his innumer­\nable treasures, he had a \ngold footbath, whieh he \nand his guests used on \noccasion to wash their \nfeet in. This he broke \nup, and with the mate­\nrial had a statue made \nto one of the gods, \nwhich he then set up in \nwhat he thought the \nmost suitable spot in \nthe city. The Egyptians \nconstantly eoming \nupon the statue, treated \nit with profound re ver­\nenee, and as soon as \nAmasis heard of the \neffeet it had upon them, \nhe cal/ed a meeting and \nrevealed the fact that \nthe deeply revered \nstatue was unce a foot­\nbath, which they \nwashed their feet and \npissed and vomited in. \nHe went on to say that \nhis own case was much \nthe same, in that on ce \nhe had been only an \nordinary person and \nwas now their king; so \nthat just as they had \ncome to revere the \ntransformed footbath, \nso they had better pay \n72 LAW 9 Interpretation \nMichelangelo knew that by changing the shape of the nose he might ruin \nthe entire sculptu re. Yet Soderini was a patron who prided hirnself on his \naesthetic judgment. To offend such a man by arguing would not only gain \nMichelangelo nothing, it would put future commissions in jeop ardy. \nMichelangelo was too clever to argue. His solution was to change \nSoderini 's perspe ctive (literally bringing hirn closer to the no se) without \nmaking hirn reaHze that this was the cause of bis misp erception. \nFortunately for posterity, Michelangelo found a way to keep the per­\nf�ction of the statue intact while at the same time making Soderini believe \nhe had improved it. Such is the double power of winning through actions \nrather than argum ent: No one is off ended, and your point is proven. \nKEYS TO POWER \nIn the realm of power you must leam to judge your moves by their long­\nterm effects on other people. The problem in trying to prove a point or \ngain a victory through argument is that in the end you can never be certain \nhow it aff ects the people you're arguing with: They may appear to agree \nwith you politely, but inside they may resent you. Or perhaps something \nyou said inadvertently even off ended them-words have that insidious \nability to be interpreted according to the other person's mood and insec uri­\nties. Even the best argument has no solid foundation, for we have all come \nto distrust the slippery nature of words. And days after agreeing with some­\none, we often revert to our old opinion out of sheer habit. \nUnderstand this: Wo rds are a dime a dozen. Everyone knows that in \nthe heat of an argument, we will all say anything to support our cause. We \nwill quote the Bible, refer to unverifiable statistics. Who can be persuaded \nby bags of air like that? Action and demonstration are much more power­\nful and meaningful. They are there, before our eyes, for us to se�\"Yes, \nnow the statue's no se does look just right. \" There are no offensive words, \nno poss ibility of misinterpretat ion. No one can argue with ademonstrated \nproof. As Baltasar Graciän remarks, \"The truth is generally seen, rarely \nheard.\" \nSir Christopher Wren was Englan d's version of the Rena issance man. \nHe had mastered the sciences of mathematics, astronomy, physics, and \nphysiology. Yet during bis extremely long career as Englan d's most cele­\nbrated archite ct he was often told by his patrons to make impractical \nchanges in his designs . Never once did he argue or offend. He had other \nways of proving his point. \nIn 1688 Wren desig ned a magnificent town hall for the city of West­\nminster. The mayor, however, was not satisfied; in fact he was nervous. He \ntold Wren he was afraid the second floor was not seeure, and that it could \nall come crashing down on his office on the first floor. He demanded that \nWren add two stone columns for extra support. Wren, the consummate en­\ngineer, knew that these columns would serve no purpose, and that the \nmayor's fears were baseless. But build them he did, and the mayor was \ngrateful. It was only years later that workmen on a high scaffold saw that \nthe columns stopped just short of the ceiling. \nThey were dumm ies. But both men got what they wanted: The mayor \ncould relax, and Wren knew posterity would understand that his original \ndesign worked and the columns were unnecessa ry. \nThe power of demonstrating your idea is that your opponents do not \nget defensive, and are therefore more open to persuasion. Making them lit­\nerally and physically feel your meaning is infinitely more powerful than ar­\ngument. \nA heckler once interru pted Nikita Khrushchev in the middle of a \nspeech in which he was denouncing the crimes of Stalin. \"Y ou were a col­\nleague of Stalin's,\" the heckler yelled, \"why didn't you stop hirn then?\" \nKhrushschev apparently could not see the heckler and barked out, \"Who \nsaid that?\" No hand went up. No one moved a muscle. After a few seconds \nof tense silen ce, Khrushchev finally said in a quiet voice, \"Now you know \nwhy I didn't stop hirn.\" Instead of just arguing that anyone facing Stalin \nwas afraid, knowing that the slightest sign of rebellion would mean certain \ndeath, he had made them feel what it was like to face Stalin-had made \nthem feel the paranoia, the fear of speaking up, the terror of confronting \nthe leader, in this case Khrushchev. The demonstration was visceral and no \nmore argument was necessary. \nThe most powerful persuasion goes beyond action into symbol. The \npower of a symbol-a flag, a mythic story, a monument to some emotional \nevent-is that everyone understands you without anything being said. In \n1975, when Henry Kissinger was engaged in some frustrating negotiations \nwith the Israelis over the return of part of the Sinai desert that they had \nseized in the 1967 war, he suddenly broke off a tense meeting and decided \nto do some sight-seeing. He paid a visit to the ruins of the ancient fortress \nof Masada, known to all Israelis as the place where seven hundred J ewish \nwarriors committed mass suicide in A.D. 73 rather than give in to the \nRoman troops besieging them. The Israelis instantly underst ood the mes­\nsage of Kissing er's visit: He was indirectly accusing them of courting mass \nsuicide. Although the visit did not by itself change their minds, it made \nthem think far more seriously than any direct warning would have. Sym­\nbols like this one carry great emotional significan ce. \nWhen aiming for power, or trying to conserve it, always look for the \nindirect route. And also choose your battles carefully. If it does not matter \nin the long run whether the other person agrees with you-or if time and \ntheir own experience will make them understand what you mean-then it \nis best not even to bother with a demonstrat ion.

Once Count \nVictor Lustig, swindler par excellence, had sold dozens of suckers around \nthe country a phony box with which he claimed to be able to copy money. \nDiscovering their mistake, the suckers generally chose not to go the police, \nrather than risk the embarrassment of publicity. But one Sheri ff Richards, \nof Remsen County, Oklahoma, was not the kind of man to accept being \nconned out of $10,000, and one moming he tracked Lustig down to a hotel \nin Chicago. \nLustig heard a knock on the door. When he opened it he was looking \ndown the barrel of a gun . \"What seems to be the problem ?\" he calmly \nasked. \"You son of a bitch,\" yelled the sheriff, \"1'm going to kill you. You \nconned me with that damn box of yours!\" Lustig feigned confusion. \"You \nmean it's not working?\" he asked. \"You know it's not working, \" replied the \nsheriff. \"But that's impossible,\" said Lustig. \"There 's no way it couldn't be \nworking. Did you operate it proper ly?\" \"I did exactly what you told me to \ndo,\" said the sheriff. \"No, you must have done something wrong, \" said \nLustig. The argument went in circles. The barrel ofthe gun was gently low­\nered. \nLustig next went to phase two in the argument tactic: He poured out a \nwhole bunch of technical gobbledygook about the box's operation, com­\npletely beguiling the sheriff, who now appeared less sure of himself and ar­\ngued less forcefully. \"Look,\" said Lustig, \"1'11 give you your money back \nright now. 1'11 also give you written instructions on how to work the ma­\nchine and 1'11 come out to Oklahoma to make sure it's working properly. \nThere's no way you can lose on that.\" The sheriff reluctantly agreed. To \nsatisfy him tota1ly, Lustig took out a hundred one-hundred-dollar bills and \ngave them to him, telling him to relax and have a fun weekend in Chicago. \nCalmer and a little confused, the sheriff finally left. Over the next few days \nLustig checked the paper every moming. He finally found what he was \nlooking for: A short article reporting Sheriff Richar ds's arrest, trial, and \nconviction for passing counte rfeit notes. Lustig had won the argument; the \nsheriff never bothered hirn again. \nLAW 9 75 \n76 LAW \n10 \nIN FE CTIO N: AV OID THE \nUNH AP PY AN D UN LUC KY \nJUDGMENT \nYou can die from someone else's misery-emotional states \nare as infectious as diseases.

Taking the name \nLola Montez (her mother was of distant Spanish descent), she claimed to \nbe a flamenco dancer from Spain. By 1845 her career was languishing, and \nto survive she became a courtesan-quickly one of the more successful in \nParis. \nOnly one man could salvage Lola's dancing career: Alexandre Du­\njarier, owner of the newspaper with the largest circulation in France, and \nalso the newspaper's drama critic. She decided to woo and conquer hirn. \nInvestigating his habits, she discovered that he went riding every morning. \nAn excellent horsewoman herself, she rode out one moming and \"acciden­\ntalIy\" ran into hirn. Soon they were riding together every day. A few weeks \nlater Lola moved into his apartment. \nFor a while the two were happy together. With Dujarier's help, Lola \nbegan to revive her dancing career. Despite the risk to his social standing, \nDujarier told friends he would marry her in the spring. (Lola had never \ntold hirn that she had eloped at age nineteen with an Englishman, and was \nstilliegally married.) Although Dujarier was deeply in love, rns life started \nto slide downhill. \nHis fortunes in business changed and influential friends began to avoid \nhirn. One night Dujarier was invited to a party, attended by some of the \nwealthiest young men in Paris. Lola wanted to go too but he would not \nallow it. They had their first quarrel, and Dujarier attended the party by \nhirnself. There, hopelessly drunk, he insulted an influential drama critic, \nJean-Baptiste Rosemond de Beauvalion, perhaps because of something the \ncritic had said about Lola. The following morning Beauvalion challenged \nhirn to a duel. Beauvalion was one of the best pistol shots in France. Du­\njarier tried to apologize, but the duel took place, and he was shot and \nkilled. Thus ended the life of one of the most promising young men of \nParis society. Devastated, Lola left Paris. \nIn 1846 Lola Montez found herself in Munich, where she decided to \nwoo and conquer King Ludwig of Bavaria. The best way to Ludwig, she \ndiscovered, was through his aide-de-camp, Count Otto von Rechberg, a \nman with a fondness for pretty girls. One day when the count was break­\nfasting at an outdoor cafe, Lola rode by on her horse, was \"accidentally\" \nthrown from the saddle, and landed at Rechberg's feet. The count rushed \nto help her and was enchanted. He promised to introduce her to Ludwig. \nRechberg arranged an audience with the king for Lola, but when she \narrived in the anteroom, she could hear the king saying he was too busy to \nmeet a favor-seeking stranger. Lola pushed aside the sentries and entered \nhis roorn anyway. In the process, the front of her dress somehow got tom \n(perhaps by her, perhaps by one of the sentries), and to the astonishment of \nall, most especially the king, her bare breasts were brazenly exposed. Lola \nwas granted her audience with Ludwig. Fifty-five hours later she made her \ndebut on the Bavarian stage; the reviews were terrible, but that did not stop \nLudwig from arranging more performan ces.

He started \nto appear in public with her on his arm, and then he bought and furnished \nan apartment for her on one of Munich's most fashionable boulevards. Al­\nthough he had been known as amiser, and was not given to flights of \nfancy, he started to shower Lola with gifts and to write poetry for her. Now \nhis favored mistress, she catapulted to farne and fortune ovemight. \nLola began to lose her sense of proportion. One day when she was out \nriding, an elderly man rode ahead of her, a bit too slowly for her liking. \nUnable to pass him, she began to slash hirn with her riding crop. On an­\nother occasion she took her dog, unleashed, out for a stroll. The dog at­\ntacked a passerby, but instead of helping the man get the dog away, she \nwhipped hirn with the leash. Incidents like this infuriated the stolid citizens \nof Bavaria, but Ludwig stood by Lola and even had her naturalized as a \nBavarian cit izen. The king's entourage tried to wake hirn to the dangers of \nthe affair, but those who criticized Lola were surnmarily fired. \nWhile Bavarians who had loved their king now outwardly disre­\nspected hirn, Lola was made a countess, had a new palace built for herself, \nand began to dabble in politics, advising Ludwig on policy. She was the \nmost powernd force in the kingdom. Her influence in the king's cabinet \ncontinued to grow, and she treated the other ministers with disdain. As a \nresult, riots broke out throughout the realm. A once peaceful land was vir­\ntually in the grip of civil war, and students everywhere were chanting, \n''Raus mit Lola!\" \nBy February of 1848, Ludwig was finally unable to withstand the pres­\nsure. With great sadness he ordered Lola to leave Bavaria immediately. \nShe left, but not until she was paid off. For the next five weeks the Bavari­\nans' wrath was tumed against their formerly beloved king. In March of that \nyear he was forced to abdicate. \nLola Montez moved to England. More than anything she needed re­\nspectability, and despite being marrie d (she still had not arrange d a divorce \nfrom the Englishman she had wed years before), she set her sights on \nGeorge Trafford Heald, a promising young army officer who was the son of \nan influential barrister. Although he was ten years younger than Lola, and \ncould have chosen a wife among the prettiest and wealthiest young girls of \nEnglish society, Heald fell under her speIl. They were married in 1849. \nSoon arrested on the charge of bigamy, she skipped bail, and she and \nHeald made their way to Spain. They quarreled horribly and on one occa­\nsion Lola slashed him with a knife. Finally, she drove him away. Retuming \nto England, he found he had lost his position in the army. Ostracized from \nEnglish society, he moved to Portugal, where he lived in poverty. After a \nfew months his short life ended in a boating accident. \nA few years later the man who published Lola Montez' s autobiogra­\nphy went bankrupt \nIn 1853 Lola moved to Califomia, where she met and married a man \nnamed Pat Hull. Their relationship was as stormy as all the others, and she \nleft Hull for another man. He took to drink and fell into a deep depression \nthat lasted until he died, four years later, still a relatively young man. \nAt the age of forty-one, Lola gave away her clothes and finery and \nturned to God. She toured America, lecturing on religious topics, dressed \nin white and wearing a halolike white headgear. She died two years later, in \n1861. \nInterpretation \nLola Montez attracted men with her wiles, but her power over them went \nbeyond the sexual . It was through the force of her character that she kept \nher lovers enthrall ed. Men were sucked into the maelstrom she churned up \naround her. They feIt confused, upset, but the strength of the emotions she \nstirred also made them feel more alive. \nAs is often the case with infection, the problems would only arise over \ntime. Lola's inherent instability would begin to get under her lovers' skin. \nThey would find themselves drawn into her problems, but their emotional \nattac hment to her would make them want to help her. This was the crucial \npoint of the diseas e--for Lola Montez could not be helped. Her problems \nwere too deep. Once the lover identified with them, he was lost. He would \nfind hirnself embroiled in quarre Is. The infection would spread to his fam­\nily and friends, or, in the case of Ludwig, to an entire nation. The only so­\nlution would be to cut her off, or suffer an eventual colla pse. \nThe inf ecting-character type is not restricted to women; it has nothing \nto do with gender. It sterns from an inward instability that radiates outward, \ndrawing dis aster upon itself. There is almost adesire to destroy and unset­\ntle.

Cassius, the Roman \nconspirator agai nstJulius Caesar, had the discontent that comes from deep \nenvy. He simply could not endure the presence of anyone of greater talent. \nProbably because Caesar sensed the man's intermina ble soumess, he \npassed hirn up for the position of first praetorship, and gave the position to \nBrutus instead. Cassius brooded and broorl.ed, his hatred for Caesar be­\ncoming pathological. Brutus himself, a devoted republican, disliked Cae­\nsar's dictat orship ; had he had the patience to wait, he would have become \nthe first man in Rome after Caesar's death, and could have undone the evil \nthat the leader had wrought. But Cassius infected hirn with his own rancor, \nbending his ear daily with tales of Caesar's evil. He finally won Brutus over \nto the conspiracy. It was the beginning of a great tragedy. How many mis­\nfortunes could have been avoided had Brutus learned to fear the power of \ninfection. \nThere is only one solution to infection: quarantine.

They are a source of plea­\nsure, and you must associate with them to share in the prosper ity they draw \nupon themselves. \nThis applies to more than good cheer and success: All positive quali­\nties can infect uso Talleyrand had many strange and intimidating traits, but \nmost agreed that he surpassed all Frenchmen in graciousness, aristocratic \ncharm, and wit. Indeed he came from one of the oldest noble families in \nthe country, and despite his belief in democracy and the French Republic, \nhe retained his courtly manners. His contemporary Napoleon was in many \nways the opposit e--a peasant from Corsica, tacitum and ungracious, even \nviolent. \nThere was no one Na poleon admired more than Talleyrand. He en­\nvied his minister's way with people, his wit and his ability to c.l,arm \nwomen, and as best he could, he kept Talleyrand around him, hoping to \nsoak up the culture he lacked. There is no doubt that Napoleon changed as \nhis rule cvntinued. Many of the rough edges were smoothed by his con­\nstaut association with Talleyrand . \nUse the positive side of this emotional osmosis to advantage. If, for ex­\nample, you are miserly by nature, you will never go beyond a certain limit; \nonly generous souls attain greatness. Associate with the generous, then, \nand they will infect you, opening up everything that is tight and restricted \nin you. If you are gloomy, gravitate to the cheerful. If you are prone to iso­\nlation, force yourself to befriend the gregarious. Never associate with those \nwho share your defects-they will reinforce everything that holds you \nback. Only create associations with positive affinities. Make this a rule of \nlife and you will benefit more than from all the therapy in the world. \nREVERSAL Authority: Recognize the fortu­\nnate so that you may choose \ntheir company, and the unf ortu­\nnate so that you may avoid \nthem. Misfortune is usually the \ncrime of folly, and among those \nwho suf fer from it there is no \nmalady more contagious: Never \nopen your door to the least of \nmisfortunes, for, if you do, many \nothers will follow in its train .... \nDo not die of another's misery. \n(Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) \nThis law admits of no reversal.

How could the good citizens of Siena reward hirn? No amount of \nmoney or honor could possibly compare in value to the preservation of a \ncity's liberty. The citizens thought of making the mercenary the lord of the \ncity, but even that, they decided, wasn't recompense enough. At last one of \nthem stood before the assembly called to debate this matter and said, \"Let \nus kill hirn and then worship hirn as our patron saint.\" And so they did. \nThe Count of Carmagnola was ene of the bravest and most successful \nof all the condottieri. In 1442, late in his life, he was in the employ of the city \nof Venice, which was in the midst of a long war with Florence. The count \nwas suddenly recalled to Venice. A favorite of the people, he was received \nthere with all kinds of honor and splendor. That evening he was to dine \nwith the doge hirnself, in the doge's palace. On the way into the palace, \nhowever, he noticed that the guard was leading hirn in a different direction \nfrom usual. Crossing the famous Bridge of Sighs, he suddenly realized \nwhere they were taking him-to the dunge on. He was convicted on a \ntrumped-up charge and the next day in the Piazza San Marco, before a \nhorrified crowd who could not understand how his fate had changed so \ndrastically, he was beheaded. \nInterpretation \nMany of the great condottieri of Renaissance Italy suffered the same fate as \nthe patron saint of Siena and the Count of Carmagno la: They won battle \nafter battle for their employers only to find themselves banished, impris­\noned, or executed. The problem was not ingratit ude; it was that there were \nso many other condottieri as able and valiant as they were. They were re­\nplaceable. Nothing was lost by killing them. Meanwhi le, the older among \nthem had grown powerful themselve s, and wanted more and more money \nfor their services. How much better, then, to do away with them and hire a \nyounge r, cheaper mercenary. That was the fate of the Count of Carma­\ngnola, who had started to act impudently and independe ntly. He had taken \nhis power for granted without making sure that he was truly indispensable. \nSuch is the fate (to a less violent degree, one hopes) of those who do \nnot make others dependent on them. Sooner or later someone comes along \nwho can do the job as weIl as they can-someone younger, fresher, less ex­\npensive, less threatening. \nBe the only one who can do what you do, and make the fate of those who \nhire you so entwin ed with yours that they cannot possibly get rid of you. \nOtherwise you will someday be forced to cross your own Bridge of Sighs. \nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW \nWhen Qtto von Bismarck became a deputy in the Prussian parliament in \n1847, he was thirty-two years old and without an ally or friend.

It was with the king, Frederick William IV. This was \nan odd choice to say the least, for Frederick was at a low point of his power. \nA weak, indecisive man, he consis tently gave in to the liberals in parlia­\nment; in fact he was spineless, and stood for much that Bismarck disliked, \npersonally and politically. Yet Bismarck courted Frederick night and day. \nWhen other deputies attacked the king for his many inept moves, only Bis­\nmarck stood by hirn. \nFinally, it all paid off: In 1851 Bismarck was made a minister in the \nking's ca))inet. Now he went to work. Time and again he forced the king's \nhand, getting rum to build up the military, to stand up to the liberals, to do \nexactly as Bismarck wished. He worked on Frederick's insecurity about his \nmanliness, challenging rum to be firm and to mle with pride. And he \nslowly restored the king's powers until the monarchy was once again the \nmost powernd force in Prussia. \nWhen Frederick died, in 1861, his brother William assumed the \nthrone. William disliked Bismarck intensely and had no intention of keep­\ning hirn around. But he also inherited the same situation his brother had: \nenernies galore, who wanted to rubble his power away. He actually consid­\nered abdicating, feeling he lacked the strength to deal with this dangerous \nand precarious position. But Bismarck insinuated hirnself once again. He \nstood by the new king, gave hirn strength, and urged hirn into firm and de­\ncisive action. The king grew dependent on Bismarck's strong-arm tactics to \nkeep his enemies at bay, and despite his antipathy toward the man, he soon \nmade rum his prime minister. The two quarreled often over policy­\nBismarck was much more conservative-but the king understood his own \ndependency. Whenever the prime minister threatened to resign, the king \ngave in to rum, time after time. It was in fact Bismarck who set state policy. \nYears later, Bismarck's actions as Prussia's prime minister led the vari­\nous German state� to be united into one country. Now Bismarck finagled \nthe king into letting hirnself be crowned emperor of Germany. Yet it was \nreally Bismarck who had reached the heights of power. As right-hand man \nto the emperor, and as imperial chancellor and knighted prince, he pulled \nall the levers. \nInterpretation \nMost young and ambitious politicians looking out on the politicallandscape \nof 1840s Germany would have tried to build a power base among those \nwith the most power. Bismarck saw different. Joirung forces with the pow­\nernd can be foolish: They will swallow you up, just as the doge of Venice \nswallowed up the Count of Carmagnola. No one will come to depend on \nyou if they are already strong. If you are ambitious, it is much wiser to seek \nout weak mlers or masters with whom you can create a relationsrup of de­\npendency. You become their strength, their intelligence, their spine. What \npower you hold! If they got rid of you the whole edifice would collapse. \nNecessity mIes the world. People rarely act unless compelled to. If you \ncreate no need for yourse lf, then you will be done away with at first oppor­\ntunity. If, on the other hand, you understand the Laws of Power and make \nothers depend on you for their welfare, if you can counteract their weak­\nness with your own \"iron and blood,\" in Bismarck's phrase, then you will \nsUlvive your masters as Bismarck did. You will have all the benefits of \npower without the thoms that come from being a master. \nThus a wise prince will think 0/ ways to keep his citizens 0/ every sart \nand under every circumstance dependent on the state and on him; \nand then they will always be trustworthy. \nNiccolo Machia velli, 1469-1527 \nKEYS TO POWER \nThe ultimate power is the power to get people to do as you wish. When you \ncan do this without having to force people or hurt them, when they will­\ningly grant you what you desire, then your power is untouchab le. The best \nway to achieve this position is to create a relationship of dependence. The \nmaster requires your services; he is weak, or unable to function without \nyou; you have enmeshed yourself in his work so deeply that doing away \nwith you would bring hirn great difficulty, or at least would mean valuable \ntime lost in training another to replace you. Once such a relationship is es­\ntablished you have the upper hand, the leverage to make the master do as \nyou wish. It is the classic case of the man behind the throne, the servant of \nthe king who actually controls the king. Bismarck did not have to bully ei­\nther Frederick or William into doing his bidding. He simply made it clear \nthat unless he got what he wanted he would walk away, leaving the king to \ntwist in the wind. Both kings soon danced tn Bismarck's tune. \nDo not be one of the many who mistakenly believe that the ultimate \nform of power is independence. Power involves a relationship between \npeople; you will always need others as allies, pawns, or even as weak mas­\nters who serve as your front. The completely independent man would live \nin a cabin in the woods-he would have the freedom to come and go as he \npleased, but he would have no power. The best you can hope for is that \nothers will grow so dependent on you that you enjoy a kind of reverse in­\ndepende nce: Their need for you frees you. \nLouis XI (1423-1483), the great Spider King of France, had a weak­\nness for astrology. He kept a court astrologer whom he admired, until one \nday the man predicted that a lady of the court would die within eight days. \nWhen the prophecy came true, Louis was terrified, thinking that either the \nman had murdered the woman to prove his accuracy or that he was so \nversed in his science that his powers threatened Louis hirnself. In either \ncase he had to be killed. \nOne evening Louis summoned the astrologer to his room, high in the \ncastle. Before the man arrived, the king told his servants that when he gave Tm: EL\\I-TBI ': E \\\\1> \n1'11 1,: \\ 1\\1-' \nAn extravagant young \nVinc, vainly amhitious \nof irulependencc, and \nfond of ramhling al \nlarge, despised the \nalliance of a stately elm \nIhat grew near, ami \ncourted her emhraces. \nHaving risen to some \nsmall height withoul \nany kind o[su pport, \nshe shol forth her \nflimsy branches to a \nvery uncomnwn und \nsuper(lu ous lengI\"; \ncalling on her neigh­\nhour 10 lake notice how \n!iule she wunled his \nassislance. \"Poor injll l­\nuated shrub,\" replied \nthe elm, \"how inconsis­\ntent is thy conduct! \nWouldsltho/l he truly \nindependent, Ilwu \nshouldsl carefully \napply those juices to \nIhe enlargement of Ihy \nstem, which thou \nlavishest in vain upon \nunnecessary j(,!iag!'.

The man's life was spared. The Spider \nKing not only protected bis astrologer for as long as he was alive, he lav­\nished him with gifts and had him tended by the finest court doctor s. \nThe astrologer survived Louis by several years, disproving his power \nof prophecy but proving his mastery of power. \nThis is the model: Make others dependent on you. To get rid of you \nmight spell disaster, even death, and your master dares not tempt fate by \nfinding out. There are many ways to obtain such ap osition. Foremost \namong them is to possess a talent and crea tive skill that simply cannot be \nrepla ced. \nDuring the Renaissance, the major obstacle to a painter's success was \nfinding the right patron. Michelangelo did this better than anyone else: His \npatron was Pope Julius H. But he and the pope quarreled over the building \nof the pope's marble tomb , and Michelangelo left Rome in disgust. To the \namazement of those in the pope's circle, not only did the pope not fire him, \nhe sought him out and in his own haughty way begged the artist to stay. \nMichelange lo, he knew, could find another patron, but he could never find \nanother Michelan gelo. \nYou do not have to have the talent of a Michelan gelo; you do have to \nhave a skill that sets you apart from the crowd. You should create a situa­\ntion in which you can always latch on to another master or patron but your \nmaster cannot easily find another servant with your particular talent. And \nif, in reality, you are not actually indispensable, you must find a way to \nmake it look as if you are. Having the appearance of specialized knowledge \nand skill gives you leeway in your ability to deceive those above you into \nthinking they cannot do without you. Real dependence on your master' s \npart, however, leaves him more vulnerable to you than the faked variety, \nand it is always within your power to make your skill indisp ensa ble. \nThis is what is meant by the intertwining of fate s: Like creeping ivy, \nyou have wrapp ed yourself around the source of power, so that it would \ncause great trauma to cut you away. And you do not neces sarily have to en­\ntwine yourself around the master ; another person will do, as long as he or \nshe too is indispensable in the chain. \nOne day Harry Cohn, president of Columbia Picture s, was visited in \nhis office by a gloomy group of his executiv es. It was 1951, when the witch­\nhunt against Communists in Holl ywood, carried on by the U.S. Cong ress's \nHouse Un-American Activit ies Commit tee, was at its height. The execu­\ntives had bad news: One of their employ ees, the screenwriter John Howard \nLawson, had been sing led out as a Communist. They had to get rid of him \nright away or suffer the wrath of the committe e. \nHarry Cohn was no bleeding-heart liberal; in fact, he had always been \na die-hard Republican. \nHis favorite politician was Benito Mussolini, whom he had once vis­\nited, and whose framed photo hung on his wall. If there was someone he \nhated Cohn would call him a \"Communist bastard .\" But to the executives' \namazement Cohn told them he would not fire Lawson. He did not keep the \nscreenwriter on because he was a good writer-th ere were many good \nwriters in Hollywo od. He kept hirn because of achain of dependence: \nLawson was Humphrey Bogart's writer and Bogart was Columbia's star. If \nCohn messed with Lawson he would ruin an immensely profitable rela­\ntionship . That was worth more than the terrible publicity brought to hirn \nby his defiance of the committe e. \nHenry Kissinger managed to survive the many bloodlettings that went \non in the Nixon White House not because he was the best diplomat Nixon \ncould find-th ere were other fine negotiators-and not because the two \nmen got along so well: They did not. Nor did they share their beliefs and \npolitics. Kissinger survived because he entrenched hirnself in so many \nareas of the political structure that to do away with hirn would lead to \nchaos. Michelange lo's power was intensive, depending on one skilI, his abil­\nity as an artist; Kissinger's was extensive. He got hirnself involved in so \nmany aspects and departments of the administration that his involvement \nbecame a card in his hand. It also made hirn many allies. If you can \narrange such a position for yourself , getting rid of you becomes \ndangerous-all sorts of interdependencies will unravel . Still, the intensive \nform of power provides more freedom than the extensive, because those \nwho have it depend on no particular master, or particular position of \npower, for their security. \nTo make others dependent on you, one route to take is the secret­\nintelligence tactic. By knowing other people's secrets, by holding informa­\ntion that they wouldn't want broadcast, you seal your fate with theirs. You \nare untouc hable. Ministers of secret police have held this position through­\nout the ages: They can make or break a king, or, as in the case of J. Edgar \nHoover, a president. But the role is so full of insecurities and paranoia that \nthe power it provides almost cancels itself out. You cannot rest at ease, and \nwhat good is power if it brings you no peace? \nOne last waming: Do not imagine that your master's dependence on \nyou will make him love you. In fact, he may resent and fear you. But, as \nMachia velli said, it is better to be feared than loved. Fear you can control; \nlove, never. Depending on an emotion as subtle and changea ble as love or \nfriendship will only make you insecure. Better to have others depend on \nyou out of fear of the consequences of losing you than out of love of your \ncompany. \nLAW 11 87 \nImage: Vines with Many Thorns. Below, the roots grow deep \nand wide. Above, the vines push through bushes, entwine themselv es \n88 LAW 11 around trees and poles and window ledges. To get rid of them \nwould cost such toil and blood, it is easier to let them climb. \nREVERSAL Authority : Make people depend on \nyou. More is to be gained from \nsuch dependence than courtesy. He \nwho has slaked his thirst, immedi­\nately turns his back on the well, \nno longer needing it. When depen­\ndence disappears, so does civility \nand decency, and then respect. \nThe first lesson which experience \nshould te ach you is to keep hope \nalive but never satisfied, keeping \neven a royal patron ever in need of \nyou. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) \nThe weakness of making others depend on you is that you are in some \nmeasure dependent on them. But trying to move beyond that point means \ngetting rid of those above you-it means standing alone, depending on no \none. Such is the monopolistic drive of aJ. P. Morgan or aJohn D. Rocke­\nfeller-to drive out all competition, to be in complete control. If you can \ncorner the market, so much the better. \nNo such independence comes without a price. You are forced to isolate \nyourself. Monopolies often turn inward and destroy themselves from the in­\nternal pressure. They also stir up powernd resentment, making their ene­\nmies bond together to fight them. The drive for complete control is often \nruinous and fruitless. Interdependence remains the law, independence a \nrare and often fatal exception. Better to place yourself in a position of mu­\ntual dependence, then, and to follow this critical law rather than look for its \nreversal. You will not have the unbearable pressure ofbeing on top, and the \nmaster above you will in essence be your slave, for he will depend on you. \nLAW \n12 \nUSE SE LE CTIVE HO NESTY \nAND GE NEROSITY TO \nDISAR M YO UR VICT IM \nJUDGMENT \nOne sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of \ndishonest ones.

Speaking with an elegant Continental \naccent, the man introduced hirnself as Count Victor Lustig. He promised \nthat if Capone gave hirn $50,000 he could double it. Capone had more \nthan enough funds to cover the \"investment, \" but he wasn't in the habit of \nentrusting large sums to total strange rs. He looked the count over: Some­\nthing about the man was different-his classy style, his manner-and so \nCapone decided to play along. He counted out the bills persona lly and \nhanded them to Lustig. \"Okay, Count, \" said Capone. \"Double it in sixty \ndays like you said.\" Lustig left with the money, put it in a safe-deposit box \nin Chicago, then headed to New York, where he had several other money­\nmaking schemes in progress. \nThe $50,000 remained in the bank box untouc hed. Lustig made no ef­\nfort to double it. Two months later he retumed to Chicago, took the money \nfrom the box, and paid Capone another visit. He looked at the gangste r's \nstony-f aced bodyguards, smiled apologetically, and said, \"Please accept my \nprofound regrets, Mr. Capone. l'm sorry to report that the plan failed ... 1 \nfailed.\" \nCapone slowly stood up. He glowered at Lustig, debating which part \nof the river to throw hirn in. But the count reached into his coat pocket, \nwithdrew the $50,000, and placed it on the desk. \"Here, sir, is your money, \nto the penny. Again, my sincere apolog ies. This is most embarrassing. \nThings didn't work out the way 1 thought they would. 1 would have loved \nto have doubled your money for you and for myself-Lord knows 1 need \nit-but the plan just didn't materializ e.\" \nCapone sagged back into his chair, confused. \"I know you're a con \nman, Count, \" said Capone. \"I knew it the moment you walked in here. 1 \nexpected either one hundred thousand dollars or nothing. But this . .. get­\nting my money back ... well.\" \"Again my apolog ies, Mr. Capone,\" said \nLustig, as he picked up his hat and began to leave. \"My God! You're hon­\nest!\" yelled Capone. \"If you're on the spot, here's five to help you along.\" \nHe counted out five one-thousand-dollar bills out of the $50,000. The \ncount seemed stunned, bowed deeply, mumbled his thanks, and left, tak­\ning the money. \nThe $5,000 was what Lustig had been after all along. \nInterpretation \nCount Victor Lustig, a man who spoke several languages and prided him­\nself on his refinement and culture, was one of the great con artists of mod­\nem times. He was known for his audacity, his fearlessness, and, most \nimportant, his knowledge of human psychology. He could size up a man in \nminute s, discovering his wea knesses, and he had radar for sucke rs. Lustig \nknew that most men build up defenses against crooks and other trouble­\nmakers . The con artist's job is to bring those def enses down. \nOne sure way to do this is through an act of apparent sincerity and \nhonesty. Who will distrust a person literally caught in the act of being hon-\nest? Lustig used selective honesty many times, but with Capone he went a \nstep further. No normal con man would have dared such a con; he would \nhave chosen his suckers for their meekness, for that look about them that \nsays they will take their medicine without complaint. Con Capone and you \nwould spend the rest of your life (whatever remained of it) afraid. But \nLustig underst ood that a man like Capone spends his life rrlistrusting oth­\ners. No one around hirn is honest or generous, and being so much in the \ncompany of wolves is exhausting, even depressing. A man like Capone \nyearns to be the recipient of an honest or generous gesture, to feel that not \neveryone has an angle or is out to rob hirn. \nLustig's act of selective honesty disarmed Capone because it was so \nunexpected. A con artist loves conflicting emotions like these, since the \nperson caught up in them is so easily distracted and deceived. \nDo not shy away from practicing this law on the Capones of the world. \nWith a well-timed gesture of honesty or generosity, you will have the most \nbrutal and cynical beast in the kingdom eating out of your hand. \nEverything turns gray when I don 't have at least one mark on the horizon. \nLife then seems empty and depressing. I cannot understand honest men. \nThey lead desperate lives, full of boredom. \nCO/IIII \"ir/or j,nl/ig, /891J-/'N7 \nKEYS TO POWER \nThe essence of deception is distraction. Distracting the people you want to \ndeceive gives you the time and space to do something they won't notice, \nAn act of kind ness, generosity, or honesty is often the most powerful form \nof distraction because it disarms other people's suspicions, It turns them \ninto children, eagerly lapping up any kind of affectiona te gesture. \nIn ancient China this was called \"giving before you take\"-the giving \nmakes it hard for the other person to notice the taking. It is a device with \ninfinite practical uses. Brazenly taking something from someone is danger­\nous, even for the powerful. The victim will plot revenge , It is also danger­\nous simply to ask for what you need, no matter how politely: Unless the \nother person sees some gain for themselves, they may come to resent your \nneediness. Learn to give before you take. It softens the ground, takes the \nbite out of a future request, or simply creates a distraction. And the giving \ncan take many forms: an actual gift, a generous act, a kind favor, an \"hon­\nest\" admission-what ever it takes, \nSelective honesty is best employed on your first encounter with some­\none. We are all creatures of habit, and our first impressions last a long time. \nIf someone believes you are honest at the start of your relationship it takes \na lot to convince them otherw ise. This gives you room to maneuver . \nJay Gould, like Al Capone, was a man who distrusted everyone. \nBy the time he was thirty-three he was already a multimillionaire, \nmostly through deception and strong-arming. In the late 1860s, Gould in­\nvested heavily in the Erle Railroad, then discovered that the market had \nLAW 12 91 \n92 LAW 12 been flooded with a vast amount of phony stock certificates for the com­\npany. He stood to lose a fortune and to suff er a lot of embarr assment. \nIn the midst ofthis crlsis, a man named LordJohn Gordon-Gordon of­\nfered to help. Gordo n-Gordon, a Scottish lord, had apparendy made a \nsmall fortune investing in railroads. \nBy hirlng some handwriting experts · Gordon-Gordon was able to \nprove to Gould that the culprlts for the phony stock certificates were actu­\nally several top executives with the Erle Railroad itself. Gould was grateful. \nGordon-Gordon then proposed that he and Gould join forces to buy up a \ncontrolling int erest in Erle. Gould agre ed. For a while the venture ap­\npeared to prosper. The two men were now good friends, and every time \nGordon-Gordon came to Gould asking for money to buy more stock, \nGould gave it to him. In 1873, however, Gord on-Gordon suddenly \ndump ed all of his stock, making a fortune but drastically lowering the value \nof Gould's own holdings. Then he disappea red from sight. \nUpon investigation, Gould found out that Gord on-Gordon's real name \nwas John Crowning sfield, and that he was the bastard son of a merchant \nseaman and a London barmaid. There had been many clues before then \nthat Gordon-Gordon was a con man, but his initial act of honesty and sup­\nport had so blinded Gould that it took the loss of milli ons for hirn to see \nthrough the scheme. \nA single act of honesty is often not enough. What is required is a repu­\ntation for honesty, built on a serles of acts--but these can be quite inconse­\nquential. Once this reputation is esta blished, as with first impr essions, it is \nhard to shake. \nIn ancient China, Duke Wu of CMng decided it was time to take over \nthe increasingly powerful kingdom of Hu. Telling no one of his plan, he \nmar ried his daughter to Hu' s roler. He then called a council and asked his \nministers, \"I am considering a military campaign. Which country should \nwe invade ?\" As he had expected, one of his ministers replied, \"Hu should \nbe invade d.\" The duke seemed angry, and said, \"Hu is a sister state now. \nWhy do you suggest invadi ng her?\" He had the minister execute d for his \nimpolitic remark. The ruler of Hu heard about this, and consid erlng other \ntokens of W u's honesty and the marriage with his daughter, he took no pre­\ncautions to defend hirnself from Cheng. A few weeks later, Cheng forces \nswept through Hu and took the country, never to relinquish it. \nHonesty is one of the best ways to disarm the wary, but it is not the \nonly one. Any kind of noble, apparendy selfless act will serve. Perhaps the \nbest such act, though, is one of generosity. Few people can resist a gUt, even \nfrom the most hardened enemy, which is why it is often the perfect way to \ndisarm people. A gift brings out the child in us, instandy lowerlng our de­\nfenses. Although we often view other people's actions in the most cynical \nlight, we rarely see the Machiavellian element of a gift, which quite often \nhides ulterlor motive s. A gift is the perfect object in which to hide a decep­\ntive move. \nOver three thousand years ago the ancient Greeks traveled across the \nsea to recapture the beautiful Helen, stolen away from them by Paris, and \nto destroy Paris's city, Troy. The siege lasted ten years, many heroes died, \nyet neither side had come elose to victory. One day, the prophet Calchas \nassembled the Greeks. \n\"Stop battering away at these walls!\" he told them. \"You must find \nsome other way, some ruse. We cannot take \nTroy by force alone. We I mag e: T h e must find some cunning \nstratag ern.\" The cun- Trojan Horse. ning Greek leader \nOdysseus then came up Y 0 u r g u i lei s with the idea of building \na giant wooden horse, hidden inside hiding soldiers inside it, \nthen offering it to the a magnif icent Trojans as a gift. \nNeoptolemus, son of gift that proves Achilles, was disgusted \nwith this idea; it was irresistible to unma nly.

But the soldiers, faced \nwith a choice between Once inside, another ten years of \nmanlin ess, honor, and wreak havoc . death, on the one hand \nand a quick victory on the other, chose the \nhorse, which was promptly built. The trick was successful and Troy fell. \nOne gift did more for the Greek cause than ten years of fighting. \nSelective kindness should also be part of your arsenal of deception. For \nyears the ancient Romans had besieged the city of the Faliscans, always un­\nsuccessfully. One day, however, when the Roman general Camillus was \nencamped outside the city, he suddenly saw a man leading some children \ntoward hirn. The man was a Faliscan teacher, and the children, it turned \nout, were the sons and daughters of the noblest and wealthie st citizens of \nthe town. On the pretense of taking these chil dren out for a walk, he had \nled them straight to the Romans, offering them as hostages in hopes of in­\ngratiating hirnself with Camillus, the city's enemy. \nCamillus did not take the children hostage. He stripped the teacher, \ntied his hands behind his back, gave each child a rod, and let them whip \nhim all the way back to the city. The gesture had an immediate effect on \nthe Faliscans. Had Camillus used the children as hostages, some in the city \nwould have voted to surrender. And even if the Faliscans had gone on \nfighting, their resistance would have been halfhearte d. Camill us's refusal to \ntake advantage of the situation broke down the Faliscans' resistance, and \nthey surrendered. The general had calculated correctly. And in any case he \nhad had nothing to lose: He knew that the ho stage ploy would not have \nended the war, at least not right away. By tuming the situation around, he \nearned his enemy's trust and respect, disarming them. Selective kindness \nwill often break down even the most stubborn foe: Aiming right for the \nheart, it corrodes the will to fight back. \nRememb er: By playing on people's emotions, calculated acts of kind­\nness can turn a Capone into a gullible child. As with any emotional ap­\nproach, the tactic must be practiced with caution: If people see through it, \ntheir disappointed feelings of gratitude and warmth will become the most \nviolent hatred and distrust. Unless you can make the gesture seem sincere \nand heartfelt, do not play with fire. \nLAW 12 93 \n94 LAW 12 REVERS AL Authority: When Duke Hsien \nof Chin was about to raid Yü, \nhe presented to them a jade \nand a team of horses.

One of the most powerful families in the city, the Poggios, \nhad been instrumental in his climb (which succeeded through treachery \nand bloodshed), but after he came to power, they came to feel he had for­\ngotten them. His ambition outweighed any gratitude he feh. In 1325, while \nCastruccio was away fighting Lucca's main rival, Florence, the Poggios \nconspired with other noble families in the city to rid themselves of this \ntroublesome and ambitious prince. \nMounting an insurrection, the plotters attacked and murdered the gov­\nemor whom Castruccio had left behind to rule the city. Riots broke out, \nand the Castruccio supporters and the Poggio supporters were poised to do \nbattle. At the height of the tension, however, Stefano di Poggio, the oldest \nmember of the family, interv ened, and made both sides lay down their \narms. \nA peaceful man, Stefano had not taken part in the conspiracy. He had \ntold his family it would end in a useless bloodbath. Now he insisted he \nshould intercede on the family's behalf and persuade Castruccio to listen to \ntheir complaints and satisfy their demands. Stefano was the oldest and wis­\nest member of the clan, and his family agreed to put their trust in his diplo­\nmacy rather than in their weapons. \nWhen news of the rebellion reached Castruccio, he hurried back to \nLucca. By the time he arrived, however, the fighting had ceased, through \nStefano's agency, and he was surprised by the city's calm and peace. Ste­\nfano di Poggio had imagined that Castruccio would be grateful to him for \nhis part in quelling the rebellion, so he paid the prince a visit. He explained \nhow he had brought peace, then begged for Castr uccio's mercy. He said \nthat the rebels in his family were young and impetuous, hungry for power \nyet inexperienced; he recalled his farnily's past generosity to Castruccio. \nFor an these reasons, he said, the great prince should pardon the Poggios \nand listen to their complaints. This, he said, was the only just thing to do, \nsince the family had willingly laid down their arms and had always sup­\nported him. \nCastruccio listened patiently. He seemed not the slightest bit angry or \nresentful. Instead, he told Stefano to rest assured that justice would prevail, \nand he asked him to bring his entire family to the palace to talk over their \ngrievances and come to an agreement. As they took leave of one another, \nCastruccio said he thanked God for the chance he had been given to show \nhis clemency and kindness. That evening the entire Poggio family came to \nthe palace. Castruccio immediately had them imprisoned and a few days \nlater all were executed, including Stefano. \nInterpretation \nStefano di Poggio is the embodiment of all those who believe that the jus­\ntice and nobility of their cause will prevail. Certainly appeals to justice and \ngratitude have occasionally succeeded in the past, but more often than not \nthey have had dire consequence s, especially in dealings with the Castruc­\ncios of the world. Stefano knew that the prince had risen to power through \ntreachery and ruthlessness. This was a man, after all, who had put a elose \nand devoted friend to death. When Castruccio was told that it had been a \nterrible wrong to kill such an old friend, he replied that he had executed \nnot an old friend but a new enemy. \nA man like Castruccio knows only force and self-interest. When the re­\nbellion began, to end it and place oneself at his mercy was the most dan­\ngerous possible move. Even once Stefano di Poggio had made that fatal \nmistake, however, he still had options: He could have offered money to \nCastruccio, could have made promises for the future, could have pointed \nout what the Poggios could still contribute to Castruccio's power-their in­\nfluence with the most influential families of Rome, for example, and the \ngreat marriage they could have brokered. \nInstead Stefano brought up the past, and debts that carried no obliga­\ntion. Not only is a man not obliged to be grateful, gratitude is often a terri­\nble burden that he gladly discards. And in this case Castruccio rid himself \nofhis obligations to the Poggios by eliminating the Poggios. \nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW \nIn 433 B.C., just before the Peloponnesian War, the island of Corcyra (later \ncalled Corfu) and the Greek city-state of Corinth stood on the brink of con­\nflict. Both parties sent ambassadors to Athens to try to win over the Atheni­\nans to their side. The stakes were high, since whoever had Athens on his \nside was sure to win. And whoever won the war would certainly give the \ndefeated side no mercy. \nCorcyra spoke first. Its ambassador began by admitting that the island \nhad never helped Athens before, and in fact had allied itself with Athens's \nenemies. There were no ties of friendship or gratitude between Corcyra \nand Athens. Yes, the ambassador admitted, he had come to Athens now \nout of fear and concern for Corcyra' s safety. The only thing he could offer \nwas an alliance of mutual interests. Corcyra had a navy only surpassed in \nsize and strength by Athens's own; an alliance between the two states \nwould create a formidable force, one that could intimidate the riyal state of \nSparta. That, unfortunately, was all Corcyra had to offer. \nThe represen tative from Corinth then gave a brilliant, passionate \nspeech, in sharp contrast to the dry, colorless approach of the Corcyran. \nHe talked of everything Corinth had done for Athens in the past. He asked \nhow it would look to Athens's other allies if the city put an agreement with \na former enemy over one with a present friend, one that had served \nAthens's interest loyally: Perhaps those allies would break their agreements \nwith Athens if they saw that their loyalty was not valued. He referred to \nHellenic law, and the need to repay Corinth for all its good deeds. He fi­\nnally went on to list the many services Corinth had performed for Athens, \nand the importance of showing gratitude to one's friends. \nAfter the speech, the Athenians debated the issue in an assembly. On Most men are so thor· \noughly subjective that \nnothing real/y interests \nthem but themselves. \nThey always think of \ntheir own case as soon \nas ever any remark is \nmade, and their whole \nattention is engrossed \nand absorbed by the \nmerest chance refer­\nence to anything which \naffects them persona /ly, \nbe it never so remote. \nARTHUR \nSCHOPENHAUER, \n1788-1860 \nLAW 13 97 \n98 LAW 13 the second round, they voted overwhelmingly to ally with Corcyra and \ndrop Corinth. \nInterpretation \nHistory has remembered the Athenians nobly, but they were the preemi­\nnent realists of classical Greece. With them, all the rhetoric, all the emo­\ntional appeals in the world, could not match a good pragmatic argument, \nespecially one that added to their power. \nWhat the Corinthian ambassador did not realize was that his refer­\nences to Corinth's past generosity to Athens only irritated the Athenians, \nsubtly asking them to feel guilty and putting them under obligation. The \nAthenians couldn't care less about past favors and friendly feelings. At the \nsame time, they knew that if their other allies thought them ungrateful for \nabandoning Corinth, these city-states would still be unlikely to break their \nties to Athens, the preeminent power in Greece. Athens ruled its empire by \nforce, and would simply compel any rebellious ally to return to the fold. \nWhen people choose between talk about the past and talk about the \nfuture, a pragmatic person will always opt for the future and forget the past. \nAs the Corcyrans realized, it is always best to speak pragmatically to a \npragmatic person. And in the end, most people are in fact pragmatic-they \nwill rarely act against their own self-interest. \nIt has always been a ruZe that the weak should be subject to the strong; \nand besides, we consider that we are worthy of our power. Up tilZ the \npresent moment you, too, used to think that we were; but now, after \ncalculating your own interest, you are beginning to talk in terms of right \nand wrong. Considerations of this kind have never yet turned people aside \nfrom the opportunities of aggrandizement offered by superior strength. \nAthenian repres entative to Sparta, \nquoted in The Pelo ponnesia n War, Thucydides, c. 465-39 5 B.r;. \nKEYS TO POWER \nIn your quest for power, you will constantly find yourself in the position of \nasking for help from those more powerful than you. There is an art to ask­\ning for help, an art that depends on your ability to understand the person \nyou are dealing with, and to not confuse your needs with theirs. \nMost people never succeed at this, because they are completely \ntrapped in their own wants and desires. They start from the assumption \nthat the people they are appealing to have a selfless interest in helping \nthem. They talk as if their needs mattered to these people--who probably \ncouldn't care less. Sometimes they refer to larger issues: a great cause, or \ngrand emotions such as love and gratitude. They go for the big picture \nwhen simple, everyday realities would have much more appeal. What they \ndo not realize is that even the most powerful person is locked inside needs \nof his own, and that if you make no appeal to his self-interest, he merely \nsees you as desperate or, at best, a waste of time. \nIn the sixteenth century, Portuguese missionaries tried for years to con­\nvert the people of Japan to Cathol icism, while at the same time Portugal \nhad a monopoly on trade between Japan and Europe. Although the mis­\nsionaries did have some success, they never got far among the ruling elite; \nby the beginning of the seventeenth century, in fact, their proselytizing had \ncompletely antagonized the Japanese emperor Ieyasu. When the Dutch \nbegan to arrive in Japan in great numbers, Ieyasu was much relieved. He \nneeded Europeans for their know-how in guns and navig ation, and here at \nlast were Europeans who cared nothing for spreading religion -the Dutch \nwanted only to trade. Ieyasu swiftly moved to evict the Portugu ese. From \nthen on, he would only deal with the practical-minded Dutch. \nJapan and Holland were vastly different cultures, but each shared a \ntimeless and universal concern: self-interest. Every person you deal with is \nlike another culture, an alien land with a past that has nothing to do with \nyours. Yet you can bypass the differences between you and hirn by appeal­\ning to his self-interest. Do not be subtle: You have valua ble knowledge to \nshare, you will fill his coffers with gold, you will make hirn live longer and \nhappier. This is a language that all of us speak and understand. \nA key step in the process is to und erstand the other person's psychol­\nogy. Is he vain? Is he concerned about his reputation or his social standing? \nDoes he have enemies you could help hirn vanquish ? Is he simply moti­\nvated by money and power? \nWhen the MongoIs invaded China in the twelfth century, they threat­\nened to obliterate a culture that had thrived for over two thousand years. \nTheir leader, Genghis Khan, saw nothing in China but a country that \nlacked pasturing for his horses, and he decided to destroy the place, level­\ning all its cities, for \"it would be better to exterminate the Chinese and let \nthe grass grow.\" It was not a soldier, a general , or a king who saved the \nChinese from devastation, but a man named Yelu Ch'u-Ts'ai. A foreigner \nhirnself, Ch'u-Ts'ai had come to appreciate the superiority of Chinese cul­\nture. He managed to make hirnself a trusted adviser to Genghis Khan, and \npersuaded hirn that he would reap rich es out of the place if, instead of de­\nstroying it, he simply taxed everyone who lived there. Khan saw the wis­\ndom in this and did as Ch'u-Ts'ai advised. \nWhen Khan took the city of Kaifeng, after a long siege, and decided to \nmassacre its inhabitants (as he had in other cities that had resisted hirn), \nCh'u-Ts'ai told hirn that the finest craftsmen and engineers in China had \nfled to Kaifeng, and it would be better to put them to use. Kaifeng was \nspared. Never before had Genghis Khan shown such mercy, but then it \nreally wasn't mercy that saved Kaifeng. Ch'u-Ts'ai knew Khan weIl. He was \na barbaric peasant who cared nothing for culture, or indeed for anything \nother than warf are and practical results. Ch'u-Ts'ai chose to appeal to the \nonly emotion that would work on such a man: greed. \nSelf-interest is the lever that will move people. Once you make them \nsee how you can in some way meet their needs or advance their cause, \ntheir resistance to your requests for help will magically fall away. At each \nstep on the way to acquiring power, you must train yourself to think your \nLAW 13 99 \n100 LAW 13 way inside the other person's mind, to see their needs and interests, to get \nrid of the screen of your own feelings that obscure the truth. Master this art \nand there will be no limits to what you can accomplish. \nImage: A Cord that \nBinds. The cord of \nmercy and grati­\ntude is threadbare, \nand will break at \nthe first shock. \nDo not throw \nsuch a lifeline. \nThe cord of \nmutual self-inter­\nest is woven of \nmany fibers and \ncannot easily be \nsevered. It will serve \nyou weH for years. \nAuthority: The shortest and best way to make your for­\ntune is to let people see clearly that it is in their interests \nto promote yours. (Jean de La Bruyere, 1645-1696) \nREVERSAL \nSome people will see an appeal to their self-interest as ugly and ig noble. \nThey actually prefer to be able to exercise charity, mercy, and justice, \nwhich are their ways of feeling superior to you: When you beg them for \nhelp, you emphasize their power and position. They are strang enough to \nneed nothing from you except the chance to feel superior. This is the wine \nthat intoxicates them. They are dying to fund your project, to introduce \nyou to powerful people-provided, of course, that all this is done in public, \nand for a good cause (usually the more public, the better). Not everyone, \nthen, can be approached through cynical self-interest. Same people will be \nput off by it, because they don't want to seem to be motivated by such \nthings. They need opportunities to display their good he art. \nDa not be shy. Give them that opporttinity. It's not as if you are con­\nning them by asking for help-it is really their pleasure to give, and to be \nseen giving. You must distinguish the differences among powerful people \nand figure out what makes them tick. When they ooze greed, da not appeal \nto their charity. When they want to look charitable and noble, da not ap­\npeal to their greed. \nLAW \n14 \nPO SE AS A FRIE ND , \nWO RK AS A SPY \nJUDGMENT \nKnowing about your rival is critical.

There is no occa­\nsion that is not an opportunity for artful spying. \n101 \n102 LAW 14 OBSER VANCE OF THE LAW \nJoseph Duveen was undoubtedly the greatest art dealer of his time-from \n1904 to 1940 he almost single-handedly monopolized America's million­\naire art-collecting market. But one prize plum eluded hirn: the industrialist \nAndrew Mellon. Before he died, Duveen was determined to make Mellon \na dient. \nDuveen's friends said this was an impossible dream. Mellon was a stiff, \ntacitum man. The stories he had heard about the congenial, talkative Du­\nveen rubbed hirn the wrong way-he had made it dear he had no desire to \nmeet the man. Yet Duveen told his doubting friends, \"Not only will Mellon \nbuy from me but he will buy only from me.\" For several years he tracked \nhis prey, leaming the man's habits, tastes, phobias. To do this, he secretly \nput several of Mellon's staff on his own payroll, worming valuable informa­\ntion out of them. By the time he moved into action, he knew Mellon about \nas well as Mellon's wife did. \nIn 1921 Mellon was visiting London, and staying in a palatial suite on \nthe third floor of Claridge's Hotel. Duveen booked hirnself into the suite \njust below Mellon's, on the second floor. He had arranged for his valet to \nbefriend Mellon's valet, and on the fateful day he had chosen to make his \nmove, Mellon's valet told Duveen's valet, who told Duveen, that he had \njust helped Mellon on with his overcoat, and that the industrialist was mak­\ning his way down the corridor to ring for the lift. \nDuveen's valet hurriedly helped Duveen with his own overcoat. Sec­\nonds later, Duveen entered the lift, and 10 and behold, there was Mellon. \n\"How do you do, Mr. Mellon?\" said Duveen, introducing hirnself. \"I am on \nmy way to the National Gallery to look at some pictures.\" How uncanny­\nthat was precisely where Mellon was headed. And so Duveen was able to \naccompany his prey to the one location that would ensure his success. He \nknew Mellon's taste inside and out, and while the two men wandered \nthrough the museum, he dazzled the magnate with his knowledge . Once \nagain quite uncannily, they seemed to have remarkably similar tastes. \nMellon was pleasantly surprised: This was not the Duveen he had ex­\npected. The man was charming and agreeable, and dearly had exquisite \ntaste. When they retumed to New York, Mellon visited Duveen's exdusive \ngallery and fell in love with the collection. Everything, surprisingly enough, \nseemed to be precisely the kind of work he wanted to collect. For the rest \nof his life he was Duveen's best and most generous dient. \nInterpretation \nA man as ambitious and competitive as Joseph Duveen left nothing to \nchance. What's the point of winging it, of just hoping you may be able to \ncharm this or that dient? It's like shooting ducks blindfolded. Arm yourself \nwith a little knowledge and your aim improves. \nMellon was the most spectacular of Duveen's catches, but he spied on \nmany a millionaire . By secretly putting members of his clients' household \nstaffs on his own payroll, he would gain constant access to valuable infor-\nmation about their masters' comings and goings, changes in taste, and \nother such tidbits of information that would put hirn a step ahead. A riyal \nof Duveen's who wanted to make Henry Frick a dient noticed that when­\never he visited this wealthy New Yorker, Duveen was there before hirn, as \nif he had a sixth sense. To other dealers Duveen seemed to be everywhere, \nand to know everything before they did. His powers discouraged and dis­\nheartened them, until many simply gave up going after the wealthy dients \nwho could make a dealer rich. \nSuch is the power of artful spying: It makes you seem all-powerful, \nclairvoyant. Your knowledge of your mark can also make you seem charm­\ning, so well can you anticipate his desires. No one sees the source of your \npower, and what they cannot see they cannot fight. \nRulers see through spies, as cows through smell, Brahmins through \nscriptures and the rest 01 the people through their normal eyes. \nKautilya, Indian philosopher, third antury B.C. \nKEYS TO POWER \nIn the realm of power, your goal is a degree of control over future events. \nPart of the problem you face, then, is that people won't tell you all their \nthoughts, emotions, and plans. Controlling what they say, they often keep \nthe most critical parts of their character hidden-their weaknesses, ulterior \nmotives, obsessions. The result is that you cannot predict their moves, and \nare constantly in the dark. The trick is to find a way to probe them, to find \nout their secrets and hidden intentions, without letting them know what \nyou are up to. \nThis is not as difficult as you might think. A friendly front will let you \nsecretly gather information on friends and enemies alike . Let others con­\nsult the horoscope, or read tarot cards: You have more concrete me ans of \nseeing into the future. \nThe most common way of spying is to use other people, as Duveen \ndid. The method is simple, powerful, but risky: You will certainly gather in­\nformation, but you have little control over the people who are doing the \nwork. Perhaps they will ineptly reveal your spying, or even secretly turn \nagainst you. It is far better to be the spy yourself, to pose as a friend while \nsecretly gathering information. \nThe French politician Talleyrand was one of the greatest practitioners \nof this art. He had an uncanny ability to worm secrets out of people in po­\nlite conversation. A contemporary of his, Baron de Vitrolles, wrote, \"Wit \nand grace marked his conversation. He possessed the art of concealing his \nthoughts or his malice beneath a transparent veil of insinuations, words \nthat imply something more than they express. Only when necessary did he \ninject his own personality.\" The key here is Talleyrand's ability to suppress \nhimself in the conversation, to make others talk endlessly about themselves \nand inadvertently reveal their intentions and plans. \nLAW 14 103 \nIf you have reason to \nsuspect that a person is \ntelling you a lie, look as \nthough you believed \nevery word he said. \nThis will give him \ncourage to go on; he \nwill hecome more \nvehement in his \nassertions , and in the \nend betray himself \nAgain, ifyou perceive \nthat a person is trying \nto conceal something \nfrom you, but with only \npartial success, look as \nthough you did not \nbelieve him. The oppo­\nsition on your part will \nprovoke him into lead-\ning out his reserve of \ntYUth and bringing the \nwhole force of it to \nhear upon your \nincredulity. \nARTHUR \nSnlOPFNIIAUER, \n171l8-1 860 \n104 LAW 14 Throughout Talleyrand's life, people said he was a superb conversa­\ntionalist-yet he actually said very litde. He never talked about his own \nideas; he got others to reveal theirs. He would organize friendly games of \ncharades for foreign diplomats, social gatherings where, however, he \nwould carefully weigh their words, cajole confidences out of them, and \ngather information invaluable to his work as France's foreign minister. At \nthe Congress of Vienna (1814-1815) he did his spying in other ways: He \nwould blurt out what seemed to be a secret (actually something he had \nmade up), then watch his listeners' reactions. He might tell a gathering of \ndiplomats, for instance, that a reliable source had revealed to him that the \nczar of Russia was planning to arrest his top general for treason. By watch­\ning the diplomats' reactions to this made-up story, he would know which \nones were most excited by the weakening of the Russian army-perhaps \ntheir goverments had designs on Russia? As Baron von Stetten said, \n\"Monsieur Talleyrand fires a pistol into the air to see who will jump out the \nwindow.\" \nDuring social gatherings and innocuous encounters, pay attention. \nThis is when people's guards are down. By suppressing your own personal­\nity, you can make them reveal things. The brilliance of the maneuver is \nthat they will mistake your interest in them for friendship, so that you not \nonly leam, you make allies. \nNevertheless, you should practice this tactic with caution and care. If \npeople begin to suspect you are worming secrets out of them under the \ncover of conversation, they will stricdy avoid you. Emphasize friendly \nchatter, not valuable information. Your search for gems of information can­\nnot be too obvious, or your probing questions will reveal more about your­\nself and your intentions than about the information you hope to find. \nA trick to try in spying comes from La Rochefoucauld, who wrote, \n\"Sincerity is found in very few men, and is often the cleverest of ruses-­\none is sincere in order to draw out the confidence and secrets of the other.\" \nBy pretending to bare your heart to another person, in other words, you \nmake them more likely to reveal their own secrets. Give them a fals� con­\nfession and they will give you areal one. Another trick was identified by \nthe philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who suggested vehemendy contra­\ndicting people you're in conversa tion with as a way of irritating them, stir­\nring them up so that they lose some of the control over their words. In their \nemotional re action they will reveal all kinds of truths about themselves, \ntruths you can later use against them. \nAnother method of indirect spying is to test people, to lay litde traps \nthat make them reveal things about themselves. Chosroes 11, a notoriously \nclever seventh-c entury king of the Persians, had many ways of seeing \nthrough his subjects without raising suspicion. If he noticed, for instance, \nthat two of his courtiers had become particularly friendly, he would call \none of them aside and say he had information that the other was a traitor, \nand would soon be killed. The king would tell the courtier he trusted him \nmore than anyone, and that he must keep this information secret. Then he \nwould watch the two men carefully. If he saw that the second courtier had \nnot changed in his behavior toward the king, he would conclude that the \nfirst courtier had kept the secret, and he would quickly promote the man, \nlater taking hirn aside to confess, \"I meant to kill your friend because of \ncertain information that had reached me, but, when 1 investigated the mat­\nter, 1 found it was untrue.\" If, on the other hand, the second courtier started \nto avoid the king, acting aloof and tense, Chosroes would know that the se­\ncret had been revealed. He would ban the second courtier from his court, \nletting hirn know that the whole business had only been a test, but that \neven though the man had done nothing wrong, he could no longer trust \nhirn. The first courtier, however, had revealed a secret, and hirn Chosroes \nwould ban from his entire kingdom. \nIt may seem an odd form of spying that reveals not empirical informa­\ntion but a person's character. Often, however, it is the best way of solving \nproblems before they arise. \nBy tempting people into certain acts, you leam about their loyalty, \ntheir honesty, and so on. And this kind of knowledge is often the most \nvaluable of all: Armed with it, you can predict their actions in the future. \nImage: \nThe Third Eye of \nthe Spy. In the land of \nthe two-eyed, the third eye \ngives you the omniscience \nof a god. You see further than \nothers, and you see deeper \ninto thern. Nobody is \nsafe from the eye \nbut you. \nAuthority: Now, the reason a brilliant sovereign and a wise general \nconquer the enerny whenever they move, and their achievements \nsurpass those of ordinary men, is their foreknowledge of the enemy \nsituation. This \"foreknowledge\" cannot be elicited from spirits, nor \nfrom gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor by astrologie calcu­\nlations. It must be obtained from men who know the enemy sit­\nuation-f rom spies. (Sun-tzu, The Art 0/ War, fourth century B.C.) \nLAW 14 105 \n106 LAW 14 REVERSAL \nInformation is critical to power, but just as you spy on other people, you \nmust be prepared for them to spy on you. One of the most potent weapons \nin the battle for information, then, is giving out false information. As Win­\nston Churchill said, \"Truth is so precious that she should always be at­\ntended by a bodyguard of lies.\" You must surround YOUTself with such a \nbodyguard, so that YOUT truth cannot be penetrated. By planting the infor­\nmation of YOUT choice, you control the game. \nIn 1944 the Nazis' rocket-bomb attacks on London suddenly escalated. \nOver two thousand V-I flying bombs fell on the city, killing more than five \nthousand people and wounding many more. Somehow, however, the Ger­\nmans consistently missed their targets. Bombs that were intended for \nTower Bridge, or Piccadilly, would fall weIl short of the city, landing in the \nless populated suburbs. This was because, in fixing their targets, the Ger­\nmans relied on secret agents they had plan ted in England. They did not \nknow that these agents had been discovered, and that in their place, \nEnglish-controlled agents were feeding them subtly deceptive information. \nThe bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every time \nthey fell. By the end of the campaign they were landing on cows in the \ncountry. By feeding people wrong information, then, you gain a potent ad­\nvantage. While spying gives you a third eye, disinformation puts out one of \nyour enemy's eyes. A cyclops, he always misses his target. \nLAW \n15 \nCR USH YO UR \nENE MY TOT ALL Y \nJUDGMENT \nAll great leaders since Moses have known that a feared \nenemy must be crushed completely.

These two generals began their \ncareers as friends, fighting on the same side. Hsiang Yu came from the no­\nbility; large and powerful, given to bouts of violence and temper, a bit dull­\nwitted, he was yet a mighty warrior who always fought at the head of his \ntroops. Liu Pang came from peasant stock. He had never been much of a \nsoldier, and preferred women and wine to fighting; in fact, he was some­\nthing of a scoundrel. But he was wily, and he had the ability to recognize \nthe best strategists, keep them as his advisers, and listen to their advice. He \nhad risen in the army through these strengths. \nIn 208 B.C., the king of Ch'u sent two massive armies to conquer the \npowerful kingdom of Ch'in. One army went north, under the generalship \nof Sung Yi, with Hsiang Yu second in comma nd; the other, led by Liu \nPang, headed straight toward Ch'in. The target was the kingdom's splendid \ncapital, Hsien-yang. And Hsiang Yu, ever violent and impatient, could not \nstand the idea that Liu Pang would get to Hsien-yang first, and perhaps \nwould assurne command of the entire army. \nAt one point on the northem front, Hsiang' s commander, Sung Yi, \nhesitated in sending his troops into battle. Furious, Hsiang entered Sung \nYi's tent, proclaimed hirn a traitor, cut off his head, and assumed sole com­\nmand of the army. Without waiting for orders, he left the northem front \nand marched directly on Hsien-yang. He feit certain he was the better sol­\ndier and general than Liu, but, to his utter astonishment, his riyal, leading a \nsmaller, swifter army, manage d to reach Hsien-yang first. Hsiang had an \nadviser, Fan Tseng, who wamed him, \"This village headman [Liu Pang] \nused to be greedy only for riches and women, but since entering the capital \nhe has not been led astray by wealth, wine, or sex. That shows he is aiming \nhigh.\" \nFan Tseng urged Hsiang to kill his riyal before it was too late. He told \nthe general to invite the wily pe asant to a banquet at their camp outside \nHsien-yang, and, in the midst of a celebratory sword dance, to have his \nhead cut off. The invitation was sent; Liu fell for the trap, and came to the \nbanquet. But Hsiang hesitated in ordering the sword dance, and by the \ntime he gave the signal, Liu had sensed a trap, and managed to escape. \n\"Bah!\" cried Fan Tseng in disgust, seeing that Hsiang had botched the plot. \n\"One cannot plan with a simplet on. Liu Pang will steal your empire yet \nand make us all his prisoners.\" \nRealizing his mistake, Hsiang hurriedly marched on Hsien-yang, this \ntime determined to hack off his rival's head. Liu was never one to fight \nwhen the odds were against hirn, and he abandoned the city. Hsiang cap­\ntured Hsien-yang, murdered the young prince of Ch'in, and bumed the \ncity to the ground. Liu was now Hsiang's bitter enemy, and he pursued \nhirn for many months, finally comering hirn in a walled city. Lacking food, \nhis army in disarray, Liu sued for peace. \nAgain Fan Tseng wamed Hsiang, \"Crush hirn now! If you let hirn go \nagain, you will be sorry later.\" But Hsiang decided to be merciful . He \nwanted to bring Liu back to Ch'u alive, and to force his former friend to ac­\nknowledge hirn as master. But Fan proved right: Liu managed to use the \nnegotiati ons for his surrender as a distraction, and he escaped with a small \narmy. Hsiang, amazed that he had yet again let his riyal slip away, once \nmore set out after Liu, this time with such ferocity that he seemed to have \nlost his mind. At one point, having captured Liu's father in battle, Hsiang \nstood the old man up during the fighting and yelled to Liu across the line of \ntroops, \"Surrender now, or 1 shall boi! your father alive !\" Liu calmly an­\nswered, \"But we are sworn brothers. So my father is your father also. If you \ninsist on boiling your own father, send me a bowl of the soup!\" Hsiang \nbacked down, and the struggle continued. \nA few weeks later, in the thick of the hunt, Hsiang scattered his forces \nunwisely, and in a surprise attack Liu was able to surround his main garri­\nson. For the first time the tables were turned. Now it was Hsiang who sued \nfor peace. Liu's top adviser urged hirn to destroy Hsiang, crush his army, \nshow no mercy. \"To let hirn go would be like rearing a tiger-it will devour \nyou later,\" the adviser said. Liu agreed. \nMaking a false treaty, he lured Hsiang into relaxing his defense, then \nslaughtered almost all of his army. Hsiang managed to escape. Alone and \non foot, knowing that Liu had put a bounty on his head, he came upon a \nsmall group of his own retreating soldiers, and cried out, \"I hear Liu Pang \nhas offered one thousand pieces of gold and a fief of ten thousand families \nfor my head. Let me do you a favor.\" Then he slit his own throat and died. \nInterpretation \nHsiang Yu had proven his ruthlessness on many an occasion. He rarely \nhesitated in doing away with a riyal if it served his purposes. But with Liu \nPang he acted differently. He respected his rival, and did not want to defeat \nhirn through deception; he wanted to prove his superiority on the battle­\nfield, even to force the clever Liu to surrender and to serve hirn. Every time \nhe had his riYal in his hands, something made hirn hesitate-a fatal sympa­\nthy with or respect for the man who, after all, had once been a friend and \ncomrade in arms. But the moment Hsiang made it clear that he intended to \ndo away with Liu, yet failed to accomplish it, he sealed his own doom. Liu \nwould not suffer the same hesitation on ce the tables were turned. \nThis is the fate that faces all of us when we sympathize with our ene­\nmies, when pity, or the hope of reconciliation, makes us pull back from \ndoing away with them. We only strengthen their fear and hatred of uso We \nhave beaten them, and they are humili ated; yet we nurture these resentful \nvipers who will one day kill uso Power cannot be dealt with this way. It \nmust be extermin ated, crushed, and denied the chance to return to haunt \nuso This is all the truer with a former friend who has become an enemy. \nThe law governing fatal antagonisms reads: Reconciliation is out of the \nquestion. Only one side can win, and it must win totally. \nLiu Pang learned this lesson weIl. After defeating Hsiang Yu, this son condottieri wanted to \nhear. On ce he reached \nSinigaglia.

Wu's beauty and forceful charac­\nter quickly won her this battle, but, knowing that an emperor, like other \npowerful men, is a creature of whim, and that she could easily be replaced, \nshe kept her eye on the future. \nWu managed to seduce the emperor' s dissolute son, Kao Tsung, on the \nonly possible occasion when she could find him alone: while he was reliev­\ning himself at the royal urinal. Even so, when the emperor died and Kao \nTsung took over the throne, she still suffered the fate to which all wives and \nconcubines of a deceased emperor were bound by tradition and law: Her \nhead shaven, she entered a convent, for what was supposed to be the rest \nof her life. For seven years Wu schemed to escape. By communicating in \nsecret with the new emperor, and by befriending his wife, the empress, she \nmanaged to get a highly unusual royal edict allowing her to return to the \npalace and to the royal harem. Once there, she fawned on the empress, \nwhile still sleeping with the emperor. The empress did not discourage \nthis-she had yet to provide the emperor with an heir, her position was \nvulnerable, and Wu was a valuable ally. \nIn 654 Wu Chao gave birth to a child. One day the empress came to \nvisit, and as so on as she had left, Wu smothered the newborn-her own \nbaby. When the murder was discovered, suspicion immediately fell on the \nempress, who had been on the scene moments earlier, and whose jealous \nnature was known by all. This was precisely Wu's plan. Shortly therea fter, \nthe empress was charged with murder and executed. Wu Chao was \ncrowned empress in her place. Her new husband, addicted to his life of \npleasure, gladly gave up the reins of govemment to Wu Chao, who was \nfrom then on known as Empress Wu. \nAlthough now in a position of great power, Wu hardly feh secure. \nThere were enemies everywhere; she could not let down her guard for one \nmoment. Indeed, when she was forty-one, she began to fear that her beau­\ntiful young niece was becoming the emperor's favorite. She poisoned the \nwoman with a day mixed into her food. In 675 her own son, touted as the \nheir apparent, was poisoned as weIl. The next-eldest son-illegitimate, but \nnow the crown prince-was exiled a little later on trumped-up charges. \nAnd when the emperor died, in 683, Wu managed to have the son after \nthat declared unfit for the throne. All this meant that it was her youngest, \nmost ineffectual son who finallybecame emperor. In this way she contin­\nued to rule. \nOver the next five years there were innumerable palace coups. All of \nthem failed, and all of the conspirators were executed. By 688 there was no \none left to challenge Wu. She proclaimed herself a divine descendant of \nBuddha, and in 690 her wishes were finally granted: She was named Holy \nand Divine \"Emperor\" of China. \nWu became emperor because there was literally nobody left from the \nprevious T'ang dynasty. And so she ruled unchallenged, for over a decade \nofrelative peace. In 705, at the age of eighty, she was forced to abdicate. \nInterpretation \nAll who knew Empress Wu remarked on her energy and intelligen ce. At \nthe time, there was no glory available for an ambitious woman beyond a \nfew years in the imperial harem, then a lifetime walled up in a convent. In \nWu's gradual but remarkable rise to the top, she was never naive. She \nknew that any hesitation, any momentary weakness, would speIl her end. \nIf, every time she got rid of a riyal a new one appeared, the solution was \nsimple: She had to crush them all or be killed herself. Other emperors be­\nfore her had followed the same path to the top, but Wu-who, as a woman, \nhad next to no chance to gain power-had to be more ruthless still. \nEmpress Wu's forty-year reign was one of the longest in Chinese his­\ntory. Although the story of her bloody rise to power is weIl known, in \nChina she is considered one ofthe period's most able and effective rulers. \nA priest asked the dying Spanish statesman and general Ram6n Maria Narvaez \n(1800-1868), \"Does your Exceltenc y forgive alt your enemies ?\" \"[ do not \nhave to forgive my enemies, \" answe red Narvaez, \"[ have had them alt shot. \" \nKEYS TO POWER \nIt is no accident that the two stories illustrating this law come from China: \nChinese history abounds with examples of enemies who were left alive and \nretumed to haunt the lenient. \"Crush the enemy\" is a key strategie tenet of \nSun-tzu, the fourth-century-B .c. author of The Art ofWar. The idea is simple: \nYour enemies wish you ill. There is nothing they want more than to elimi­\nnate you. If, in your struggles with them, you stop halfway or even three \nquarters of the way, out of mercy or hope of reconciliat ion, you only make \nthem more determined, more embittered, and they will someday take re­\nvenge. They may act friendly for the time being, but this is only because \nyou have defeated them. They have no choice but to bide their time. \nThe solution: Have no mercy. Crush your enemies as totally as they \nLAW 15 111 \n112 LAW 15 would crush you. Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for \nfrom your enemies is their disappeara nce. \nMao Tse-tung, a devoted reader of Sun-tzu and of Chinese history gen­\nerally, knew the importance of this law. In 1934 the Communist leader and \nsome 75,000 poorly equipped soldiers fled into the desolate mountains of \nwestern China to escape Chiang Kai- shek's much larger army, in what has \nsince been called the Long March. \nChiang was determined to eliminate every last Communist, and by a \nfew years later Mao had less than 10,000 soldiers left. By 1937, in fact, \nwhen China was invaded by Japan, Chiang calculated that the Commu­\nnists were no longer a threat. He chose to give up the ehase and concen­\ntrate on the Japanese. Ten years later the Communists had recovered \nenough to rout Chiang's army. Chiang had forgotten the ancient wisdom of \nerushing the enemy; Mao had not. Chiang was pursued until he and his en­\ntire army fled to the island of Taiwan. Nothing remains of his regime in \nmainland China to this day. \nThe wisdom behind \"crushing the enemy\" is as ancient as the Bible: \nIts first praetitioner may have been Moses, who learned it from God Him­\nself, when He parted the Red Sea for the Jews, then let the water flow back \nover the pursuing Egyptians so that \"not so much as one of them re­\nmained.\" When Moses returned from Mount Sinai with the Ten Com­\nmandments and found his people worshipping the Golden Calf, he had \nevery last offender slaug htered. And just before he died, he told his follow­\ners, finally about to enter the Promised Land, that when they had defeated \nthe tribes of Canaan they should \"utterly destroy them . . . make no \neovenant with them, and show no merey to them.\" \nThe goal of total victory is an axiom of modem warfare, and was codi­\nfied as such by Carl von Clausewitz, the premier philosopher of war. Ana­\nlyzing the campaigns of Napoleon, von Clausewitz wrote, \"We do claim \nthat direct annihilation of the enemy's forees must always be the dominant \nconsideration .... Onee a major victory is achieved there must be no talk of \nrest, of breathing space . . . but only of the pursuit, going for the enemy \nagain, seizing his eapital, attacking his reserves and anything else that \nmight give his country aid and eomfort.\" The reason for this is that after \nwar come negotiation and the division of territory. If you have only won a \npartial victory, you will inevitably lose in negotiation what you have \ngained by war. \nThe solution is simple: Allow your enemies no options. Annihilate \nthem and their territory is yours to carve. The goal of power is to control \nyour enemies completely, to make them obey your will. You cannot afford \nto go halfway. If they have no options, they will be forced to do your bid­\nding. This law has applieations far beyond the battlefield. Negotiation is the \ninsidious viper that will eat away at your vietory, so give your enemies \nnothing to negotiate, no hope, no room to maneuver. They are crushed \nand that is that. \nRealize this: In your struggle for power you will stir up rivalries and \ncreate enemies. There will be people you cannot win over, who will re­\nmain your enemies no matter what. But whatever wound you inflicted on \nthem, deliberately or not, do not take their hatred personally. Just recog­\nnize that there is no possibility of peace between you, especially as long as \nyou stay in power. If you let them stick around, they will seek revenge, as \ncertainly as night follows day. To wait for them to show their cards is just \nsilly; as Empress Wu understood, by then it will be too late. \nBe realistic: With an enemy like this around, you will never be secure. \nRemember the lessons of history, and the wisdom of Moses and Mao: \nNever go halfway. \nIt is not, of course, a question of murder, it is a question of banishment. \nSufficiently weakened and then exiled from your court forever, your ene­\nmies are rendered harmless. They have no hope of recovering, insinuating \nthemselves and hurting you. And if they cannot be banished, at least un­\nderstand that they are plotting against you, and pay no heed to whatever \nfriendliness they feign. Your only weapon in such a situation is your own \nwariness. If you cannot banish them immediately, then plot for the best \ntime to act. \nImage: A Viper crushed \nbeneath your foot but left \nalive, will rear up and bite \nyou with a double dose of \nvenom. An enemy that is \nleft around is like a half­\ndead viper that you nurse \nback to health. Time makes \nthe venom grow stronger. \nAuthority: For it must be \nnoted, that men must either be \ncaressed or else annihilated; \nthey will revenge themselves \nfor small injuries, but cannot \ndo so for great ones; the injury \ntherefore that we do to a man \nmust be such that we need not \nfear his vengeance. (Niccolo \nMachiavelli, 1469-1527) \nLAW 15 113 \n114 LAW 15 REVERSAL \nThis law should very rarely be ignored, but it does sometimes happen that \nit is better to let your enemies destroy themselves, if such a thing is possi­\nble, than to make them suffer by YOUf hand. In warf are, for exa mple, a \ngood general knows that if he attacks an army when it is comered, its sol­\ndiers will fight much more fiercely. It is sometimes better, then, to leave \nthem an escape route, a way out. As they retreat, they wear themselves out, \nand are ultiinately more demoralized by the retreat than by any defeat he \nrnight inflict on the battlefield. When you have someone on the ropes, \nthen-but only when you are SUfe they have no chance of recove ry-you \nrnight let them hang themsel ves. Let them be the agents of their own de­\nstruction. The result will be the same, and you won't feel half as bad. \nFinally, sometimes by crushing an enemy, you embitter them so much \nthat they spend years and years plotting revenge.

At the castle of Javiac he met and fell in love \nwith the beautiful lady of the house, Madame Guillelma de J aviac, He sang \nher his songs, recited his poetry, played che ss with her, and little by little \nshe in turn fell in love with him. Guillaume had a friend, Sir Pierre de Bar­\njac, who traveled with him and who was also received at the castle, And \nPierre too fell in love with a lady in Javiac, the gracious but temperamental \nViernetta. \nThen one day Pierre and Viernetta had a violent quarrel. The lady \ndismissed him, and he sought out his friend Guillaume to help heal the \nbreach and get him back in her good graces. Guillaume was about to leave \nthe castle for a whil e, but on his return, several weeks later, he worked his \nmagie, and Pierre and the lady were reconciled. Pierre feit that his love \nhad increased tenfold-that there was no stronger love, in fact, than the \nlove that follows recon ciliat ion. The stronger and longer the disagreement, \nhe told Guilla ume, the sweeter the feeling that comes with peace and \nrapprochement. \nAs a troubadour, Sir Guillaume prided himself on experiencing all the \njoys and sorrows of love. On hearing his friend's talk, he too wanted know \nthe bliss of recon ciliation after a quarr el. He theref ore feigned great anger \nwith Lady Guillelma, stopp ed sending her love letters, and abruptly left the \ncastle and stayed away, even during the festivals and hunts. This drove the \nyoung lady wild. \nGuillelma sent messengers to Guillaume to find out what had hap­\npened, but he turned the messengers away. He thought an this would make \nher angry, forcing him to plead for reconciliation as Pierre had. Instead, \nhowever, his absence had the opposite effe ct: It made Guillelma love him \nall the more. Now the lady pursued her knight, sending messengers and \nlove notes of her own . This was alm ost unheard of-a lady never pursue d \nher troubadour. And Guillaume did not like it. Gui llelma' s forwa rdness \nmade him feel she had lost some of her dignity. Not only was he no longer \nsure of his plan, he was no longer sure of his lady. \nFinally, after several months of not hearing from Guillaume, Guillelma \ngave up. She sent him no more messengers, and he began to wonder-per­\nhaps she was angry ? Perhaps the plan had worked after all? So much the \nbetter if she was. He would wait no more-it was time to reconcile. So he \nput on his best robe, decked the horse in its fanciest capar ison, chose a \nmagnifi cent heImet, and rode off to Javiac. \nOn hearing that her beloved had returned, Guillelma rushed to see \nhim, knelt before him, dropped her veil to kiss him, and begged forgive­\nness for whatever slight had caused his anger. Imagine his confusion and \ndesp air-his plan had failed abysmally. She was not angry, she had never \nbeen angry, she was only deeper in love, and he would never experience \nthe joy of reconciliation after a quarrel. Seeing her now, and still desperate \nto taste that jOY, he decided to try one more time: He drove her away with \nharsh words and threatening gestures. She left, this time vowing never to \nsee hirn again. \nThe next morning the troubadour regretted what he had done. He \nrode back to Javiac, but the lady would not receive hirn, and ordered her \nservants to chase hirn away, across the drawbridge and over the hill. Guil­\nlaume fled. Back in his chamber he collapsed and started to cry: He had \nmade a terrible mistake. Over the next year, unable to see his lady, he ex­\nperienced the absence, the terrible absence, that can only inflame love. He \nwrote one of his most beautiful poems, \"My song ascends for mercy pray­\ning.\" And he sent many letters to Guillelma, explaining what he had done, \nand begging forgiveness. \nAfter a great deal of this, Lady Guillelma, remembering his beautiful \nsongs, his handsome figure, and his skills in dancing and falconry, found \nherself yearning to have hirn back. As penance for his cruelty, she ordered \nhirn to remove the nail from the little finger of his right hand, and to send it \nto her along with a poem describing his miseries. \nHe did as she asked. Finally Guillaume de Balaun was able to taste the \nultimate sensation-a reconciliation even surpassing that of his friend \nPierre. \nInterpretation \nTrying to discover the joys of reconciliation, Guillaume de Balaun inadver­\ntently experienced the truth of the law of absence and presence. At the \nstart of an affair, you need to heighten your presence in the eyes of the \nother. If you absent yourself too early, you may be forgotten. But once \nyour lover's emotions are engaged, and the feeling of love has crystallized, \nabsence inflames and excites. Giving no reason for your absence excites \neven more: The other person assurnes he or she is at fault. While you are \naway, the lover's imagination takes flight, and a stimulated imagination \ncannot help but make love grow stronger. Conversely, the more Guillelma \npursued Guillaume, the less he loved her-she had become too present, \ntoo accessible, leaving no room for his imagination and fancy, so that his \nfeelings were suffocating. When she finally stopped sending messengers, \nhe was able to breathe again, and to return to his plan. \nWhat withdraws, what becomes scarce, suddenly seems to deserve our \nrespect and honor. What stays too long, inundating us with its presence, \nmakes us disdain it. In the Middle Ages, ladies were constantly putting \ntheir knights through trials of love, sending them on some long and ardu­\nous quest-all to create a pattern of absence and presence. Indeed, had \nGuillaume not left his lady in the first place, she might have been forced to \nsend hirn away, creating an absence of her own. \nAbsence diminishes minor passions and inflames great ones, \nas the wind douses a candle and fans a fire. \nLa Roche foucaul d, 1613-1680 1'1\\'1' 1111'1'1 I','; m \n1'111: U)C� \nWhile serving llnder \nthe Duke Ai o[ Lu, \nT'ien Jao, rescnting hi ....

SEN, Hl., \n1974 \nLAW 16 117 \n118 LAW 16 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW \nFor many centuries the Assyrians ruled upper Asia with an iron fist. In the \neighth century B.C., however, the people of Medea (now northwestem \nIran) revolted against them, and finally broke free. Now the Medes had to \nestablish a new govemment. Determined to avoid any form of despotism, \nthey refused to give ultimate power to any one man, or to establish a \nmonarchy. Without aleader, however, the country soon fell into chaos, \nand fractured into small kingdoms, with village fighting against village . \nIn one such village lived a man named Deioces, who began to make a \nname for hirnself for fair dealing and the ability to settle disputes. \nHe did this so successfully, in fact, that soon any legal conflict in the \narea was brought to hirn, and his power increased. Throughout the land, \nthe law had fallen into disrepute--the judges were corrupt, and no one en­\ntrusted their cases to the courts any more, resorting to violence instead. \nWhen news spread of Deioces' wisdom, incorruptibility, and unshakable \nimpartiality, Medean villages far and wide tumed to hirn to settle all man­\nner of cases. Soon he became the sole arbiter of justice in the land. \nAt the height of his power, Deioces suddenly decided he had had \nenough. He would no longer sit in the chair of judgment, would hear no \nmore suits, settle no more disputes between brother and brother, village \nand village . Complaining that he was spending so much time dealing with \nother people's problems that he had neglected his own affairs, he retired. \nThe country once again descended into chaos. With the sudden with­\ndrawal of a powerful arbiter like Deioces, crime increased, and contempt \nfor the law was never greater. The Medes held a meeting of all the villages \nto decide how to get out of their predicament. \"We cannot continue to live \nin this country under these conditions,\" said one triballeader. \"Let us ap­\npoint one of our number to rule so that we can live under orderly govem­\nment, rather than losing our hornes altogether in the present chaos.\" \nAnd so, despite all that the Medes had suffered under the Assyrian des­\npotism, they decided to set up a monarchy and name a king. And the man \nthey most wanted to rule, of course, was the fair-minded Deioces. He was \nhard to convince, for he wanted nothing more to do with the villages' in­\nfighting and bickering, but the Medes begged and pleaded -without him the \ncountry had descended into astate of lawlessness. Deioces finally agreed. \nYet he also imposed condition s. An enormous palace was to be con­\nstructed for him, he was to be provided with bodyguards, and a capital city \nwas to be built from which he could rule. All of this was done, and Deioces \nsettled into his palace. In the center of the capital, the palace was sur­\nrounded by walls, and completely inaccessible to ordinary people. Deioces \nthen established the terms of his rule: Admission to his presence was for­\nbidden. Communication with the king was only possible through messen­\ngers. No one in the royal court could see him more than once a week, and \nthen only by permission. \nDeioces ruled for fifty-three years, extended the Medean empire, and \nestablished the foundation for what would later be the Persian empire, \nunder his great-great-g randson Cyrus. During Deioces' reign, the people's \nrespect for hirn gradually tumed into a form of worship : He was not a mere \nmortal, they believed, but the son of a god. \nInterpretati on \nDeioces was a man of great ambition. He determined early on that the \ncountry needed a strong ruler, and that he was the man for the job. \nIn aland plagued with anarchy, the most powerful man is the judge \nand arbiter. So Deioces began his career by making his reputation as a man \nof impeccable fairness. \nAt the height of his power as a judge, however, Deioces realized the \ntruth of the law of absence and presence: By serving so many clients, he \nhad become too noticeable, too available, and had lost the respect he had \nearlier enjoyed. People were taking his services for granted. The only way \nto regain the veneration and power he wanted was to withdraw com­\npletely, and let the Medes taste what life was like without hirn. As he ex­\npected, they came begging for hirn to rule. \nOnce Deioces had discovered the truth of this law, he carried it to its \nultimate realizati on. In the palace his people had built for hirn, none could \nsee hirn except a few courtiers, and those only rarely. As Herodotus wrote, \n\"There was a risk that if they saw him habitually, it might lead to jealousy \nand resentment, and plots would follow; but if nobody saw hirn, the legend \nwould grow that he was a being of a different order from mere men.\" \nA man said to a Dervish: \"\"Why do I not see you more often ?\" The Dervish \nreplied, \"Because the words '\"Why have you not been to see me?' are \nsweeter to my ear than the words '\"Why have you come again?'\" \nMulla Jami, quoted in ldries Shah 's Caravan 01' Dreams, 1968 \nKEYS TO POWER \nEverything in the world depends on absence and presence. A strong pres­\nence will draw power and attention to you-you shine more brightly than \nthose around you. But a point is inevitably reached where too much pres­\nence creates the opposite effect: The more you are seen and heard from, \nthe more your value degrad es. You become a habit. No matter how hard \nyou try to be different, subtly, without your knowing why, people respect \nyou less and less. At the right moment you must leam to withdraw yourself \nbefore they unconsciously push you away. It is agame of hide-and-seek. \nThe truth of this law can most easily be appreciated in matters of love \nand seduction. In the beginning stages of an affair, the lover's absence stim­\nulates your imagina tion, forming a sort of aura around hirn or her. But this \naura fades when you know too much- when your imagination no longer \nhas room to roam. The loved one becomes a person like anyone else, a \nperson whose presence is taken for granted. This is why the seventeenth­\ncentury French courtesan Ninon de Lenclos advised constant feints at with­\ndrawal from one's lover. \"Love never dies of starvation,\" she wrote, \"but \noften of indigestion. \" \nLAW 16 119 \n120 LAW 16 The moment you allow yourself to be treate d like anyone else, it is too \nlate-y ou are swallowed and dige sted. To prevent this you need to starve \nthe other person of your presence. Force their respect by threatenir1g them \nwith the pos sibility that they will lose you far good; create a pattern of pres­\nence and absence. \nOnce you die, everything about you will seem different You will be \nsurroun ded by an instant aura of respect. People will remember their criti­\ncisms of you, their arguments with you, and will be fille d with regret and \nguilt. They are rnissing a presence that will never return. But you do not \nhave to wait until you die: By completely withdrawing for a while, you cre­\nate a kind of death before death. And when you come back, it will be as if \nyou had come back from the dead-an air of resurrection will ding to you, \nand people will be reliev ed at your return. This is how Deioces made him­\nself king. \nNapoleon was recognizing the law of absence and presence when he \nsaid, \"If I am often seen at the theater, people will cease to notice me.\" \nToday, in a world inunda ted with presence through the flood of image s, the \ngame of withdrawal is all the more powerful. We rarely know when to \nwithdraw anymore, and nothing seems private, so we are awed by anyone \nwho is able to disa ppear by choic e. Novelists J. D. Salinger and Thomas \nPynchon have created cultlike followings by knowing when to disappe ar. \nAnother, more everyday side of this law, but one that demonstrates \nits truth even further, is the law of scarcity in the science of economics. \nBy withdrawi ng something from the market, you create instant value. In \nseventeenth-century Holland, the upper classes wan ted to make the tulip \nmore than just a bea utiful flower-they wante d it to be a kind of status sym­\nbol. Making the flower scarce, indeed almost impossible to obtain, they \nsparked what was later called tulip omania. A single flower was now worth \nmore than its weight in gold. In our own century, similarly , the art dealer \nJoseph Duv een insisted on making the paintings he sold as scarce and rare \nas poss ible. To keep their prices elevated and their status high, he bought up \nwhole collections and stored them in his basement. The paintings that he \nsold became more than just paintin gs-- they were felish objects, their value \nincreased by their rarity. \"You can get all the pictures you want at fifty thou­\nsand dollars apiece-that's easy,\" he once said. \"But to get pictures at a \nquarter of a mill ion apiece-that wants doin g!\" \nI mag e: \nThe Sun. lt can only be \nappreciated by its absence. \nThe longer the days of rain, the \nmore the sun is craved. But too many \nhot days and the sun overwhelms. \nLearn to keep yourself obscure and \nmake people demand your return. \nExtend the law of scarcity to your own skills. Make what you are offer­\ning the world rare and hard to find, and you instantly increase its value. \nThere always comes a moment when those in power overstay their \nwelcome. We have grown tired of them, lost respect for them; we see them \nas no different from the rest of mankind, which is to say that we see them as \nrather worse, since we inevitably compare their current status in our eyes \nto their former one. There is an art to knowing when to retire. If it is done \nright, you regain the respect you had lost, and retain a part of your power. \nThe greatest mler of the sixteenth century was Charles V. King of \nSpain, Hapsburg emperor, he governed an empire that at one point in­\ncluded much of Europe and the New World. Yet at the height of his power, \nin 1557, he retired to the monastery of Yuste. All of Europe was captivated \nby his sudden withdrawal; people who had hated and feared hirn suddenly \ncalled hirn great, and he came to be seen as a saint. In more recent times, \nthe film actress Greta Garbo was never more admired than when she re­\ntired, in 1941. For some her absence came too soon-she was in her mid­\nthirties-but she wisely preferred to leave on her own terms, rather than \nwaiting for her audi ence to grow tired of her. \nMake yourself too available and the aura of power you have created \naround yourself will wear away. Turn the game around: Make yourself less \naccessible and you increase the value of your presence. \nAuthority: \nUse absence to create \nrespect and esteern. If presence \ndiminishes farne, absence augments it. \nA man who when absent is regarded as a \nlion becomes when present so me thing com­\nmon and ridiculo us. Talents lose their luster \nif we become too familiar with them, for the \nouter shell of the mind is more readily seen \nthan its rich inner kernel. Even the outstand-\ning genius makes use of retirement so that \nmen rnay honor hirn and so that the \nyearning aroused by his absence \nrnay cause hirn to be esteerned. \n(Baltasar Graciän, \n1601-1658) \nLAW 16 121 \n122 LAW 16 REVERSAL \nThis law only applies once a certain level of power has been attained. The \nneed to withdraw only comes after you have established your presence; \nleave too early and you do not increase YOUf respect, you are simply for­\ngotten. When you are first entering onto the world's stage, create an image \nthat is recogniza ble, reproducible, and is seen everywh ere. Until that status \nis attained, absence is dangerous-instead of fanning the flarnes, it will ex­\ntinguish them. \nIn love and seduction, similarly, absence is only effective once you \nhave sUfrounded the other with YOUf image, been seen by hirn or her \neverywhe re. Everything must remind YOUf lover of your presence, so that \nwhen you do choose to be away, the lover will always be thinking of you, \nwill always be seeing you in his or her mind's eye. \nRememb er: In the beginning, make yourself not scarce but om­\nnipresent. Only what is seen, appreciated, and loved will be missed in its \nabsence. \nLAW \n17 \nKEE P OTHERS IN \nSUS PENDED TERR OR : \nCUL TIV ATE AN AIR OF \nUN PREDICT ABIL ITY \nJUDGMENT \nHumans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to \nsee familiarity in other people s actions. Your predictabil­\nity gives them a sense of control. Turn the tables: Be de­\nliberately unpredictable. Behavior that seems to have no \nconsistency or purpose will keep them o.tJ-balance, and \nthey will wear themselves out trying to explain your \nmoves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate \nand terrorize. \n123 \n124 LAW 17 OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW \nIn May of 1972, chess champion Boris Spassky anxiously awaited his riyal \nBobby Fischer in Reykjavik, Iceland. The two men had been scheduled to \nmeet for the World Championship of Chess, but Fischer had not arrived on \ntime and the match was on hold. Fischer had problems with the size of the \nprize money, problems with the way the money was to be distributed, \nproblems with the logistics of holding the match in Iceland. He might back \nout at any moment. \nSpassky tried to be patient. His Russian bosses feit that Fischer was hu­\nmiliating him and told him to walk away, but Spassky wanted this match. \nHe knew he could destroy Fischer, and nothing was going to spoil the \ngreatest victory of his career. \"So it seems that all OUT work may come to \nnothing,\" Spassky told a comrade. \"But what can we do? It is Bobby's \nmove. If he comes, we play. If he does not come; we do not play. A man \nwho is willing to commit suicide has the initiative.\" \nFischer finally arrived in Reykjavik, but the problems, and the threat \nof cancellation, continued. He disliked the hall where the match was to be \nfought, he criticized the lighting, he complained about the noise of the \ncameras, he even hated the chairs in which he and Spassky were to sit. \nNow the Soviet Union took the initiative and threatened to withdraw their \nman. \nThe bluff apparently worked: After all the weeks of waiting, the end­\nless and infuriating negotiations, Fischer agreed to play. Everyone was re­\nlieved, no one more than Spassky. But on the day of the official \nintroductions, Fischer arrived very late, and on the day when the \"Match \nof the Century\" was to begin, he was late again. This time, however, the \nconsequences would be dire: If he showed up too late he would forfeit the \nfirst game. What was going on? Was he playing some sort of mind game? \nOr was Bobby Fischer perhaps afraid ofBoris Spassky? It seemed to the as­\nsembled grand masters, and to Spassky, that this young kid from Brooklyn \nhad a terrible case of the jitters. At 5:09 Fischer showed up, exactly one \nminute before the match was to be canceled. \nThe first game of a chess toumament is critical, since it sets the tone for \nthe months to come. It is often a slow and quiet struggle, with the two play­\ners preparing themselves for the war and trying to read each other's strate­\ngies. This game was different. Fischer made a terrible move early on, \nperhaps the worst of his career, and when Spassky had hirn on the ropes, \nhe seemed to give up. Yet Spassky knew that Fischer never gave up. Even \nwhen facing checkmate, he fought to the bitter end, wearing the opponent \ndown. This time, though, he seemed resigned. Then suddenly he broke out \na bold move that put the room in a buzz. The move shocked Spassky, but \nhe recovered and managed to win the game. But no one could figure out \nwhat Fischer was up to. Had he lost deliberately? Or was he rattled? Unset­\ntled? Even, as some thought, insane? \nAfter his defeat in the first game, Fischer complai ned all the more \nloudly about the room, the cameras, and everything else. He also failed to \nshow up on time for the second game. This time the organizers had had \nenough : He was given a forfeit. Now he was down two games to none, a \nposition from which no one had ever come back to win a chess champi­\nonship. Fischer was clearly unhing ed. Yet in the third game, as all those \nwho witnessed it remember, he had a ferocious look in his eye, a look that \nclearly bothered Spassky. And despite the hole he had dug for hirnself, he \nseemed supremely confident. He did make what appeared to be another \nblunder, as he had in the first game-but his cocky air made Spassky smell \na trap. Yet despite the Russian's suspicions, he could not figure out the trap, \nand before he knew it Fischer had checkmated hirn. In fact Fischer's un­\northodox tactics had completely unnerved his opponent. At the end of the \ngame, Fischer leaped up and rushed out, yelling to his confederates as he \nsmashed a fist into his palm, \"I'm crushing him with brute force!\" \nIn the next games Fischer pulled moves that no one had seen from \nhirn before, moves that were not his style. Now Spassky started to make \nblunders. After losing the sixth game, he started to cry. One grand master \nsaid, \"Mter this, Spassky's got to ask hirnself if it's safe to go back to Rus­\nsia.\" After the eighth game Spassky decided he knew what was happening: \nBobby Fischer was hypnotizing hirn. He decided not to look Fischer in the \neye; he lost anyway. \nAfter the fourteenth game he called a staff conference and announ ced, \n\"An attempt is being made to control my mind.\" He wondered whether the \norange juice they drank at the chess table could have been drugge d. \nMaybe chemicals were being blown into the air. Finally Spassky went pub­\nHc, accusing the Fischer team of putting something in the chairs that was al­\ntering Spassky's mind. The KGB went on alert: Boris Spassky was \nembarrassing the Soviet Union! \nThe chairs were taken apart and X-rayed. A chemist found nothing \nunusual in them. The only things anyone found anywhere, in fact, were \ntwo dead flies in a Hghting fixture. Spassky began to complain of hallucina­\ntions. He tried to keep playing, but his mind was unraveling. He could not \ngo on. On September 2, he resigned. Although still relatively young, he \nnever recovered from this defeat. \nInterpretation \nIn previous games between Fischer and Spassky, Fischer had not fared \nweIl. Spassky had an uncanny ability to read his opponent's strategy and \nuse it against hirn. Adaptable and patient, he would build attacks that would \ndefeat not in seven moves but in seventy. He defeated Fischer every time \nthey played because he saw much further ahead, and because he was a bril­\nHant psychologist who never lost control. One master said, \"He doesn't just \nlook for the best move. He looks for the move that will disturb the man he \nis playing.\" \nFischer, however, finaHy understood thll;t this was one of the keys to \nSpassky's success: He played on your predictability, defeated you at your \nown game. Everything Fischer did for the champ ionship match was an at-\nLAW 17 125 \n126 LAW 17 tempt to put the initiative on his side and to keep Spassky off-balance. \nClearly the endless waiting had an effect on Spassky's psyche. Most power­\nful of all, though, were Fischer' s deliberate blunders and his appearance of \nhaving no clear strategy. In fact, he was doing everything he could to \nscramble his old patterns, even if it meant losing the first match and forfeit­\ning the second. \nSpassky was known for his sangf roid and levelheadedness, but for the \nfirst time in his life he could not figure out his opponent. He slowly melted \ndown, until at the end he was the one who seemed insane . \nChess contains the concentrated essence of life: First, because to win \nyou have to be supremely patient and farseeing; and second, because the \ngame is built on patterns, whole sequences of moves that have been played \nbefore and will be played again, with slight alterations, in any one match. \nYour opponent analyzes the patterns you are playing and uses them to try \nto fore see your moves. Allowing hirn nothing predictable to base his strat­\negy on gives you a big advantage. In chess as in life, when people cannot \nfigure out what you are doing, they are kept in astate of terror-waiting, \nuncertain, confused. \nLife at court is a serious, mela nchol y game of chess, which requires us to draw \nup our pieces and batteries, form a plan, pursue it, parry that of our \nadversary. Sometime s, however, it is better to take risks \nand play the most capr icious, unpred ictable move. \nleall de La Bmyere, 1645-1 696 \nKEYS TO POWER \nNothing is more terrifying than the sudden and unpredicta ble.

Mter one has occurred, we wait in terror for the next one. \nTo a lesser degree, this is the effect that unpredictable human behavior has \non uso \nAnimals behave in set patterns, which is why we are able to hunt and \nkill them. Only man has the capacity to consciously alter his behavior, to \nimprovise and overcome the weight of routine and habit. Yet most men do \nnot realize this power. They prefer the comf orts of routine, of giving in to \nthe animal nature that has them repeating the same compulsive actions \ntime and time aga in. They do this because it requires no effort, and be­\ncause they mistakenly believe that if they do not unsettle others, they will \nbe left alone. Understa nd: A person of power instills a kind of fear by delib­\nerately unset tling those around hirn to keep the initiative on his side. You \nsometimes need to strike without warning, to make others tremble when \nthey least expect it. It is a device that the powerful have used for centuries. \nFilippo Maria, the last of the Visconti dukes of Milan in fifteenth­\ncent ury Italy, consciously did the opposite of what everyone expected of \nhirn. For instanc e, he might suddenly shower a courtier with atte ntion, and \nthen, once the man had come to expect a promotion to higher office, \nwould suddenly start treating hirn with the utmost disdain. Confused, the \nman might leave the court, when the duke would suddenly recall hirn and \nstart treating hirn weIl again. Doubly confused, the courtier would wonder \nwhether his assumption that he would be promoted had become obvious, \nand offensive, to the duke, and would start to behave as if he no longer ex­\npected such honor. The duke would rebuke hirn for his lack of ambition \nand would send hirn away. \nThe secret of dealing with Filippo was simple: Do not presume to \nknow what he wants. Do not try to guess what will please hirn. Never inject \nyour will; just surrender to his will. Then wait to see what happens. Amidst \nthe confusion and uncertainty he created, the duke ruled supreme, unchal­\nlenged and at peace. \nUnpredic tability is most often the tactic of the master, but the under­\ndog too can use it to great effect. If you find yourself outnumbered or cor­\nnered, throw in aseries of unpredictable moves. Your enemies will be so \nconfused that they will pull back or make a tactical blunder. \nIn the spring of 1862, during the American Civil War, General \nStonewall Jackson and a force of 4,600 Confederate soldiers were torment­\ning the larger Union forces in the Shenandoah Valley. Meanwhile, not far \naway, General George Brinton McClellan, heading a force of 90,000 \nUnion soldiers, was marching south from Washington, D.C., to lay siege to \nRichmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital. As the weeks of the cam­\npaign went by, Jackson repeatedly led his soldiers out of the Shenandoah \nValley, then back to it. \nHis movements made no sense. Was he preparing to help defend \nRichmond? Was he marching on Washington, now that McClellan's ab­\nsence had left it unprotected? Was he heading north to wreak havoc up \nthere? Why was his small force moving in circles? \nJackson's inexplicable moves made the Union generals delay the \nmarch on Richmond as they waited to figure out what he was up to. Mean­\nwhile, the South was able to pour reinforcements into the town. A battle \nthat could have crushed the Confederacy tumed into a stalemate. Jackson \nused this tactic time and again when facing numerically superior forces. \n\"Always mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy, if possible,\" he said, \n\" ... such tactics will win every time and a small army may thus destroy a \nlarge one.\" \nThis law applies not only to war but to everyday situations. People are \nalways trying to read the motives behind your actions and to use your pre­\ndictability against you. Throw in a completely inexplicable move and you \nput them on the defensive. Because they do not und erstand you, they are \nunnerved, and in such astate you can easily intimidate them. \nPablo Picasso once remarked, \"The best calculation is the absence of \ncalculation. Once you have attained a certain level of recognition, others \ngenerally figure that when you do something, it's for an intelligent reason. \nSo it's really foolish to plot out your movements too carefully in advance. \nYou're better off acting capriciously.\" \nFor a while, Picasso worked with the art dealer Paul Rosenberg. At first \nLAW 17 127 \n128 LAW 17 he allowed hirn a fair amount of latitude in handling his paintings, then one \nday, for no apparent reason, he told the man he would no longer give hirn \nany work to seIl. As Picasso explained, \"Rosenberg would spend the next \nforty-eight hours trying to figure out why. Was I reserving things for some \nother dealer? I'd go on working and sleeping and Rosenberg would spend \nhis time figuring. In two days he'd come back, nerves jangled, anxious, say­\ning, 'After all, dear friend, you wouldn't turn me down if I offered you this \nmuch [naming a substantially higher figure] for those paintings rather than \nthe price I've been accustomed to paying you, would you?' \" \nUnpredictability is not only a weapon of terror: Scrambling YOUf pat­\nterns on a day-to-day basis will cause a stir around you and stimulate inter­\nest. People will talk about you, ascribe motives and explanations that have \nnothing to do with the truth, but that keep you constantly in their minds. In \nthe end, the more capricious you appear, the more respect you will gamer. \nOnly the terminally subordinate act in a predictable manner. \nImage : The Cyclone. A \nwind that cannot be fore­\nseen. Sudden shifts in \nthe barometer, in­\nexplicable changes \nin direction and \nvelocity. There is \nno defense: A \ncyclone sows \nterror and \nconfusion. \nAuthority: The enlightened ruler is so mysterious that he seems \nto dweIl nowhere, so inexplicable that no one can seek hirn. \nHe reposes in nonaction above, and his ministers tremble \nbelow. (Han-fei-tzu, Chinese philosoph er, third century B.C.) \nREVERSAL \nSometim es predictability can work in your favor: By creating a pattern for \npeople to be familiar and comfortable with, you can lull them to sleep. \nThey have prepared everything according to their preconceived notions \nabout you. You can use this in several ways: First, it sets up a smoke screen, \na comfortable front behind which you can carry on deceptive actions. Sec­\nond, it allows you on rare occasions to do something completely against \nthe pattern, unsettling YOUf opponent so deeply he will fall to the ground \nwithout being pushed. \nIn 1974 Muhammad Ali and George Foreman were scheduled to fight \nfor the world heavyweight boxing champ ionship. Everyone knew what \nwould happen: Big George Foreman would try to land a knockout punch \nwhile Ali would dance around hirn, wearing hirn out. That was Ali's way of \nfighting, his pattern, and he had not changed it in more than ten years. But \nin this case it seemed to give Foreman the advantage : He had a devastating \npunch, and if he waited, sooner or later Ali would have to come to hirn. \nAli, the master strategist, had other plans: In press conferences before the \nbig fight, he said he was going to change his style and punch it out with \nForeman. No one, least of all Foreman, believed this for a second. That \nplan would be suicide on Ali's part; he was playing the comedian, as usual. \nThen, before the fight, Ali's trainer loosened the ropes around the ring, \nsomething a trainer would do if his boxer were intending to slug it out. But \nno one believed this ploy; it had to be a setup. \nTo everyone's amazement, Ali did exactly what he had said he would \ndo. As Foreman waited for hirn to dance around, Ali went right up to hirn \nand slugged it out. He completely upset his opponent's strategy. At a loss, \nForeman ended up wearing hirnself out, not by chasing Ali but by throw­\ning punches wildly, and taking more and more counterpunc hes. Finally, \nAli landed a dramatic right cross that knocked out Foreman. The habit of \nassuming that a person's behavior will fit its previous patterns is so strong \nthat not even Ali's announcement of a strategy change was enough to upset \nit. Foreman walked into a trap-the trap he had been told to expect. \nA warning: Unpredictability can work against you sometimes, es­\npecially if you are in a subordinate position. There are times when it is bet­\nter to let people feel comfortable and settled around you than to disturb \nthem. Too much unpredictability will be seen as a sign of indecisiven ess, or \neven of some more serious psychic problem. Patterns are powerful, and \nyou can terrify people by disrupting them. Such power should only be \nused judiciously. \nLAW 17 129 \n130 LAW \n18 \nDO NOT BUILD FO RTRESSES \nTO PROT ECT YO URSE LF-\nISO LATI ON IS DA NG EROUS \nJUDGM ENT \nThe world is dangerous and enemies are everywhere­\neveryone has to protect themselves . A fortress seems the \nsafest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it \nprotects you from-it cuts you off from valuable informa­\ntion, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target.

You are \nshielded from your enemies by the crowd. \nTRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW \nCh'in Shih Huang Ti, the first emperor of China (221-210 B.C.), was the \nmig htie st man of his day. His empire was vaster and more powernd than \nthat of Alexander the Great. He had conquered all of the kingdoms sur­\nround ing his own kingdom of Ch'in and unified them into one massive \nrealm called China. But in the last years ofhis life, few, if anyone , saw hirn. \nThe emperor lived in the most magnificent palace built to that date, in \nthe capital of Hsien-y ang. The palace had 270 pavili ons; all of these were \nconn ected by secret underground passageways, allowing the emperor to \nmove through the palace without anyone seeing him. He slept in a differ­\nent room every night, and anyone who inadvertently laid eyes on hirn was \ninstantly beheaded. Only a handful of men knew his whereabouts, and if \nthey revealed it to anyone, they, too, were put to death . \nThe first emperor had grown so terrified of human contact that when \nhe had to leave the palace he traveled incognito, disguising hirnself care­\nfully. On one such trip through the provin ces, he suddenly died. His body \nwas borne back to the capital in the emperor's carriage, with a cart packed \nwith salted fish trailing behind it to cover up the smell of the rotting \ncorpse-no one was to know of his death. He died alone, far from his \nwives, his family, his friends, and his courtiers, accompanied only by a \nminister and a handful of eunuc hs. \nInterpretation \nShih Huang Ti started off as the king of Ch'in, a fearless warrior of unbri­\ndled amb ition. Writers of the time described hirn as a man with \"a waspish \nnose, eyes like slits, the voice of a jackal, and the heart of a tiger or wolf. \" \nHe could be merciful sometimes, but more often he \"swallowed men up \nwithout ascrupIe .\" It was through trickery and violence that he conquered \nthe provinces surrounding his own and created China, forging a single na­\ntion and culture out of many. He broke up the feudal system, and to keep \nan eye on the many members of the royal families that were scattered \nacross the realm' s various kingdoms, he moved 120,000 ofthem to the cap­\nital, where he housed the most important courtiers in the vast palace of \nHsien-yang. He consolidated the many walls on the borders and built them \ninto the Great Wall of China . He standardi zed the country's laws, its writ­\nten language, even the size of its cartw heels. \nAs part of this process of unification, however, the first emperor out­\nlawed the writings and teachings of Confucius, the philosopher whose \nideas on the moral life had already become virtually a religion in Chinese \nculture. On Shih Huang Ti's order, thousands of books relating to Confu­\ncius were burned, and anyone who quoted Confucius was to be beheaded. \nThis made many enemies for the emperor, and he grew constantly afraid, \neven paranoid. The executions mounted. A contemporary, the writer Han­\nfei-tzu, noted that \"Ch'in has been victorious for four generations, yet has \nlived in constant terror and app rehension of destruct ion.\" \nAs the emperor withdrew deeper and deeper into the palace to protect 1'111-: \\1 1,, <')1 1·: 01 1'111'. \nIU.I) 1)1-1'1'1 1 \nThe \"Red Dealh\" had \nlung devaslated the \ncowllry.

Eunuchs and ministers enacted \npolitical policies without his approval or even his knowledge; they also \nplotted against hirn. By the end, he was emperor in name only, and was so \nisolated that barely anyone knew he had died. He had probably been poi­\nsoned by the same scheming ministers who encouraged his isolation. \nThat is what isolation brings: Retreat into a fortress and you lose con­\ntact with the sources of your power. You lose your ear for what is happen­\ning around you, as weIl as a sense of proportion. Instead of being safer, you \ncut yourself off from the kind of knowledge on which your life depends. \nNever enclose yourself so far from the streets that you cannot hear what is \nhappening around you, including the plots against you. \nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW \nLouis XIV had the palace of Versailles built for hirn and his court in the \n1660s, and it was like no other royal palace in the world. As in a beehive, \neverything revolved around the royal person. He lived surrounded by the \nnobility, who were allotted apartments nestled around his, their closeness \nto hirn dependent on their rank. The king's bedroom occupied the literal \ncenter of the palace and was the focus of everyone's attention. Every mom­\ning the king was greeted in this room by a ritual known as the lever. \nAt eight A.M., the king's first valet, who slept at the foot of the royal \nbed, would awaken His Majesty. Then pages would open the door and \nadmit those who had a function in the lever. The order of their entry was \nprecise: First came the king's illegitimate sons and his grandchildren, then \nthe princes and princesses of the blood, and then his physician and sur­\ngeon. There followed the grand officers of the wardrobe, the king's official \nreader, and those in charge of entertaining the king. Next would arrive var­\nious govemment officials, in ascending order of rank. Last but not least \ncame those attending the lever by special invitation. By the end of the cere­\nmony, the room would be packed with weIl over a hundred royal atten­\ndants and visitors. \nThe day was organized so that all the palace's energy was directed at \nand passed through the king. Louis was constantly attended by courtiers \nand officials, all asking for his advice and judgment. To all their questions \nhe usually replied, \"I shall see.\" \nAs Saint-Simon noted, \"If he tumed to someone, asked hirn a ques­\ntion, made an insignificant remark, the eyes of all present were tumed on \nthis person. It was a distinction that was talked of and increased prestige.\" \nThere was no possibility of privacy in the palace, not even for the king­\nevery room communicated with another, and every hallway led to larger \nrooms where groups of nobles gathered constantly. Everyone's actions \nwere interdependent, and nothing and no one passed unnoticed: \"The \nking not only saw to it that all the high nobility was present at his court,\" \nwrote Saint-Simon, \"he demanded the same of the minor nobility. At his \nlever and coucher, at his meals, in his gardens of Versailles, he always looked \nabout hirn, noticing everything. He was offended if the most distingu ished \nnobles did not live permanently at court, and those who showed them­\nselves never or hardly ever, incurred his full displeasure . If one of these de­\nsired something, the king would say proudly : 'I do not know hirn,' and the \njudgment was irrevocab le.\" \nInterpretation \nLouis XIV came to power at the end of a terrible civil war, the Fronde. A \nprincipal instigator of the war had been the nobility, which deeply resented \nthe growing power of the throne and yearned for the days of feudalism, \nwhen the lords ruled their own fiefdoms and the king had little authority \nover them. The nobles had lost the civil war, but they remained a fractious, \nresentful lot. \nThe construction of Versailles, then, was far more than the decadent \nwhim of a luxury-loving king. It served a crucial function: The king could \nkeep an eye and an ear on everyone and everything around hirn. The \nonce proud nobility was reduced to squabbling over the right to help the \nking put on his robes in the morning. There was no possibility here of pri­\nvacy-no possibility of isolation. Louis XIV very early grasped the truth \nthat for a king to isolate hirnself is gravely dangerou s. In his absence, con­\nspiracies will spring up like mushrooms after rain, animosities will crystal­\nlize into factions, and rebellion will break out before he has the time to \nreact. To combat this, sociability and openness must not only be encour­\naged, they must be formally organized and channeled. \nThese conditions at Versailles lasted for Louis's entire reign, some fifty \nyears of relative peace and tranquillit y. Through it all, not a pin dropped \nwithout Louis hearing it. \nSolitude is dang erous to reason, without beingj avorable to virtue .... \nRemember that the solitary mortal is certainl y luxurious, \nprobabl y supers titious, and possibl y mad. \nDr. SamuelJohnson, 1709-1784 \nKEYS TO POWER \nMachiavelli makes the argument that in a strictly military sense a fortress is \ninvariably amistake. It becomes a symbol of power's isolation, and is an \neasy target for its builders' enemies. Designed to defend you, fortresses ac­\ntually cut you off from help and cut into your flexibility. They may appear \nimpregna ble, but once you retire to one, everyone knows where you are; \nand a siege does not have to succeed to turn your fortress into a prison. \nWith their small and confined spaces, fortresses are also extremely vulner­\nable to the plague and contagious diseases. In a strategic sense, the iso­\nlation of a fortress provides no protection, and actually creates more \nproblems than it solves. was made so near/y to \nresemb/e the counle­\nnanee ofa stiffened \ncorpse Ihal Ihe closest \nserutiny musl have had \ndijficu/ty in detecting \nIhe cheal.

To make yourself powerful you must place \nyourself at the center of things, as Louis XIV did at Versailles. All activity \nshould revolve around you, and you should be aware of everything hap­\npening on the street, and of anyone who might be hatching plots against \nyou. The danger for most people comes when they feel threatened. In such \ntimes they tend to retreat and elose ranks, to find security in a kind of \nfortress. In doing so, however, they come to rely for information on a \nsmaller and smaller cirele, and lose perspective on events around them. \nThey lose maneuverability and become easy targets, and their isolation \nmakes them paranoid. As in warfare and most games of strategy, isolation \noften precedes defeat and death. \nIn moments of uncertainty and danger, you need to fight this desire to \nturn inward. Instead, make yourself more accessible, seek out old allies and \nmake new ones, force yourself into more and more different cireles. This \nhas been the trick of powerful people for centuries. \nThe Roman statesman Cicero was born into the lower nobility, and \nhad little chance of power unless he managed to make a place for himself \namong the aristocrats who controlled the city. He succeeded brilliantly, \nidentifying everyone with influence and figuring out how they were con­\nnected to one another. He mingled everywh ere, knew everyon e, and had \nsuch a vast network of connections that an enemy here could easily be \ncounterb alanced by an ally there. \nThe French statesma n Talleyrand played the game the same way. Al­\nthough he came from one of the oldest aristocratic families in France, he \nmade a point of always staying in touch with what was happening in the \nstreets of Paris, allowing him to foresee trends and troubles. He even got a \ncertain pleasure out of mingling with shady criminal types, who supplied \nhim with valuable informat ion. Every time there was a crisis, a transition of \npower-the end of the Directory, the fall of Napoleon, the abdication of \nLouis XVIII-he was able to survive and even thrive, because he never \nelosed himself up in a small cirele but always forged connections with the \nneworder. \nThis law pertains to kings and queens, and to those of the highest \npower: The moment you lose contact with your people, seeking security in \nisolation, rebellion is brewing. Never imagine yourself so elevated that you \ncan afford to cut yourself off from even the lowest echelons. By retreating \nto a fortress, you make yourself an easy target for your plotting subjects, \nwho view your isolation as an insult and a reason for rebellion. \nSince humans are such social creature s, it follows that the social arts \nthat make us pleasant to be around can be practiced only by constant ex­\nposure and circulation. The more you are in contact with others, the more \ngraceful and at ease you become. Isolation, on the other hand, engenders \nan awkwa rdness in your gestures, and leads to further isolation, as people \nstart avoiding you. \nIn 1545 Duke Cosimo I de' Medici decided that to ensure the immor-\ntality of his name he would commission frescoes for the main chapel of the \nchurch of San Lorenzo in Florence. He had many great painters to choose \nfrom, and in the end he picked J acopo da Pontormo. Getting on in years, \nPontormo wanted to make these frescoes his chef d'oeuvre and legacy. His \nfirst decision was to elose the chapel off with walls, partitions, and blinds. \nHe wanted no one to witness the creation of his masterpiece, or to steal his \nideas. He would outdo Michelangelo hirns elf. When some young men \nbroke into the chapel out of curiosity, J acopo sealed it off even further. \nPontormo filled the chapel's ceiling with biblical scenes-the Creation, \nAdam and Eve, Noah's ark, on and on. At the top of the middle wall he \npainted Christ in his majesty, raising the dead on Judgment Day. The artist \nworked on the chapel for eleven years, rarely leaving it, since he had de­\nveloped a phobia for human contact and was afraid his ideas would be \nstolen. \nPontormo died before completing the frescoes, and none of them has \nsurvived. But the great Renaissance writer Vasari, a friend of Pontormo's \nwho saw the frescoes shortly after the artist's death, left adescription of \nwhat they looked like. There was a total lack of proportion. Scenes \nbumped against scenes, figures in one story being juxtaposed with those in \nanother, in maddening numbers. Pontormo had become obsessed with de­\ntail but had lost any sense of the overall composition. Vasari left off his de­\nscription of the frescoes by writing that if he continued, \"I think I would go \nmad and become entangled in this painting, just as I believe that in the \neleven years of time Jacopo spent on it, he entangled hirnself and anyone \nelse who saw it.\" 1nstead of crowning Pontormo's career, the work became \nhis undoing. \nThese frescoes were visual equivalents of the effects of isolation on the \nhuman mind: a loss of proportion, an obsession with detail combined with \nan inability to see the larger picture, a kind of extravagant ugliness that no \nlonger communicates. Clearly, isolation is as deadly for the creative arts as \nfor the social arts. Shakespeare is the most famous writer in history be­\ncause, as a dramatist for the popular stage, he opened hirns elf up to the \nmasses, making his work accessible to people no matter what their educa­\ntion and taste. Artists who hole themselves up in their fortress lose a sense \nof proportion, their work communicating only to their small circle. Such \nart remains comered and powerless. \nFinally, since power is a human creation, it is inevitably increased by \ncontact with other people. 1nstead of falling into the fortress mentality, \nview the world in the following manner: 1t is like a vast Versailles, with \nevery room communicating with another. You need to be permeable, able \nto float in and out of different circles and mix with different types. That \nkind of mobility and social contact will protect you from plotters, who will \nbe unable to keep secrets from you, and from YOUf enemies, who will be \nunable to isolate you from yoUf allies. Always on the move, you mix and \nmingle in the rooms of the palace, never sitting or settling in one place. No \nhunter can fix his aim on such a swift-moving creatu re. \nLAW 18 135 \n136 LAW 18 Image: The Fortress. High \nup on the hill, the citadel be­\ncomes a symbol of all that is \nhateful in power and authority. \nThe citizens of the town betray \nyou to the first enemy that comes. \nCut off from communication and in-\ntelligence, the citadel falls with ease. \nAuthority: A good and wise prince, desirous of maintaining that \ncharacter, and to avoid giving the opportunity to his sons to be­\ncome oppressive, will never build fortresses, so that they may \nplace their reliance upon the good will of their subjects, and not \nupon the strength of citadels. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527) \nREVERSAL \nIt is hardly ever right and propitious to choose isolation. Without keeping \nan ear on what is happening in the streets, you will be unable to protect \nYOUfself. About the only thing that constant human contact cannot facili­\ntate is thought. The weight of society's pressure to conform, and the lack of \ndistance from other people, can make it impossible to think clearly ahout \nwhat is going on around you. As a temporary reCOUfse, then, isolation can \nhelp you to gain perspective. Many a serious thinker has heen produced in \nprisons, where we have nothing to do but think. Machiavelli could write \nThe Prince only once he found hirnself in exile and isolated on a farm far \nfrom the political intrigues of Florence. \nThe danger is, however, that this kind of isolation will sire all kinds of \nstrange and perverted ideas. You may gain perspective on the larger pic­\nture, hut you lose a sense of your own smallness and limitations. Also, the \nmore isolated you are, the harder it is to break out of YOUf isolation when \nyou choose to-it sinks you deep into its quicksand without your noticing. \nIf you need time to think, then, choose isolation only as a last resort, and \nonly in small doses. Be careful to keep YOUf way hack into society open. \nLAW \n19 \nKNOW WH O YO U'R E \nDE ALING WITH-\nDO NO T OF FEN D THE \nWR ONG PERSON \nJDDGMENT \nThere are many different kinds of people in the wo rld, \nand you can neuer assume that eueryone will react to \nyour strategies in the same way.

The \nIndians were illegally \nburdened with great \nquantities of silver, and \na loeal offieial arrested \nAguirre, senteneing \nhim to reeeive two \nhundred lashes in heu \n0/ a fine for oppressing \nthe Indians. \"The \nsoldier Aguirre, having \nreceived a notifieation \nof the sentence, \nbesought Ihe aleaide \nthat, instead offiogging \nhim, he would put him \n10 dealh, for that he \nwas agentieman by \nbirth .... All this had \nno effeet on the aleaide, \nwho ordered the exeeu­\ntioner to hring a heast, \nand execute the \nsentence. The exeeu­\ntioner eame to the \n138 LAW 19 OPPON ENTS, SUC KERS, AND VICT IMS: Preliminary Typology \nIn your rise to power you will come across many breeds of opponent, \nsucker, and victim. The hig hest form of the art of power is the ability to dis­\ntinguish the wolves from the lambs, the foxes from the hares, the hawks \nfrom the vultures. If you make this distinction weIl, you will succeed with­\nout needing to coerce anyone too much . But if you deal blindly with \nwhomever crosses your path, you will have a life of constant sorrow, if you \neven live that long. Being able to recognize types of people, and to act ac­\ncordingly, is critical. The following are the five most dangerous and diffi­\ncult types of mark in the jungle, as identified by artists-con and \notherwise-of the past. \nThe Arrogant and Pro ud Man. Although he may initially disguise \nit, this man's touchy pride makes hirn very dangerous. Any perceived \nslight will lead to a vengeance of overwhelming violence . You may say to \nyourse lf, \"But I only said such-and-such at a party, where everyone was \ndrunk. ... \" It does not matter. There is no sanity behind his overreaction, \nso do not waste time trying to figure hirn out. If at any point in your deal­\nings with a person you sense an oversensitive and overactive pride, flee. \nWhatever you are hoping for from hirn isn't worth it. \nThe Hopelessly Insecure Man. This man is related to the proud and ar­\nrogant type, but is less violent and harder to spot. His ego is fragile, his \nsense of self insecure, and if he feels hirnself deceived or attacked, the hurt \nwill simmer. He will attack you in bites that will take forever to get big \nenough for you to notice. If you find you have deceived or harmed such a \nman, disappear for a long time. Do not stay around hirn or he will nibble \nyou to death. \nMr. Suspicion. Another variant on the breeds above, this is a future Joe \nStalin. He sees what he wants to see-usually the worst -in other people, \nand imag ines that everyone is after hirn. Mr. Suspicion is in fact the least \ndangerous of the three: Genuinely unbala nced, he is easy to deceive, just as \nStalin hirnself was constantly deceived. Play on his suspicious nature to get \nhirn to turn aga inst other people. But if you do become the target of his sus­\npicions, watch out. \nThe Serpent with a Long Memo ry. If hurt or deceived, this man will \nshow no anger on the surfac e; he will calculate and wait. Then, when he is \nin a position to turn the tables, he will exact a revenge marked by a cold­\nblooded shre wdness. Recognize this man by his calculation and cunning in \nthe different areas of his life. He is usually cold and unaff ectionate . Be dou­\nbly careful of this snake, and if you have somehow injured hirn, either \ncrush him completely or get hirn out of your sight. \nThe Plain, Unassuming, and Often Unintelligent Man. Ah, your ears \nprick up when you find such a tempting victim. But this man is a lot harder \nto deceive than you imagin e. Falling for a ruse often takes intelligence \nand imagination-a sense of the possible reward s. The blunt man will \nnot take the bait because he does not recognize it. He is that unaware. The \ndanger with this man is not that he will harm you or seek revenge, but \nrnerely that he will waste your time, energy, resources, and even your san­\nity in trying to deceive him. Have a test ready for a mark-a joke, a story. If \nhis re action is utterly literal, this is the type you are dealing with. Continue \nat your own risk. \nTRANSGRESSIONS OF THE LAW \nTransgression I \nIn the early part of the thirteenth century, Muhammad, the shah of \nKhwarezm, managed after many wars to forge a huge empire, extending \nwest to present-day Turkey and south to Mgh anistan. The empi re's center \nwas the great Asian capital of Samarka nd. The shah had a powernd, well­\ntrained army, and could mobilize 200,000 warriors within days. \nIn 1219 Muhammad received an embassy from a new tribal leader to \nthe east, Genghis Khan. The embassy included all sorts of gifts to the great \nMuhammad, representing the finest goods from Khan's small but growing \nMongoi empire. Genghis Khan wanted to reopen the Silk Route to Europe, \nand offered to share it with Muhamm ad, while promising peace between \nthe two empire s. \nMuhammad did not know this upstart from the east, who, it seemed to \nhirn, was extremely arrogant to try to talk as an equal to one so clearly his \nsuperior. He ignored Kha n's offer. Khan tried again: This time he sent a \ncaravan of a hundred camels filled with the rarest artic les he had plun­\ndered from China. Before the caravan reached Muhammad, however, \nInalchik, the govemor of a region bordering on Samarkand, seized it \nfor hirnself , and executed its leaders. \nGenghis Khan was sure that this was a mistake --that Inalchik had \nacted without Muha mmad' s approval. He sent yet another mission to \nMuhamm ad, reiterating his offer and asking that the govemor be puni shed. \nThis time Muhammad hirnself had one of the ambassadors beheaded, and \nsent the other two back with shaved heads-a horrifying insult in the Mon­\ngoI code of honor. Khan sent a message to the shah: \"You have chosen war. \nWhat will happen will happen, and what it is to be we know not; only God \nknows .\" Mobilizing his forces, in 1220 he attacked Inalchik's provin ce, \nwhere he seized the capital, captured the govemor, and ordered hirn exe­\ncuted by having molten silver poured into his eyes and ears. \nOver the next year, Khan led aseries of guerrilla-like campaigns \nagainst the shah's much larger army. His method was totally novel for the \ntirne-his soldiers could move very fast on horseback, and had mastered \nthe art of firing with bow and arrow while mount ed. The speed and flexi­\nbility of his forces allowed hirn to deceive Muhammad as to his intentions \nand the directions of his movements. Eventually he managed first to sur-prison, and put Aguirre \non the beast .... The \nbeast was driven on, \nand he received the \nlashes .... \" \nWhen freed, Aguirre \nannounced his inten­\ntion of killing the offi­\neiai who had sentenced \nhim, the aicalde \nEsquivel. Esquivel:, \nterm of office expired \nand he fled to Lima, \nthree hundred twenty \nleagues away, but \nwithin fifteen days \nAguirre had tracked \nhim there. The fright­\nenedjudgejourneyed \nto Quito, a trip of four \nhundred leagues, and in \ntwenty days Aguirre \narrived. \n\"When Esquivel heard \nof his presence, \" \naccording to Garcilaso, \n\"he made another jour­\nney offive hundred \nleagues to Cuzco; but \nin a few days Aguirre \nalso arrived, having \ntravelled on foot and \nwithout shoes, saying \nthat a whipped man \nhas no business to ride \na horse, or to go where \nhe would be seen by \nothers. In this way, \nAguirre followed his \njudge for three years, \nand four months.\" \nWearying of the \npursuit, Esquivei \nremained at Cuzco, a \ncity so stemly govemed \nthat he feit he would be \nsafe from Aguirre. He \ntook a house near the \ncathedral and never \nventured outdoors \nwithout a sword and a \ndagger. \"However, on a \ncertain Monday, at \nnoon, Aguirre entered \nhis house, and having \nwalked all over it, and \nhaving traversed a \ncorridor, a saloon, a \nchamber , and an inner \nLAW 19 139 \nchamber where Ihe \njudge kepl his books, \nhe al last found him \nasleep over one of his \nbooks, and stabbed him \n10 death. The murderer \nthen went out, but \nwhen he came to the \ndoor of the house, he \nfound that he had \nforgotten his hat, and \nhad the temerity to \nreturn and fetch it, and \nthen walked down \nthe street.\" \nTHE GüLDEN DREAM: \nSEEKERS OF EL DORADO, \nWALKER CHAPMAN, \n1967 \nTIIE CHO\\\\ A'iD \nTBE SIH:r ·:p \nA troublesome Crow \nseated herself on the \nback of a Sheep.

Muhammad fled, and a year later died, \nhis vast empire broken and destroyed, Genghis Khan was sole master of \nSamarkand, the Silk Route, and most of northern Asia. \nInterpretation \nNever assurne that the person you are dealing with is weaker or less impor­\ntant than you are. Some men are slow to take offense, which may make \nyou misjudge the thickness of their skin, and fail to worry about insulting \nthem. But should you offend their honor and their pride, they will over­\nwhelm you with a violence that seems sudden and extreme given their \nslowness to anger. If you want to turn people down, it is best to do so po­\nlitely and respectfully, even if you feel their request is impudent or their \noffer ridiculous. Never reject them with an insult until you know them bet­\nter; you may be dealing with a Genghis Khan. \nTransgression II \nIn the late 1910s some of the best swindlers in America fo rmed a con-artist \nring based in Denver, Colorado . In the winter months they would spread \nacross the southern states, plying their trade. In 1920 Joe Furey, aleader of \nthe ring, was working his way through Texas, making hundreds of thou­\nsands of dollars with classic con games. In Fort Worth, he met a sucker \nnamed J. Frank Norfleet, a cattleman who owned a large ranch. Norfleet \nfell for the con. Convinced of the riches to come, he emptied his bank ac­\ncount of $45,000 and handed it over to Furey and his confederate s. A few \ndays later they gave him his \"millions ,\" which tumed out to be a few good \ndollars wrapped around a packet of newspaper clippings . \nFurey and his men had worked such cons a hundred times before, and \nthe sucker was usually so embarrassed by his gullibility that he quietly \nleamed his lesson and accepted the loss. But Norfleet was not like other \nsuckers. He went to the police, who told hirn there was little they could do. \n\"Then 1'11 go after those people myself,\" Norfleet told the detectives. \"1'11 \nget them, too, if it takes the rest of my life.\" His wife took over the ranch as \nNorfleet scoured the country, looking for others who had been fleeced in \nthe same game. One such sucker came forward, and the two men identified \none of the con artists in San Francisco, and managed to get hirn locked up. \nThe man committed suicide rather than face a long term in prison. \nNorfleet kept going. He tracked down another of the con artists in \nMontana, roped him like a calf, and dragged hirn through the muddy streets \nto the town jail. He traveled not only across the country but to England, \nCanada, and Mexico in search of Joe Furey, and also of Furey's right-hand \nman, W B. Spencer. Finding Spencer in Montreal, Norfleet chased him \nthrough the streets. Spencer escaped but the rancher stayed on his trail and \ncaught up with him in Salt Lake City. Preferring the mercy of the law to \nNorfleet's wrath, Spencer turned hirnself in. \nNorfleet found Furey in Jacksonville, Florida, and personally hauled \nhim off to face justice in Texas. But he wouldn't stop there: He continued \non to Denver, determined to break up the entire ring. Spending not only \nlarge sums of money but another year of his life in the pursuit, he managed \nto put all of the con ring's leaders behind bars. Even some he didn't catch \nhad grown so terrified of hirn that they too turned themselves in. \nAfter five years of hunting, Norfleet had single-handedly destroyed the \neountry's largest confederation of con artists. The effort bankrupted hirn \nand ruined his marriage, but he died a satisfied man. \nInterpretation \nMost men accept the humiliation of being conned with a sense of resigna­\ntion. They leam their lesson, recognizing that there is no such thing as a \nfree lunch, and that they have usually been brought down by their own \ngreed for easy money. Some, however, refuse to take their medicine. In­\nstead of reflecting on their own gullibility and avarice, they see themselves \nas totally innocent victims. \nMen like this may seem to be crusaders for justice and honesty, but \nthey are actually immoderately insecure. Being fooled, being conned, has \nactivated their self-doubt, and they are desperate to repair the damage. \nWere the mortgage on Norfleet's ranch, the collapse of his marriage, and \nthe years of borrowing money and living in cheap hotels worth his revenge \nover his embarras sment at being fleeced? To the Norfleets of the world , \novercoming their embarrassment is worth any price. \nAll people have insecurities, and often the best way to deceive a sucker \nis to play upon his insecurities. But in the realm of power, everything is a \nquestion of degree, and the person who is decidedly more insecure than \nthe average mortal presents great dangers. Be wamed: If you practice de­\neeption or trickery of any sort, study your mark weIl. Some people's inse­\neurity and ego fragility cannot tolerate the slightest offense. To see if you \nare dealing with such a type, test them first-make, say, a mild joke at their \nexpense. A confident person williaugh; an overly insecure one will react as \nif personally insulted. If you suspect you are dealing with this type, find an­\nother victim. \nTransgression III \nIn the fifth century B.C., Ch'ung-erh, the prince of Ch'in (in present-day \nChina), had been forced into exile. He lived modestly- even, sometimes, \nin poverty-wai ting for the time when he could return horne and resurne \nhis princely life. Once he was passing through the state of Cheng, where \nthe mler, not knowing who he was, treated hirn rudely. The ruler's minis­\nter, Shu Chan, saw this and said, \"This man is a worthy prince. May Your \nHighness treat hirn with great courtesy and thereby place hirn under an \nobligation!\" But the ruler, able to see only the prince's lowly station, ig­\nnored this advice and insulted the prince again. Shu Chan again warned \nhis master, saying, \"If Your Highness cannot treat Ch'ung-erh with cour­\ntesy, you should put hirn to death, to avoid calamity in the future.\" The \nmler only scoffed. \nYears later, the prince was finally able to return horne, his circum­\nstances greatly changed. He did not forget who had been kind to hirn, and \nLAW 19 141 \n142 LAW 19 who had been insolent, during his years of poverty. Least of a1l did he for­\nget his treatment at the hands of the ruler of Cheng. At his first opportunity \nhe assembled a vast army and marched on Cheng, taking eight eities, de­\nstroying the kingdom, and sending the ruler into an exile of his own. \nInterpretation \nYou can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of litde im­\nportance and me ans today can be a person of power tomorrow. We forget \na lot in our lives, but we rarely forget an insult \nHow was the ruler of Cheng to know that Prince Ch'ung-erh was an \nambitious, calculating, cunning type, a serpent with a long memory ? There \nwas really no way for him to know, you may say-but since there was no \nway, it would have been better not to tempt the fates by finding out. There \nis nothing to be gained by insulting a person unneces sarily. Swa1low the \nimpulse to offend, even if the other person seems weak. The satisfaction is \nmeager compared to the danger that someday he or she will be in a posi­\ntion to hurt you. \nTransgression IV \nThe year of 1920 had been a particularly bad one for American art dealers. \nBig buyers-the robber-baron generation of the previous century- were \ngetting to an age where they were dying off like flies, and no new rnillion­\naires had emerged to take their place. Things were so bad that a number of \nthe major dealers decided to pool their resources, an unheard- of event, \nsince art dealers usually get along like cats and dogs. \nJoseph Duveen, art dealer to the richest tycoons of America, was suf­\nfering more than the others that year, so he deeided to go along with this \nalliance. The group now consisted of the five biggest dealers in the country. \nLooking around for a new client, they deeided that their last best hope was \nHenry Ford, then the wealthiest man in America. Ford had yet to venture \ninto the art market, and he was such a big target that it made sense for them \nto work together . \nThe dealers deeided to assemble a list, \"The 100 Greatest Paintings in \nthe World\" (a1l of which they happened to have in stock) , and to offer the \nlot of them to Ford. With one purchase he could make himself the world's \ngreatest collector. The consortium worked for weeks to produce a magnifi­\ncent object: a three-volume set of books containing beautiful reproductions \nof the paintings, as well as scholarly texts accompanying each picture. Next \nthey made a personal visit to Ford at his home in Dearbom, Michigan. \nThere they were surprised by the simplicity of his house: Mr. Ford was ob­\nviously an extremely unaffected man. \nFord received them in his study. Looking through the book, he ex­\npressed astonishment and delight. The exeited dealers began imagining the \nmillions of dollars that would short1y flow into their coffers. Fina1ly, how­\never, Ford looked up from the book and said, \"Gendemen, beautiful books \nlike these, with beautiful colored pictures like these, must cost an awful \nlot!\" \"But Mr. Ford!\" exclaimed Duveen, \"we don't expect you to buy these \nbooks. We got them up especially for you, to show you the pietures. These \nbooks are a present to you.\" Ford seemed puzzled. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \n\"it is extremely nice of you, but I really don't see how I can accept a beau­\ntiful, expensive present like this from strangers.\" Duveen explained to Ford \nthat the reproductions in the books showed paintings they had hoped to \nseIl to hirn. Ford finally underst ood. \"But gent lemen,\" he exclaimed, \"what \nwould I want with the original pietures when the ones right here in these \nbooks are so beautiful?\" \nInterpretation \nJoseph Duveen prided hirnself on studying his victims and clients in ad­\nvance, figuring out their weaknesses and the peculiarities of their tastes be­\nfore he ever met them. He was driven by desperation to drop this tactic just \nonce, in his assault on Henry Ford. It took hirn months to recover from his \nmisjudgment, both mentally and mone tarily. Ford was the unassuming \nplain-man type who just isn't worth the bother. He was the incarnation of \nthose literal-minded folk who do not possess enough imagina tion to be de­\neeived. From then on, Duveen saved his energies for the Mellons and Mor­\ngans of the world-men crafty enough for hirn to entrap in his snares. \nKEYS TO POWER \nThe ability to meaSUfe people and to know who you're dealing with is the \nmost important skill of all in gathering and conserving power. Without it \nyou are blind: Not only will you off end the wrong people, you will choose \nthe wrong types to work on, and will think you are flattering people when \nyou are actually insulting them. Before embarking on any move, take the \nmeasure of YOUf mark or potential opponent. Otherwise you will waste \ntime and make mistake s. Study people's weaknesses, the chinks in their \nannor, their areas ofboth pride and insecurity. Know their ins and outs be­\nfore you even decide whether or not to deal with them. \nTwo final words of caution : First, in judging and measuring your oppo­\nnent, never rely on your instinct s. You will make the greatest mistakes of all \nif you rely on such inexact indicat ors. Nothing can substitute for gathering \neonerete knowledge. Study and spy on YOUf opponent for however long it \ntakes; this will pay off in the long run. \nSecond, never trust appearances. Anyone with a serpent's heart can \nuse a show of kindness to cloak it; a person who is blustery on the outside is \noften really a coward. Leam to see through appearances and their contra­\nc1ietions. Never trust the version that people give of themselves -it is ut­\nterly unrelia ble. \nLAW 19 143 \n144 LAW 19 REVERSAL Image: The Hunter. He does not lay the \nsame trap for a wolf as for a fox. He does \nnot set bait where no one will take it. \nHe knows his prey thoroughly, its habits \nand hideaways, and hunts aeeordingly. \nAuthority: Be eonvineed, that there are no \npersons so insignifieant and ineonsiderable, \nbut may, some time or other, have it in their \npower to be of use to you; whieh they eer­\ntainly will not, if you have onee shown them \neontempt. Wrongs are often forgiven, but \neontempt never iso Our pride remembers \nit for ever. (Lord Chesterfield, 1694-1773) \nWhat possible good ean eome from ignoranee ab out other people? Learn \nto tell the Hons from the lambs or pay the priee. Obey this law to its fullest \nextent; it has no reversal -do not bother looking for one. \nLAW \n20 \nDO NO T CO MM IT \nTO ANYONE \nJUDGMENT \nIt is the fool who always rushes to take sides. Do not com­\nmit to any side or cause but yourself. By maintaining \nyour independence, you become the master of others­\nplaying people against one another, making them \npursueyou. \n145 \n146 LAW 20 PART I: DO NO T COMMI T TO ANYO NE, \nBU T BE COUR TED BY ALL \nIf you allow people to feel they possess you to any degree, you lose all power \nover them. By not committing your affections, they will only try harder to \nwin you over. Stay aloof and you gain the power that comes from their at­\ntention and Jrustrated desire. Play the Virgin Queen: Give them hope but \nnever satisfaction. \nOBSER VA NC E OF THE LAW \nWhen Queen Elizabeth I ascended the throne of England, in 1558, there \nwas much to-do about her finding a husband. The issue was debated in Par­\nliament, and was a main topic of conversation among Englishmen of all \nclasses; they often disag reed as to whom she should marry, but everyone \nthought she should marry as soon as possible, for a queen must have a \nking, and must bear heirs for the kingdom. The debates raged on for years. \nMeanwhile the most handsome and eligi ble bachelors in the re alm-Sir \nRobert Dudley, the Earl of Essex, Sir Wal ter Raleigh- vied for Eliza beth's \nhand. She did not discourage them, but she seemed to be in no hurry, and \nher hints as to which man might be her favorite often contradicted each \nother. In 1566, Parliament sent adelegation to Eliza beth urging her to \nmarry before she was too old to bear children. She did not argue, nor did \nshe discourage the delegation, but she remain ed a virgin nonetheless. \nThe delicate game that Eliza beth played with her suitors slowly made \nher the subj ect of innumerable sexual fanta sies and the ob ject of cultish \nworship. The court physician, Simon Forman, used his diary to describe \nhis dreams of deflowering her. Painters represented her as Diana and other \ngoddesses. The poet Edmund Spenser a'\"'d others wrote eulogies to the Vir­\ngin Queen. She was referred to as \"thc world' s Emp resse,\" \"that virtuous \nVirgo\" who rules the world and sets the stars in motion. In conversa tion \nwith her, her many male suitors would employ bold sexual innuendo, a \ndare that Elizabeth did not discourage . She did an she could to stir their in­\nterest and simultaneously keep them at bay. \nThroughout Europe, kings and princes knew that a marriage with Eliz­\nabeth would seal an alliance between England and any nation. The king of \nSpain wooed her, as did the prince of Sweden and the archduke of Austria. \nShe politely refu sed them alt \nThe great diplomatie issue of Eliza beth's day was posed by the revolt \nof the Flemish and Dutch Lowlands, which were then possess ions of Spain. \nShould England break its alliance with Spain and choose France as its main \nally on the Continent, thereby encouraging Flemish and Dutch indepen­\ndence? By 1570 it had come to seem that an alliance with France would be \nEngla nd's wisest course. France had two eligible men of noble blood, the \ndukes of Anjou and Alenc;on, brothers of the French king. Wo uld either of \nthem marry Eliza beth? Both had advantages, and Elizabeth kept the hopes \nof both alive. The issue simm ered for years. The duke of Anjou made sev-\neral visits to England, kissed Elizabeth in public, even called her by pet \nnames; she appeared to requite his affections. Meanw hile, as she flirted \nwith the two brothers, a treaty was signed that sealed peace between \nFrance and England. By 1582 Elizabeth feit she could break off the \ncourtsh ip. In the case of the duke of Anjou in particular, she did so with \ngreat relief: For the sake of diplomacy she had aHowed herself to be \ncourted by a man whose presence she could not stand and whom she \nfound physically repulsive. Once peace between France and England was \nsecure, she dropped the unctuous duke as politely as she could. \nBy this time Elizabeth was too old to bear children. She was accord­\ningly able to live the rest of her life as she desired, and she died the Vrrgin \nQueen. She left no direct heir, but mIed through aperiod of incomparable \npeace and cultural fertility. \nInterpretation \nElizabeth had good reason not to marry: She had witnessed the mistakes of \nMary Queen of Scots, her cousin. Resisting the idea of being mIed by a \nwoman, the Scots expected Mary to marry and marry wisely. To wed a for­\neigner would be unpopular; to favor any particular noble house would \nopen up terrible rivalrie s. In the end Mary chose Lord Damley, a Catholic. \nIn doing so she incurred the wrath of Scotland's Protestants, and endless \nturmoil ensued. \nElizabeth knew that marriage can often lead to a female mler's undo­\ning: By marrying and committing to an alliance with one party or nation, \nthe queen becomes embroiled in conflicts that are not of her choosing, con­\nfliets which may eventually overwhelm her or lead her into a futile war. \nAlso, the husband becomes the de facto mler, and often tries to do away \nwith his wife the queen, as Damley tried to get rid of Mary. Elizabeth \nlearned the lesson weH. She had two goals as amier: to a--oid marriage and \nto avoid war. She managed to combine these goals by t....:ngling the possi­\nbility of marriage in order to forge alliances. The moment she committed \nto any single suitor would have been the moment she lost her power. She \nhad to emanate mystery and desirability, never discouraging anyone's \nhopes but never yielding. \nThrough this lifelong game of flirting and withdrawing, Elizabeth \ndominated the country and every man who sought to conquer her. As the \ncenter of attention, she was in contro!. Keeping her independence above \nall, Elizabeth protected her power and made herself an object of worship . \nI would rather be a beggar and single than a queen and married. \nQueen Elizabeth I, 1533-1 603 \nKEYS TO POWER \nSince power depends greatly on appeara nces, you must leam the tricks \nthat will enhance your image. Refusing to commit to a person or group is \none of these. When you hold yourself back, you incur not anger but a kind \nLAW 20 147 \n148 LAW 20 of respect. You instantly seem powerful because you make yourself un­\ngrasp able, rather than succumbing to the group, or to the relationship, as \nmost people do. This aura of power only grows with time: As your reputa­\ntion for independence grows, more and more people will come to desire \nyou, wanting to be the one who gets you to commit. Desire is like a virus: If \nwe see that someone is desired by other people, we tend to find this person \ndesirable too. \nThe moment you commit, the magic is gone. You become like every­\none else. People will try all kinds of underhanded methods to get you to \ncommit. They will give you gifts, shower you with favors, all to put you \nunder obligation. Encourage the attention, stimulate their interest, but do \nnot commit at any cost. Accept the gifts and favors if you so desire, but be \ncareful to maintain your inner aloofne ss. You cannot inadvertently allow \nyourself to feel obligated to anyone. \nRemember, though : The goal is not to put people off, or to make it seem \nthat you are incapable of commitment. Uke the Virgin Queen, you need to \nstir the pot, excite interest, lure people with the possibility of having you. \nYou have to bend to their attention occasionally, then-but never too far. \nThe Greek soldier and statesman Alcibiades played this game to per­\nfection. It was Alcibiades who inspired and led the massive Athenian ar­\nmada that invaded Sicily in 414 B.C. When envious Athenians back horne \ntried to bring hirn down by accusing hirn of trumped-up charge s, he de­\nfected to the enemy, the Spartan s, instead of facing a trial back horne. Then, \nafter the Athenians were defeated at Syracu se, he left Sparta for Persia, even \nthough the power of Sparta was now on the rise. Now, however, both the \nAthenians and the Spartans courted Alcibiades because of his influ ence \nwith the Persia ns; and the Per lans showered hirn with honors because of \nhis power over the Athenians and the Sparta ns. He made promises to every \nside but committed to none, and in the end he held all the cards. \nIf you aspire to power and influ ence, try the Alcibiades tactic: Put \nyourself in the middle between competing powers. Lure one side with the \npromise of your help; the other side, always wanting to outdo its enemy, \nwill pursue you as weIl. As each side vies for your attention, you will im­\nmediately seem a person of great influ ence and desira bility. More power \nwill accrue to you than if you had rashly committed to one side. To perfect \nthis tactic you need to keep yourself inwardly free from emotional entan­\nglements, and to view all those around you as pawns in your rise to the top. \nYou cannot let yourself become the lackey for any caus e. \nIn the midst of the 1968 U.S. presidential election, Henry Kissinger \nmade a phone call to Richard Nixon's team. Kissinger had been allied with \nNelson RockefeIler, who had unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomina­\ntion. Now Kissinger offered to supply the Nixon camp with valuable inside \ninformation on the negotiations for peace in Vietnam that were then going \non in Paris. He had a man on the negotiating team keeping rum informed of \nthe latest developments. The Nixon team gladly accepted his offer. \nAt the same time, however, Kissinger also approached the Democratic \nnominee, Hubert Humphrey, and offered his aid. The Humphrey people \nasked hirn for inside information on Nixon and he supplied it. \"Look,\" \nKissinger told Humphrey's people, \"I've hated Nixon for years.\" In fact he \nhad no interest in either side. What he really wanted was what he got: the \npromise of a high-level cabinet post from both Nixon and Humphrey. \nWhichever man won the election, Kissinger's career was secure. \nThe winner, of course, was Nixon, and Kissinger duly went on to his \ncabinet post. Even so, he was careful never to appear too much of a Nixon \nman. When Nixon was reelected in 1972, men much more loyal to hirn \nthan Kissinger were fired. Kissinger was also the only Nixon high official to \nsurvive Watergate and serve under the next president, Gerald Ford. By \nmaintaining a little distance he thrived in turbulent times. \nThose who use this strategy often notice a strange phenomenon: \nPeople who rush to the support of others tend to gain little respect in the \nprocess, for their help is so easily obtained, while those who stand back \nfind themselves besieged with supplicants. Their aloofness is powerful, and \neveryone wants them on their side. \nWhen Picasso, after early years of poverty, had become the most suc­\ncessful artist in the world, he did not commit hirnself to this dealer or that \ndealer, although they now besieged hirn from all sides with attractive offers \nand grand promises. Instead, he appeared to have no interest in their ser­\nvices; this technique drove them wild, and as they fought over hirn his \nprices only rose. When Henry Kissinger, as U.S. secretary of state, wanted \nto re ach dHente with the Soviet Union, he made no concessions or concil­\niatory gestures, but courted China instead. This infuriated and also scared \nthe Soviets-they were already politica 11y isolated and feared further isola­\ntion if the United States and China_came together. Kissinger's move \npushed them to the negotiating table. The tactic has a parallel in seduction: \nWhen you want to seduce a woman, Stendhal advises, court her sister first. \nStay aloof and people will come to you. It will become achalienge for \nthem to win your affections. As long as you imitate the wise Virgin Queen \nand stimulate their hopes, you will remain a magnet of attention and desire. \nImage: \nThe Virgin Queen. \nThe center of attention, \ndesire, and worship. Never \nsuccumbing to one suitor or the \nother, the Virgin Queen keeps \nthemall revolving around \nher Iike planets, unable to \nIeave her orbit but never \ngetting any eloser \nto her.

Hover­\ning above their strugg les were the nations of Fran ce and Spain, ready to \ngrab whatever they could from the weakened Italian powers. And trapped \nin the middle was the small state of Mantua, role d by the young Duke \nGianfra ncesco Gonzaga. Mantua was strategically located in northern \nItaly, and it seemed only a matter of time before one of the powers swal­\nlowed it up and it ceased to exist as an independent king dom. \nGonzaga was a fierce warrior and a skilled commander of tro ops, and \nhe became a kind of mercenary general for whatever side paid hirn best. In \nthe year 1490, he married Isabella d'Este, daughter of the roler of another \nsmall Italian duchy, Ferrara. Since he now spent most of his time away \nfron Mantua, it fell to Isabella to rule in his stead. \nIsabella' s first true test as roler came in 1498, when King Louis XII of \nFrance was preparing armies to attack Milan. In their usual perfidious fash­\nion, the Italian states immediately looked for ways to profit from Mila n's \ndifficult ies. Pope Alexander VI promised not to intervene, thereby giving \nthe French carte blanche . The Venetians signaled that they would not help \nMilan, either-and in exchange for this, they hoped the French would give \nthem Mantua. The roler of Milan, Lodovico Sforza, suddenly found him­\nself alone and aband oned. He turned to Isabella d'Este, one of his dosest \nfriends (also ro mored to be his lover ), and begged her to persuade Duke \nGonzaga to come to his aid. Isabella tried, but her husband balked, for he \nsaw Sforza's cause as hopeless. And so, in 1499, Louis swooped down on \nMilan and took it with ease. \nIsabella now faced a dilemma: If she stayed loyal to Lodovico, the \nFrench would now move against her. But if, instead, she allied herself with \nFrance, she would make enemies elsewhere in Italy, compromising Man­\ntua once Louis eventually withdrew. And if she looked to Venice or Rome \nfor help, they would simply swallow up Mantua under the doak of coming \nto her aid. Yet she had to do something. The mighty king of France was \nbrea thing down her neck: She decided to befriend him, as she had be­\nfriended Lodovico Sforza before him-with alluring gifts, witty, intelligent \nletters, and the pos sibility of her company, for Isabella was fam ous as a \nwoman of incomparable bea uty and charm. \nIn 1500 Louis invited Isabella to a great party in Milan to celebrate his \nvictory. Leonardo da Vinci built an enormous mechanical lion for the af­\nfair: When the lion opened its mouth, it spewed fresh lilies, the symbols of \nFrench royalty. At the party Isabella wore one of her celebrated dresses \n(she had by far the largest wardrobe of any of the Italian princesses), and \njust as she had hoped, she charmed and captivated Louis, who ignored all \nthe other ladies vying for his attention. She so on became his constant com­\npanion, and in exchange for her friendship he pledged to protect Mantua's \nindependence from Venice. \nAs one danger receded, however, another, more worrying one arose, \nthis time from the south, in the form of Cesare Borgia. Starting in 1500, \nBorgia had marched steadily northward, gobbling up all the small king­\ndoms in his path in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. Isabella under­\nstood Cesare perfectly: He could be neither trusted nor in any way \noffended. He had to be cajoled and kept at arm's length. Isabella began by \nsending hirn gifts-falcons, prize dogs, perfumes, and dozens of masks, \nwhich she knew he always wore when he walked the streets of Rome. She \nsent messengers with flattering greetings (although these messengers also \nacted as her spies). At one point Cesare asked if he could house some \ntroops in Mantua; Isabella managed to dissuade hirn politely, knowing full \nweIl that once the troops were quartered in the city, they would never \nleave. \nEven while Isabella was charming Cesare, she convinced everyone \naround her to take care never to utter a harsh word about hirn, since he \nhad spies everywhere and would use the slightest pretext for invasion. \nWhen Isabella had a child, she asked Cesare to be the godfather. She even \ndangled in front of hirn the possibility of a marriage between her family \nand his. Somehow it all worked, for although elsewhere he seized every­\nthing in his path, he spared Mantua. \nIn 1503 Cesare's father, Alexander, died, and a few years later the new \npope, Julius 11, went to war to drive the French troops from Italy. When \nthe mler of Ferrara-Alf onso, Isabella's brother-si ded with the French, \nJulius decided to attack and humble hirn. Once again Isabella found herself \nin the middle: the pope on one side, the French and her brother on the \nother. She dared not ally herself with either, but to off end either would be \nequally disastrous. Again she played the double game at which she had be­\ncome so expert. On the one hand she got her husband Gonzaga to fight for \nthe pope, knowing he would not fight very hard. On the other she let \nFrench troops pass through Mantua to come to Ferrara's aid. While she \npublidy complained that the French had \"invaded\" her territory, she pri­\nvately supplied them with valuable information. To make the invasion \nplausible to Julius, she even had the French pretend to plunder Mantua. It \nworked once again: The pope left Mantua alone. \nIn 1513, after a lengthy siege, Julius defeated Ferrara, and the French \ntroops withdrew. Worn out by the effort, the pope died a few months later. \nWith his death, the nightrnarish cyde of battles and petty squabbles began \nto repeat itself. leisurely feeding on the \ndead kites and crows. \nand then left the place \nhaie and hearty, \nobserving, \"The weak \nbenefit by the quarrels \nofthe mighty.\" \nINDIAN FABLES \nMen of great abi!ities \nare slow to aet, for it is \neasier to avoid oeea­\nsions for committing \nyourself than to come \nweil out of a commit­\nment.

THE smr \nAn eagle built a nest on \na tree, and hatched out \nsome eaglets. And a \nwild sow brought her \nlitter under the tree. \nThe eagle used to fly \noff after her prey, and \nbring it back to her \nyoung. And the sow \nrooted around the tree \nand hunted in the \nwoods, and when night \ncame she would bring \nher young something \nto eat. \nAnd the eagle and the \nsow lived in neighbo rly \nfashion. And a \ngrimalkin laid her \nplans to destroy the \neaglets and the little \nsucking pigs. She went \nto the eagle, and said: \n\"Eagle, you had better \nnot fly very far away. \nBeware of the sow; she \nis planning an evil \ndesign. She is going to \nundermine the roots of \nthe tree. You see she is \nrooting all the time.\" \nThen the grimalkin \nwent to the sow and \nsaid: \"Sow, you have \nnot a good neighbor . \nLast evening I heard \nthe eagle saying to her \neaglets: ' My dear little \neaglets, I am going to \ntreat you to a nice little \npig. lust as soon as the \nsow is gone, I will bring \nyou a little young \nsucking pig.' \" \nFrom that time the \neagle ceased to jiy out \nafter prey, and the sow \ndid not go any more \ninto the forest. The \neaglets and the young \npigs perished of starva­\ntion, and grimalkin \nfeasted on them. \nFABLES, \nLEO TOLSTOY, \n1828-1910 \n152 LAW 20 A great deal changed in ltaly during Isabella's reign: Popes came and \nwent, Cesare Borgia rose and then fell, Venice lost its empire, Milan was in­\nvaded, Florence fell into decline, and Rome was sacked by the Hapsburg \nEmperor Charles V. Through all this, tiny Mantua not only survived but \nthrived, its court the envy of Italy. Its wealth and soverei gnty would remain \nintact for a century after Isabella's death, in 1539. \nInterpretation \nIsabella d'Este understood Italy 's political situation with amazing clarity: \nOnce you took the side of any of the forces in the field, you were doomed. \nThe powerful would take you over, the weak would wear you down. Any \nnew alliance would lead to a new enemy, and as this cycle stirred up more \nconflict, other forces would be dragge d in, until you could no longer extri­\ncate yourself. Eventually you would collapse from exhausti on. \nIsabella steered her kingdom on the only course that would bring her \nsafely through . She would not allow herself to lose her head through loy­\nalty to a duke or a king. Nor would she try to stop the conflict that raged \naround her-that would only drag her into it. And in any case the conflict \nwas to her advantage . If the various parties were fighting to the death, and \nexhausting themselves in the process, they were in no position to gobble \nup Mantua. The source of Isabella's power was her clever ability to seem \ninterested in the affai rs and interests of each side, while actually commit­\nting to no one but herself and her kingd om. \nOnce you step into a fight that is not of your own choosing, you lose all \ninitiativ e. The comba tants' interests become your interests; you become \ntheir tool. Leam to control yourself , to restrain your natural tendency to \ntake sides and join the fight. Be friendly and charming to each of the com­\nbatants, then step back as they collide. With every battle they grow weaker, \nwhile you grow stronger with every battle you avoid. \nWhen the sni pe and the mussel struggle, the fisherman gets the benefit. \nAncient Chinese saying \nKEYS TO POWER \nTo succeed in the game of power, you have to master your emotions. But \neven if you succeed in gaining such self-control, you can never control the \ntemperamental dispositions of those around you. And this presents a great \ndanger. Most people operate in a whirlp ool of emotions, constantly react­\ning, chuming up squabbles and conflicts. Your self-control and autonomy \nwill only bother and infuriate them. They will try to draw you into the \nwhir lpool, begging you to take sides in their endless battl es, or to make \npeace for them. If you succumb to their emotional entreaties, little by little \nyou will find your mind and time occupied by tkeir problems. Do not allow \nwhatever compassion and pity you possess to suck you in. You can never \nwin in this game; the conflicts can only multiply. \nOn the other hand, you cannot completely stand aside, for that would \ncause needless offense. To play the game properly, you must seem inter­\nested in other people's problems, even sometimes appear to take their side. \nBut while you make outward gestures of support, you must maintain your \ninner energy and sanity by keeping your emotions disengaged. No matter \nhow hard people try to puH you in, never let your interest in their affairs \nand petty squabbles go beyond the surface. Give them gifts, listen with a \nsympathetic look, even occasionally play the charmer-b ut inwardly keep \nboth the friendly kings and the perfidious Borgias at arm's length. By refus­\ning to commit and thus maintaining your autonomy you retain the initia­\ntive: Your moves stay matters of your own choosing, not defensive \nreactions to the push-and-puH of those around you. \nSlowness to pick up your weapons can be a weapon itself, especia lly if \nyou let other people exhaust themselves fighting, then take advantage of \ntheir exhaustion. In ancient China, the kingdom of Chin once invaded the \nkingdom of Hsing. Huan, the ruler of a nearby province, thought he \nshould rush to Hsing's defense, but his adviser counseled hirn to wait: \n\"Hsing is not yet going to ruin,\" he said, \"and Chin is not yet exhausted. If \nehin is not exhausted, [we] cannot become very influenti al. Moreover, the \nmerit of supporting astate in danger is not as great as the virtue of reviving \na ruined one.\" The adviser's argument won the day, and as he had pre­\ndicted, Huan later had the glory both of rescuing Hsing from the brink of \ndestruction and then of conquering an exhausted Chin. He stayed out of \nthe fighting until the forces engaged in it had worn each other down, at \nwhich point it was safe for hirn to intervene. \nThat is what holding back from the fray allows you: time to position \nyourself to take advantage of the situation once one side starts to lose. You \ncan also take the game a step further, by promising your support to both \nsides in a conflict while maneuvering so that the one to come out ahead in \nthe struggle is you. This was what Castruccio Castracani, ruler of the Italian \ntown of Lucca in the fourteenth century, did when he had designs on the \ntown of Pistoia. A siege would have been expensive, costing both lives and \nmoney, but Castruccio knew that Pistoia contained two riyal factions, the \nBlacks and the Whites, which hated one another. He negotiated with the \nBlacks, promising to help them against the Whites; then, without their \nknowledge, he promised the Whites he would help them against the \nBlacks. And Castruccio kept his promises-he sent an army to a Black­\ncontrolled gate to the city, which the sentries of course welcomed in. \nMeanwhile another of his armies entered through a White-controHed gate. \nThe two armies united in the middle, occupied the town, kiHed the leaders \nofboth factions, ended the internal war, and took Pistoia for Castruc cio. \nPreserving your autonomy gives you options when people come to \nblows-y ou can play the mediator, broker the peace, while really securing \nYOUT own interests. You can pledge support to one side and the other may \nhave to court you with a higher bid. ür, like Castr uccio, you can appear to \ntake both sides, then play the antagonists against each other. \nOftentimes when a conflict breaks out, you are tempted to side with \nthe stronger party, or the one that offers you apparent advantage s in an al-THE PRICE OF EI'\\YY \nWhile a poor woman \nstood in the market­\nplace selling cheeses, a \ncat came along and \ncarried off a cheese.

Gesturing for the man to keep quiet, Talleyrand replied, \"Not a \nword! 1'11 tell you who we are tomorrow. \" He well knew that only fools \nrush into a situation -that by committing too quickly you lose your ma­\nneuverability. People also respect you less: Perhaps tomorrow, they think, \nyou will commit to another, different cause, since you gave YOUfself so eas­\nily to this one. Good fortune is a fickle god and will often pass from one \nside to the other. Commitment to one side deprives you of the advantage of \ntime and the luxury of waiting. Let others fall in love with this group or \nthat; for YOUf part don't rush in, don't lose YOUf head. \nFinally, there are occasions when it is wisest to drop all pretence of ap­\npearing supportive and instead to trumpet your independence and self­\nreliance. The aristocratic pose of independence is particularly important \nfor those who need to gain respect. George Washington recognized this in \nhis work to establish the young American republic on firm ground. As \npresident, Washington avoided the temptation of making an alliance with \nFrance or England, despite the pressUfe on hirn to do so. He wanted the \ncountry to eam the world's respect through its independe nce. Although a \ntreaty with France mighthave helped in the short term, in the long run he \nknew it would be more effective to establish the nation's autonomy. Eu­\nrope would have to see the United States as an equal power. \nRemember: You have only so much energy and so much time. Every \nmoment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from YOUf strength . You \nmay be afraid that people will condemn you as heartless, but in the end, \nmaintaining YOUf independence and self-reliance will gain you more re­\nspect and place you in a position of power from which you can choose to \nhelp others on YOUf own initiative. \nREVERSAL Image: A Thicket of Shrubs. \nIn the forest, one shrub \nlatches on to another, \nentangling its neighbor \nwith its thorns, the thicket \nslowly extending its impen­\netrable domain.

The cable came from a reliable source-William \nRalston, owner of the Bank of California-but Harpending nevertheless \ntook it as a practical joke, probably inspired by the recent discovery of \nhuge diamond mines in South Africa. True, when reports had first come in \nof gold being discovered in the western United States, everyone had been \nskeptical, and those had turned out to be true. But a diamond mine in the \nWest! Harpending showed the cable to his fellow financier Baron Roth­\nschild (one of the richest men in the world), saying it must be a joke. The \nbaron, however, replied, \"Don't be too sure ab out that. America is a very \nlarge country. It has furnished the world with many surpri ses already. Per­\nhaps it has others in store.\" Harpending promptly took the first ship back \nto the States. \nWhen Harpending reached San Francisco, there was an excitement in \nthe air recalling the Gold Rush days of the late 1840s. Two crusty prospec­\ntors named Philip Amold and John Slack had been the ones to find the di­\namond rnine. They had not divulged its location, in Wyoming, but had led \na highly respected mining expert to it several weeks back, taking a circular \nroute so he could not guess his whereabouts. Once there, the expert had \nwatched as the miners dug up diamonds. Back in San Francisco the expert \nbad taken the gems to various jewelers, one of whom had estimated their \nworth at $1.5 million. \nHarpending and Ralston now asked Amold and Slack to accompany \nthem back to New York, where the jeweler Charles Tiffany would verify \nthe original estimates. The prospectors responded uneasily-they smelled \na trap: How could they trust these city slickers? What if Tiffany and the fi­\nnanciers managed to steal the whole mine out from under them? Ralston \ntried to allay their fears by giving them $100,000 and placing another \n$300,000 in escrow for them. If the deal went through, they would be paid \nan additional $300,000. The miners agreed. \nThe little group traveled to New York, where a meeting was held at the \nmansion of Samuel L. Barlow. The cream of the city's aristocracy was in at­\ntendance-Gen eral George Brinton McClellan, commander of the Union \nforces in the Civil War; General Benjamin Butler; Horace Greeley, editor \nof the newspaper the New York Tribune; Harpending; Ralston; and Tiffany. \nOnly Slack and Amold were missing-as tourists in the city, they had de­\ncided to go sight-seeing. \nWhen Tiffany announced that the gems were real and worth a fortune, \nthe financiers could barely control their excitement. They wired Roth­\nschild and other tycoons to tell them about the diamond mine and inviting \nthem to share in the investment. At the same time, they also told the \nprospectors that they wanted one more test: They insisted that a mining ex­\npert of their choosing accompany Slack and Amold to the site to verify its \nwealth. The prospectors reluctantly agreed. In the meantime, they said, Now. there is nothing \nof whieh a man is \nprouder than of intel­\nleetual ability, for it is \nthis that gives hirn his \neommanding plaee in \nthe animal warld.

The jewels that Tiffany had examined \nthey left with Harpending for safekeeping. \nSeveral weeks later, a man named Louis Janin, the best mining expert \nin the country, met the prospectors in San Fran cisco. Janin was a born \nskeptic who was determined to make sure that the mine was not a fraud. \nAccompanying Janin were Harpending, and several other inter ested fi­\nnanciers. As with the previous expert, the prospectors led the team through \na complex series of canyons, completely confusing them as to their where­\nabouts . Arriving at the site, the fina nciers watched in amazement as Janin \ndug the area up, leveling anthills, turning over boulders, and finding emer­\nalds, rub ies, sapphires, and most of all dia monds. The dig lasted eight days, \nand by the end, Janin was conv inced: He told the investors that they now \npossessed the richest field in mining history. \"With a hundred men and \nproper mach inery,\" he told them, \"1 would guarantee to send out one mil­\nlion dollars in diamonds every thirty days.\" \nReturning to San Francisco a few days later, Ral ston, Harpending, and \ncompany acted fast to form a $10 million corporation of private investors. \nFirst, however, they had to get rid of Amold and Slack. That meant hiding \ntheir exciteme nt-they certainly did not want to reveal the field's real \nvalue. So they played possum. Who knows if Janin is right, they told the \nprospectors, the mine may not be as rich as we think. This just made the \nprospectors angry. Trying a different tactic, the financiers told the two men \nthat if they insisted on having shares in the mine, they would end up being \nfleeced by the unscrupulous tycoons and investors who would run the cor­\nporatio n; better, they said, to take the $700,000 already offered-an enor­\nmous sum at the time-and put their greed aside. This the prospe ctors \nseemed to understand, and they finally agreed to take the money, in return \nsigning the rights to the site over to the fina nciers, and leaving maps to it. \nNews of the mine spread like wildfi re. Prospectors farm ed out across \nWyoming. Meanwhile Harpending and group began spending the millions \nthey had collected from their investors, buying equipment, hiring the best \nmen in the busine ss, and fumishing luxurious offices in New York and San \nFran cisco. \nA few weeks later, on their first trip back to the site, they learned the \nhard truth : Not a single diamond or ruby was to be found. It was all a fake. \nThey were ruine d. Harpending had unwittingly lured the richest men in \nthe world into the bigge st scam of the century. \nInterpretation \nAmold and Slack pulled off their stupendous con not by using a fake engi­\nneer or bribing Tiffany : All of the experts had been real. All of them hon­\nestly believed in the existence of the mine and in the value of the gems. \nWhat had fooled them all was nothing else than Amold and Slack them­\nselves. The two men seemed to be such rub es, such hayseeds, so naive, that \nno one for an instant had believed them capable of an audacious scam. \nThe prospectors had simply observed the law of appearing more stupid \nthan the mark-the deceiver's First Commandment. \nThe logistics of the con were quite simple. Months before Amold and \nSlack announced the \"discovery\" of the diamond mine, they traveled to \nEurope, where they purchased some real gems for around $12,000 (part of \nthe money they had saved from their days as gold miners) . They then \nsalted the \"mine\" with these gems, which the first expert dug up and \nbrought to San Francisco. The jewelers who had appraised these stones, in­\ncluding Tiffany hirnself , had gotten caught up in the fever and had grossly \noverestimat ed their value. Then Ralston gave the prospectors $100,000 as \nsecurity, and immediately after their trip to New York they simply went to \nAmsterdam, where they bought sacks of uncut gems, before retuming to \nSan Francisco. The second time they salted the mine, there were many \nmore jewels to be found. \nThe effectiv eness of the scherne, however, rested not on tricks like \nthese but on the fact that Amold and Slack played their parts to perfection. \nOn their trip to New York, where they mingled with rnillionaires and ty­\ncoons, they played up their clodhopper image, wearing pants and coats a \nsize or two too small and acting incredulous at everything they saw in the \nbig city. No one believed that these country simpletons could possibly be \nconning the most devious, unscrupulous financiers of the time. And once \nHarpending, Ralston, and even Rothschild accepted the mine's existence, \nanyone who doubted it was questioning the intelligence of the world's most \nsuccessful businessmen. \nIn the end, Harpending' s reputation was ruined and he never recov­\nered; Rothschild leamed bis lesson and never fell for another con; Slack \ntook his money and disappeared from view, never to be found. Amold \nsimply went horne to Kentucky. After all, his sale of his mining rights had \nbeen legitima te; the buyers had taken the best advice, and if the mine had \nrun out of diamonds, that was their problem. Amold used the money to \ngreatly enlarge his farm and open up a bank of his OWll. \nKEY S TO POWER \nThe feeling that someone else is more intelligent than we are is almost in­\ntolerable. We usually try to justify it in different ways: \"He only has book \nknowledge, whereas I have real knowledge .\" \"Her parents paid for her to \nget a good educatio n. If my parents had had as much money, if I had been \nas privileged .... \" \"He's not as smart as he thinks.\" Last but not least: \"She \nmay know her narrow little field better than I do, but beyond that she's re­\nally not smart at all. Even Einstein was a boob outside physics.\" \nGiven how important the idea of intelligence is to most people's van­\nity, it is critical never inadvertently to insult or impugn a person's brain \npower. That is an unforgivable sin. But if you can make this iron rule work \nfor you, it opens up all sorts of avenues of deception. Subliminally reassure \npeople that they are more intelligent than you are, or even that you are a \nbit of amoron, and you can run rings around them. The feeling of intellec­\ntual superiority you give them will disarm their suspicion-mu scles. \nIn 1865 the Prussian councillor Otto von Bismarck wanted Austria to \nLAW 21 159 \n160 LAW 21 sign a certain treaty. The treaty was totally in the interests of Prussia and \nagainst the interests of Austria, and Bismarck would have to strategize to \nget the Austrians to agree to it. But the Austrian negotiator, Count BIome, \nwas an avid cardplayer. His particular game was quinze, and he often said \nthat he could judge a man's character by the way he played quinze . Bis­\nmarck knew of this saying of BIome's. \nThe night before the negotiations were to begin, Bismarck innocently \nengage d BIome in agame of quinze. The Prussian would later write, \"That \nwas the very last time lever played quinze . I played so recklessly that \neveryone was astonished. I lost several thousand talers [the currency of the \ntime], but I succeeded in fooling [BIome], for he believed me to be more \nventure some than lama nd I gave way. \" Besides appearing reckless, Bis­\nmarck also played the witless fool, saying ridiculous things and bumbling \nabout with a surplus of nervous energy. \nAll this made BIome feel he had gathered valuable inf ormation. He \nknew that Bismarck was aggressive--the Prussian already had that reputa­\ntion, and the way he played had confirmed it. And aggressive men, BIome \nknew, can be foolish '.md rash. Accordingly, when the time came to sign \nthe treaty, BIome thought he had the advantage . A heedless fool like Bis­\nmarck, he thought, is incapable of cold-blooded calculation and deception, \nso he only glanced at the treaty before signing it-he failed to read the fine \nprint. As soon as the ink was dry, a joyous Bismarck exelaimed in his face, \n\"WeIl, I could never have believed that I should find an Austrian diplomat \nwilling to sign that document !\" \nThe Chinese have a phrase, \"Masquer ading as a swine to kill the \ntiger.\" This refers to an ancient hunting technique in which the hunter \nelothes himself in the hide and snout of a pig, and mimics its grunting. The \nmighty tiger thinks a pig is coming his way, and lets it get elose, savoring \nthe prospect of an easy meal. But it is the hunter who has the last laugh. \nMasquerading as a swine works wonders on those who, like tigers, are \narrogant and overconfident: The easier they think it is to prey on you, the \nmore easily you can turn the tables. This trick is also useful if you are ambi­\ntious yet find yourself low in the hierarchy: Appearing less intelligent than \nyou are, even a bit of a fool, is the perfect disguise. Look like a harmless pig \nand no one will believe you harbor dangero us ambitions. They may even \npromote you since you seem so likable, and subservient. Claudius before \nhe became emperor of Rome, and the prince of France who later became \nLouis XIII, used this tactic when those above them suspected they might \nhave designs on the throne. By playing the fool as young men, they were \nleft alone. When the time came for them to strike, and to act with vigor and \ndecisiveness, they caught everyone off-guard. \nIntelligence is the obvious quality to downplay, but why stop there? \nTaste and sophistica tion rank elose to intellig ence on the vanity scalej \nmake people feel they are more sophisticated than you are and their guard \nwill come down. As Arnold and Slack knew, an air of complete naivete can \nwork wonders. Those fancy financiers were laughing at them behind their \nbacks, but who laughed loudest in the end? In general, then, always make \npeople believe they are smarter and more sophisticated than you are. They \nwill keep you around because you make them feel beUer about themselves, \nand the longer you are around, the more opportunities you will have to de­\nceive them. \nImage: \nThe Opossum. In playing \ndead, the opossum plays stupid. \nMan y a predator has therefore left i t \nalone. Who could believe that such an \nugly, unintelligent, nervous little creature \ncould be capable of such deception? \nAuthority: Know how to make use of stupidity: The wisest man \nplays this card at times. There are occasions when the highest \nwisdom consists in appearing not to know-you must not be igno­\nrant but capable of playing it. It is not much good being wise \namong fools and sane among lunatics. He who poses as a fool is not \na fooI. The best way to be weIl received by all is to dothe YOUfself \nin the skin of the dumbest of brutes. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) \nREVERSAL \nTo reveal the true nature of yoUf intelligence rarely pays; you should get in \nthe habit of downplaying it at all times. If people inadvertently leam the \ntruth-that you are actually much smarter than you look-they will admire \nyou more for being discreet than for making YOUf brilliance show. At the \nstart of your dimb to the top, of course, you cannot play too stupid: You \nmay want to let YOUf bosses know, in a subtle way, that you are smarter \nthan the competition around you. As you dimb the ladder, however, you \nshould to some degree try to dampen YOUf brilliance. \nThere is, however, one situation where it pays to do the opposite-­\nwhen you can cover up a deception with a show of intelligence. In matters \nof smarts as in most things, appearances are what count. If you seem to \nhave authority and knowledge, people will believe what you say. This can \nbe very useful in getting you out of a scrape. \nThe art dealer Joseph Duveen was once attending a soiree at the New \nYork horne of a tycoon to whom he had recently sold a Dürer painting for \nLAW 21 161 \n162 LAW 21 a high price. Among the guests was a young French art critic who seemed \nextremely knowledgeable and confident. Wanting to impress this man, the \ntycoon' s daughter showed him the Dürer, which had not yet been hung. \nThe critic studied it for a time, then finally said, \"You know, I don't think \nthis Dürer is right.\" He followed the young woman as she hurried to tell \nher father what he had said, and listened as the magnate, deeply unsettled, \ntumed to Duveen for reassura nce. Duveen just laughed. \"How very amus­\ning,\" he said. \"Do you realize, young man, that at least twenty other art ex­\nperts here and in Europe have been taken in too, and have said that \npainting isn't genuine? And now you've made the same mistake.\" His con­\nfident tone and air of authority intimidated the Frenchman, who apolo­\ngized for his mistake. \nDuveen knew that the art market was flooded with fakes, and that . \nmany paintings had been falsely ascribed to old masters. He tried his best \nto distinguish the real from the fake, but in his zeal to seIl he often over­\nplayed a work's authenticity. What mattered to him was that the buyer be­\nlieved he had bought a Dürer, and that Duveen himself convinced \neveryone of his \"expertness\" through his air of irreproachable authority. \nThus, it is important to be able to play the professor when necessary and \nnever impose such an attitude for its own sake. \nLAW \n22 \nUSE THE SURR EN DE R \nTA CT IC: TRANS FO RM \nWEAKNESS INTO PO WER \nJUD GMEN T \nlWlen you are weaker, never fight Jor honor's sake; choose \nsurrender instead.

In classical times, the city of Athens dominated the sea and coastal \nareas around Greece, but Sparta, in the Peloponnese, had been Melos's \noriginal colonizer. During the Peloponnesian War, then, the Melians re­\nfused to ally themselves with Athens and remained loyal to Mother Sparta. \nIn 416 B.C. the Athenians sent an expedition against Melos. Before launch­\ning an all-out attack, however, they dispatched adelegation to persuade the \nMelians to surrender and become an ally rather than suffer devastation and \ndefeat. \n\"You know as weIl as we do,\" the delegates said, \"that the standard of \njustice depends on the equality of power to compel, and that in fact the \nstrong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they \nhave to accept.\" When the Melians responded that this denied the notion \nof fair play, the Athenians said that those in power determined what was \nfair and what was not. The Melians argued that this authority belonged to \nthe gods, not to mortals. \"Our opinion of the gods and our knowledge of \nmen,\" replied a member of the Athenian delegation, \"lead us to conclude \nthat it is a general and necessary law of nature to rule whatever one can.\" \nThe Melians would not budge. Sparta, they insisted, would come to \ntheir defense. The Athenians countered that the Spartans were a conserva­\ntive, practical people, and would not help Melos because they had nothing \nto gain and a lot to lose by doing so. \nFinally the Melians began to talk of honor and the principle of resisting \nbrute force. \"Do not be led astray by a false sense of honor,\" said the Athe­\nnians. \"Honor often brings men to ruin when they are faced with an obvi­\nous danger that somehow affects their pride. There is nothing disgraceful in \ngiving way to the greatest city in Hellas when she is offering you such rea­\nsonable terms.\" The debate ended. The Melians discussed the issue among \nthemselves, and decided to trust in the aid of the Spartans, the will of the \ngods, and the rightness of their cause. They politely declined the Athenians' \noffer. \nA few days later the Athenians invaded Melos. The Melians fought \nnobly, even without the Spartans, who did not come to their rescue. It took \nseveral attempts before the Athenians could surround and besiege their \nmain city, but the Melians finally surrendered. The Athenians wasted no \ntime-they put to death all the men of military age that they could capture, \nthey sold the women and children as slaves, and they repopulated the is­\nland with their own colonists. Only a handful of Melians survived. \nInterpretation \nThe Athenians were one of the most eminently practical people in history, \nand they made the most practical argument they could with the Melians: \nWhen you are weaker, there is nothing to be gained by fighting a useless \nfight. No one comes to help the weak-by doing so they would only put \nthemselves in jeopardy. The weak are alone and must submit. Fighting \ngives you nothing to gain but martyrdom, and in the process a lot of people \nwho do not believe in your cause will die. \nWeakness is no sin, and can even become a strength if you leam how \nto play it right. Had the Melians surrendered in the first place, they would \nhave been able to sabotage the Athenians in subtle ways, or might have \ngotten what they could have out of the alliance and then left it when the \nAthenians themselves were weakened, as in fact happened several years \nlater. Fortunes change and the mighty are often brought down. Surrender \nconceals great power: Lulling the enemy into complacency, it gives you \ntime to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge. Never sacrifice that \ntime in exchange for honor in a battle that you cannot win. \nWeak people never give way when they ought to. \nCardi nal de Re tz, 1613-1 679 \nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW \nSametime in the 1920s the German writer BertoIt Brecht became a convert \nto the cause of Communism. From then on his plays, essays, and poems re­\nflected his revolutionary fervor, and he generally tried to make his ideolog­\nical statements as clear as possible. When Hitler came to power in \nGermany, Brecht and his Communist colleagues became marked men. He \nhad many friends in the United States-Am ericans who sympathized with \nhis beliefs, as well as fellow German intellectuals who had fled Hitler. In \n1941, accordingly, Brecht emigrated to the United States, and chose to set­\ntle in Los Angeles, where he hoped to make a living in the film business. \nOver the next few years Brecht wrote screenplays with a pointedly an­\nticapitalist slant. He had little success in Hollywood, so in 1947, the war \nhaving ended, he decided to return to Europe. That same year, however, \nthe U.S. Congress's House Un-American Activities Committee began its \ninvestigation into supposed Communist infiltration in Hollywood. It began \nto gatber information on Brecht, who had so openly espoused Marxism, \nand on September 19, 1947, only a month before he had planned to leave \nthe United States, he received a subpoena to appear before the committee. \nIn addition to Brecht, a number of other writers, producers, and directors \nwere summoned to appear as well, and this group came to be known as the \nHollywood 19. \nBefore going to Washington, the Hollywood 19 met to decide on a plan \nof action. Their approach would be confrontational. Instead of answering \nquestions about their membership, or lack of it, in the Communist Party, \nthey would read prepared statements that would challenge the authority of \nthe committee and argue that its activities were unconstitutional. Even if \nthis strategy meant imprisonment, it would gain publicity for their cause. \nBrecht disagreed. What good was it, he asked, to play the martyr and \ngain a little public sympathy if in the process they lost the ability to stage \ntheir plays and sell their scripts for years to come? He feIt certain they were Voltaire was living in \nexile in London at a \ntime when anti-French \nsentiment was at \nits highest. One day \nwalking through the \nstreets, he found himself \nsurrounded by an \nangry crowd. \"Hang \nhim. Hang the French­\nman,\" they yelled. \nVoltaire calmly \naddressed the mob with \nthe fol!owing words: \n\"Men of England! You \nwish to kill me because \nI am a Frenchman. Am \nI not punished enough \nin not being born an \nEnglishman?\" The \ncrowd cheered his \nIhoughtful words, and \nescorted him safely \nback 10 his lodgings. \nTHE LITTLE, BROWN \nBOOK OF ANECDOTES, \nCLIFTON FADIMAN, ED., \n1985 \nLAW 22 165 \n166 LAW 22 all more intelligent than the members of the committ ee. Why lower them­\nselves to the level of their opponents by arguing with them? Why not out­\nfox the committee by appearing to surrender to it wbile subtly mocking it? \nThe Hollywood 19 listened to Brecht politely, but decided to stick to their \nplan, leaving Brecht to go bis own way. \nThe committee finally summoned Brecht on October 30. They ex­\npected hirn to do what others among the Hollywood 19 who had testified \nbefore hirn had done: Argue, refuse to answer questions, challenge the \ncommit tee's right to hold its hearing, even yell and hurI insults. Much to \ntheir surprise, however, Brecht was the very picture of congeniality. He \nwore a suit (something he rarely did), smoked a cigar (he had heard that \nthe committee chairman was a passionate cigar smoker) , answered their \nquestions politely, and generally deferred to their authority. \nUnlike the other witnesses, Brecht answered the question of whether \nhe belonged to the Communist Party: He was not a member, he said, \nwhich happened to be the truth. One committee member asked hirn, \"Is it \ntrue you have written a number of revolutionary plays?\" Brecht had writ­\nten many plays with overt Communist messages, but he responded, \"I \nhave written a number of poems and songs and plays in the fight against \nHitler and, of course, they can be considered, therefore, as revolutionary \nbecause I, of course, was for the overthrow of that governmen t.\" This state­\nment went unchallenge d. \nBrecht' s English was more than adequate, but he used an interpreter \nthroughout his testimony, a tactic that allowed hirn to play subtle games \nwith language . When committee members found Communist leanings in \nlines from English editions of his poems, he would repeat the lines in Ger­\nman for the interpreter, who would then retranslate them; and somehow \nthey would c;ome out innocu ous. At one point a committee member read \none of Brecht's revolutionary poems out loud in English, and asked hirn if \nhe had written it. \"No,\" he responded, \"I wrote a German poem, wbich is \nvery different from this.\" The author's elusive answers baffled the commit­\ntee members, but his politeness and the way he yielded to their authority \nmade it impossible for them to get angry with hirn. \nAfter only an hour of questioning, the committee members had had \nenough. \"Thank you very muc h,\" said the chairman, \"You are a good ex­\nample to the [other] witnesses.\" Not only did they free hirn, they off ered to \nhelp hirn if he had any trouble with immigration officials who might detain \nhirn for their own reasons. The following day, Brecht left the United States, \nnever to return. \nInterpretation \nThe Hollywood 19's confrontational approach won them a lot of sympa­\nthy, and years later they gained a kind of vindication in public opinion. But \nthey were also blacklisted, and lost valuable years of profitable working \ntime. Brecht, on the other hand, expressed his disgust at the committee \nmore indirectly. It was not that he changed his beliefs or compromised his \nvalues; instead, during his short testimony, he kept the upper hand by ap-\npearing to yield while all the time running cireles around the committee \nwith vague responses, outright lies that went unchallenged because they \nwere wra pped in enig mas, and word games. In the end he kept the free­\ndom to continue his revolut ionary writing (as opposed to suffering impris­\nonm ent or detainment in the United State s), even while subtly mocking the \ncommittee and its authority with his pseudo-obedience. \nKeep in mind the following: People trying to make a show of their au­\nthority are easily deceived by the surrender tact ic. Your outward sign of \nsubm ission makes them feel important; satisfied that you respect them, \nthey become easier targets for a later counterattack, or for the kind of indi­\nrect ridicule used by Brecht. Measuring your power over time, never sacri­\nfice long-term maneuverability for the short-lived glories of marty rdom. \nWhen the gr eat lord passes, the wise peasant bows deepl y and silentl y Jarts. \nEthiopian proverb \nKEYS TO POWER \nWhat gets us into trouble in the realm of power is often our own overreac­\ntion to the moves of our enemies and riva ls. That overreaction creates \nproblems we would have avo ided had we been more reasona ble. It also \nhas an endless rebound effect, for the enemy then overreacts as well, much \nas the Athenians did to the Melia ns. It is always our first instinct to react, to \nmeet agg ression with some other kind of agg ression. But the next time \nsomeone pushes you and you find yourself starting to react, try this: Do not \nresist or fight back, but yield, turn the other cheek, bend. You will find that \nthis often neutralizes their beha vior-they expected, even wanted you to \nreact with force and so they are caught off-g uard and confo unded by your \nlack of resista nce. By yielding, you in fact control the situation, because \nyour surrender is part of a larger plan to lull them into believing they have \ndefeated you. \nThis is the essence of the surrender tact ic: Inwardly you stay firm, but \noutwardly you bend. Deprived of a reason to get angry, your opponents \nwill often be bewildered instead. And they are unlikely to react with more \nviolence, which would demand areaction from you. Instead you are al­\nlowed the time and space to plot the countermoves that will bring them \ndown. In the battle of the intelligent against the brutal and the agg ressive, \nthe surrender tactic is the supreme weapon. It does require self-cont rol: \nThose who genuinely surrender give up their freedom, and may be \ncrushed by the humiliation of their defeat. You have to remember that you \nonly appear to surrender, like the animal that plays dead to save its hide. \nWe have seen that it can be better to surrender than to fight; faced with \na more powerful opponent and a sure defeat, it is often also better to sur­\nrender than to run away. Running away may save you for the time being, \nbut the aggr essor will eventually catch up with you. If you surrender in­\nstead, you have an opportunity to coil around your enemy and strike with \nyour fangs from elose up. \nLAW 22 167 \n168 LAW 22 In 473 B.C., in ancient China, King Gou jian ofYue suff ered a horrible \ndefeat from the mler of Wu in the battle of Fujiao. Gou jian wanted to flee, \nbut he had an adviser who told hirn to surrender and to place hirnself in the \nservice of the mler of Wu , from which position he could study the man and \nplot his revenge . Deciding to follow this advice, Gou jian gave the mler all \nof his riches, and went to work in his conqueror' s stables as the lowest ser­\nvant. For three years he humbled himself before the mler, who then, finally \nsatisfied of his loyalty, allowed hirn to return horne. Inwardly, however, \nGou jian had spent those three years gathering information and plotting re­\nvenge. When a terrible drought struck Wu , and the kingdom was weak­\nened by inner turmoil, he raised an army, invaded, and won with ease. \nThat is the power behind sur render: It gives you the time and the flexibility \nto plot a devastating counter blow . Had Goujian mn away, he would have \nlost this cha nce. \nWhen foreign trade began to threaten Japanese independence in the \nmid-nineteenth century, the Japanese debated how to defeat the foreign­\ners. One minister, Hotta Masayoshi, wrote a memorandum in 1857 that in­\nfluenced Japa nese policy for years to come: \"I am therefore convinced that \nour policy should be to condude friendly allia nces, to send ships to foreign \ncountries everywhere and conduct trade, to copy the foreigners where they \nare at their best and so repair our own shortcomings, to foster our national \nstrength and complete our arm aments, and so gradually subject the foreign­\ners to our inf luence until in the end all the countries of the world know the \nblessings of perfect tranquillity and our hegemony is acknowledged \nthroughout the globe .\" This is a brilliant application of the Law: Use sur­\nrender to gain access to your enemy. Learn his ways, insinuate yourself \nwith hirn slowly, outwardly conf orm to his customs, but inwardly maintain \nyour own cultu re. Eventually you will emerge victorious, for while he con­\nsiders you weak and inferior, and takes no precautions against you, you are \nusing the time to catch up and surpass him. This soft, permeable form of in­\nvasion is often the best, for the enemy has nothing to react against, prepare \nfor, or resist. And had Japan resisted Western influ ence by force, it might \nwell have suff ered a devastating invasion that would have permanently al­\ntered its culture . \nSurrender can also offer a way of mocking your enemies, of turning \ntheir power against them, as it did for Brecht. Milan Kundera's novel The \nJoke, based on the auth or's experien ces in a penal camp in Czechos lovakia, \ntells the story of how the prison guards organiz ed a relay race, guards \nagainst prisoners. For the guards this was a chance to show off their physi­\ncal superiority. The prisoners knew they were expected to lose, so they \nwent out of their way to oblige-miming exaggerated exertion while \nbarely moving, mnning a few yards and collapsing, limping, jogging ever \nso slowly while the guards raced ahead at full speed. Both by joining the \nrace and by losing it, they had obliged the guards obediently; but their \n\"overobedience\" had mocked the event to the point of mining it. Overobe­\ndience-surrender-was here a way to demon strate superiority in a re­\nverse manner. Resistance would have engaged the prisoners in the cyde of \nviolence, lowering them to the guards' level. Overobeying the guards, how­\never, made them ridiculous, yet they could not rightly punish the prison­\ners, who had only done what they asked. \nPower is always in flux-since the game is by nature fluid, and an arena \nof constant struggle, those with power almost always find themselves even­\ntually on the downward swing. If you find yourself temporarily weakened, \nthe surrender tactic is perfect for raising yourself up again-it disguises your \nambition; it teaches you patience and self-control, key skills in the game; \nand it puts you in the best possible position for taking advantage ofyour op­\npressor's sudden slide. If you run away or fight back, in the long run you \ncannot win. If you surrender, you will almost always emerge victorious. \nImage: An Oak \nTree. The oak \nthat resists the \nwind loses its \nbranches one \nby one, and \nwith nothing \nleft to protect \nit, the trunk fi­\nnally snaps. \nThe oak that \nbends lives long-\ner, its trunk grow-\ning wider, its roots \ndeeper and more tenacious. \nAuthority : Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye \nand a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but \nwhosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to hirn the other \nalso. And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, \nlet them have thy cloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to \ngo a mile, go with hirn twain. (Jesus Christ, in Matthew 5:38-41) \nLAW 22 169 \n170 LAW 22 REVERSAL \nThe point of surrendering is to save your hide for a later date when you \ncan reassert yourself. It is precisely to avoid martyrdom that one surren­\nders, but there are times when the enemy will not relent, and martyr dom \nseems the only way out. Furthermore, if you are willing to die, others may \ngain power and inspiration from your example. \nYet martyrdom, surrender 's reversal, is a messy, inexact tactic, and is \nas violent as the aggression it combats . For every famous martyr there are \nthousands more who have inspired neither areligion nor a rebellion, so \nthat if martyrdom does sometimes grant a certain power, it does so unpre­\ndictably. More important, you will not be around to enjoy that power, such \nas it iso And there is finally something selfish and arrogant about martyrs, \nas if they feit their followers were less important than their own glory. \nWhen power deserts you, it is best to ignore this Law' s reversal . Leave \nmartyrdom alone: The pendulum will swing back your way eventually, \nand you should stay alive to see it. \nLAW \n23 \nCO NC ENTRATE \nYOUR FO RC ES \nJUDGMENT \nConserve your forces and energies by keeping them \nconcentrated at their strongest point.

Wu was \na growing power, but it lacked the great history and civilization of the Mid­\ndIe Kingdom, for centuries the center of Chinese culture. By defeating the \nMiddle Kingdom, the king of Wu would instantly raise his status. \nThe war began with great fanfare and several victories, but it soon \nbogged down. A victory on one front would leave the Wu armies vulnera­\nble on another. The king's chief minister and adviser, Wu Tzu-hsiu, wamed \nhirn that the barbarous state of Yueh, to the south, was beginning to notice \nthe kingdom of Wu's problems and had designs to invade. The king only \nlaughed at such worries-one more big victory and the great Middle King­\ndom would be his. \nIn the year 490, Wu Tzu-hsiu sent his son away to safety in the king­\ndom of Ch'i. In doing so he sent the king a signal that he disapptoved of \nthe war, and that he believed the king's selfish ambition was leading Wu to \nruin. The king, sensing betrayal, lashed out at his minister, accusing hirn of \na lack of loyalty and, in a fit of anger, ordered hirn to kill hirnself. Wu Tzu­\nhsiu obeyed his king, but before he plunged the knife into his chest, he \ncried, \"Tear out my eyes, oh King, and fix them on the gate of Wu, so that I \nmay see the triumphant entry ofYueh.\" \nAs Wu Tzu-hsiu had predicted, within a few years a Yueh army passed \nbeneath the gate of Wu. As the barbarians surrounded the palace, the king \nremembered his minister's last words-and feit the dead man's disembod­\nied eyes watching his disgrace. Unable to bear his shame, the king killed \nhirnself, \"covering his face so that he would not have to meet the reproach­\nful gaze ofhis minister in the next world.\" \nInterpretation \nThe story of Wu is a paradigm of all the empires that have come to ruin by \noverreaching. Drunk with success and siek with ambition, such empires ex­\npand to grotesque proportions and meet a ruin that is total. This is what \nhappened to ancient Athens, which lusted for the faraway island of Sicily \nand ended up losing its empire. The Romans stretched the boundaries of \ntheir empire to encompass vast territories; in doing so they increased their \nvulnerability, and the chances of invasion from yet another barbarian tribe. \nTheir useless expansion led their empire into oblivion. \nFor the Chinese, the fate of the kingdom of Wu serves as an elemental \nlesson on what happens when you dissipate your forces on several fronts, \nlosing sight of distant dangers for the sake of present gain. \"If you are not in \ndanger,\" says Sun-tzu, \"do not fight.\" It is almost a physical law: What is \nbloated beyond its proportions inevitably collapses. The mind must not \nwander from goal to goal, or be distracted by success from its sense of pur­\npose and proportion. What is concentrated, coherent, and connected to its \npast has power. What is dissipated, divided, and distended rots and falls to \nthe ground. The bigger it bloats, the harder it falls. \nOBSER VANCE OF THE LAW \nThe Rothschi ld banking family had hum ble beginnings in the Jewish \nghetto of Frankfurt, Germany. The city's harsh laws made it impossible for \nJews to mingle outside the ghetto, but the Jews had turned this into a \nvirtue-it made them self-reliant, and zealous to preserve their culture at \nall costs. Mayer Amschel, the first of the Rothschilds to accumulate wealth \nby lending money, in the late eighteenth century, weIl understo od the \npower that comes from this kind of concentration and cohesion. \nFirst, Mayer Amschel allied hirnself with one family, the powernd \nprinces of Thurn und Taxis. Instead of spreading his services out, he made \nhimself these princes' primary banker. Second, he entrusted none of his \nbusine ss to outsiders, using only his children and close relative s. The more \nunified and tight-knit the family, the more powerful it would become. Soon \nMayer Amsche l's five sons were running the business. And when Mayer \nAmschel lay dying, in 1812, he refused to name a principal heir, instead set­\nting up all of his sons to continue ·the family tradition, so that they would \nstay united and would resist the dangers of diffusion and of infiltration by \noutsiders. \nOnce Mayer Amsc hel's sons controlled the family business, they de­\ncided that the key to wealth on a larger scale was to secure a foothold in the \nfinanc es of Europe as a whole , rather than being tied to any one country or \nprinee. Of the five brothers, Nathan had already opened up shop in Lon­\ndon. In 1813 James moved to Paris. Amsche l remained in Frankfurt, \nSalomon established hirnself in Vienna, and Karl, the youngest son, went \nto Naples. With each sphere of influence covered, they could tighten their \nhold on Euro pe's financial markets. \nThis widespread network, of course, opened the Rothschilds to the \nvery danger of which their father had warned them: diffusion, division, dis­\nsension. They avoided this danger, and established themselves as the most \npowerful force in European finance and politics, by once again resorting to \nthe strategy of the ghetto--excluding outsiders, concentrating their forces. \nThe Rothschilds established the fastest courier system in Europe, allowing \nthem to get news of events before all their competito rs. They held a virtual \nmonopoly on informati on. And their internal communicat ions and corre­\nspondence were written in Frankfurt Yiddish, and in a code that only the \nbrothers could decipher. There was no point in stealing this information­\nno one could understand it. \"Even the shewdest bankers cannot find their \nway through the Rothschild maze,\" admitte d a financier who had tried to \ninfiltrate the clan. \nIn 1824 James Rothschild decided it was time to get marri ed. This pre­\nsented a problem for the Rothschi lds, since it meant incorporating an out­\nsider into the Rothschild clan, an outsider who could betray its secrets. \nJames therefore decided to marry within the fami ly, and chose the daugh­\nter of his brother Salomon. The brothers were ecstatic-this was the per­\nfeet solution to their marriage problems. James's choice now became the \nfamily policy: Two years later, Nathan married off his daughter to hissing at everyone \nwho passes by, you \nbring upon yourself the \nderision of all behold· \ners. I confess that I am \nonly formed to move \nupon the ground; but \nhow graceful is my \nmakel How weil turned \nmy limbs! How highly \nfinished my whole \nbody! How great my \nstrength! How aston­\nishing my speed! I had \nmuch rather be \nconfined to one \nelement, and be \nadmired in that, than \nbe a goose in all! \" \nFABLES FROM \nBOCCACCIO AND \nCHAUCER, \nDR. JOHN AIKIN, \n1747- 1822 \nBeware of dissipating \nyour powers; strive \nconstantly to concen­\ntrate them. Genius \nthinks it can do what­\never it sees others \ndOing, but it is sure to \nrepent of every ill­\njudged outlay. \nJOHANN VON GOETHE, \n1749-1832 \nLAW 23 173 \n174 LAW 23 Salomon's son. In the years to come, the five brothers arranged eighteen \nmatch es among their cbildren, sixteen of these being contracted between \nfirst cousins. \n\"We are like the mechanism of a watch : Each part is essent ial,\" said \nbrother Salomon . As in a watch, every part of the business moved in con­\ncert with every other, and the inner workings were invisible to the world, \nwhich only saw the movement of the hands . While other rich and powerful \nfamilies suff ered irrecoverable downturns during the tumultous first half of \nthe nineteenth century, the tight-knit Rothschilds managed not only to pre­\nserve but to expand their unpr ecedented wealth. \nInterpretati on \nThe Roth schilds were born in strange times. They came from a place that \nhad not changed in centu ries, but lived in an age that gave birth to the In­\ndustrial Revolution, the French Revolution, and an endless series of up­\nheavals. The Rothchilds kept the past aliv e, resisted the patterns of \ndispersion of their era and for this are emblematic of the law of conc entra­\ntion. \nNo one represents this better than James Roth schild, the son who es­\ntablished himself in Pari s. In bis lifetime J ames witnessed the defeat of \nNapoleon, the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, the bourgeois monar­\nchy of Orleans, the return to a republic, and finally the enthronement of \nNapoleo \\ IH. French styles and fashions changed at a relent less pace dur­\ning all trus turmoil. Without appearing to be a relic of the past, J ames \nsteered his family as if the ghetto lived on within them. He kept alive his \nclan's inner cohesion and strength. Only through such an anchoring in the \npast was the fam ily able to thrive amidst such chao s. Concentration was the \nfoundation of the Rothschilds' power, wealth, and stability. \nThe best strate gy is always to be very strong; first in general, then \nat the decis ive point .... There is no higher and simpler law of strate gy \nthan that of keeping one's forces concentrated .... In short the \nfirst principle is: act with the utmost concentrati on. \nOn War, Carl von Clausewitz, 1780-18 31 \nKEYS TO PO WER \nThe world is plagued by greater and greater divisi on-within countries, \npolitical group s, fam ilies, even individual s. We are all in astate of total dis­\ntraction and diffusion, hardly able to keep our minds in one direction be­\nfore we are pulled in a thousand others. The modem world' s level of \nconflict is higher than ever, and we have internalized it in our own li ves. \nThe solution is a form of retreat inside ourselves, to the past, to more \nconcentrated forms of thought and actio n. As Schopenhauer wrote, \"Intel­\nlect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of extensi ty.\" Napoleon \nknew the value of concentrating your forces at the enem y's weakest spot -\nit was the secret of his success on the battlefield. But his willpower and his \nmind were equally modeled on this notion. Single-mindedness of purpose, \ntotal concentration on the goal, and the use of these qualities against peo­\npIe less focused, people in astate of distraction-such an arrow will find its \nmark every time and overwhelm the enemy. \nCasanova attributed his success in life to his ability to concentrate on a \nsingle goal and push at it until it yielded. It was his ability to give hirnself \nover completely to the women he desired that made hirn so intensely se­\nductive. For the weeks or months that one of these women lived in his \norbit, he thought of no one else. When he was imprisoned in the treacher­\nous \"leads\" of the doge's palace in Venice, a prison from which no one had \never escaped, he concentrated his mind on the single goal of escape, day \nafter day. A change of cells, which meant that months of digging had all \nbeen for naught, did not discourage hirn; he persisted and eventually es­\ncaped. \"I have always believed,\" he later wrote, \"that when a man gets it \ninto his head to do something, and when he exclusively occupies hirnself in \nthat design, he must succeed, whatever the difficulties. That man will be­\ncome Grand Vizier or Pope.\" \nConcentrate (,la single goal, a single task, and beat it into submission. \nIn the world of power you will constantIy need help from other people, \nusually those more powerful than you. The fool flits from one person to an­\nother, believing that he will survive by spreading hirnself out. It is a corol­\nlary of the law of concentration, however, that much energy is saved, and \nmore power is attained, by affixing yourself to a single, appropriate source \nof power. The scientist Nikola Tesla ruined hirnself by believing that he \nsomehow maintained his independence by not having to serve a single \nmaster. He even turned down J. P. Morgan, who offered hirn a rich con­\ntract. In the end, Tesla's \"independence\" meant that he could depend on \nno single patron, but was always having to toady up to a dozen of them. \nLater in his life he realized his mistake. \nAll the great Renaissance painters and writers wrestIed with this prob­\nlem, none more so than the sixteenth-century writer Pietro Aretino. \nThroughout his life Aretino suffered the indignities of having to pIe ase this \nprince and that. At last, he had had enough, and decided to woo Charles \nV, promising the emperor the services of his powerful pen. He finally dis­\ncovered the freedom that came from attachment to a single source of \npower. Michelangelo found this freedom with Pope Julius H, Galileo with \nthe Medicis. In the end, the single patron appreciates your loyalty and be­\ncomes dependent on your serv ices; in the long run the master serves the \nslave. \nFinally, power itself always exists in concentrated forms. In any orga­\nnization it is inevitable for a small group to hold the strings. And often it is \nnot those with the titIes. In the game of power, only the fool flails about \nwithout fixing his target. You must find out who controls the operations, \nwho is the real director behind the scenes. As Richelieu discovered at the \nbeginning of his rise to the top of the French political scene during the \nLAW 23 175 \n176 LAW 23 early seventeenth century, it was not King Louis XIII who decided things, \nit was the king's mother. And so he attached hirnself to her, and catapulted \nthrough the ranks of the courtiers, all the way to the top. \nIt is enough to strike oil once-your wealth and power are assured for \na lifetime. \nImage: The Arrow. You cannot hit two targets \nwith one arrow. If your thoughts stray, you \nmiss the enemy's heart. Mind and \narrow must become one. Only \nwith such concentration of \nmental and physica l \npower can your arrow \nhit the target and \npierce the \nheart. \nAuthority: Prize intensity more than extensity. Perfection re­\nsides in quality, not quantity. Extent alone never rises above \nmediocrity, and it is the misfortune of men with wide general \ninterests that while they would like to have their finger in every \npie, they have one in none. Intensity gives eminen ce, and rises \nto the heroic in matters sublime. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) \nREVERSAL \nThere are dangers in concentration, and moments when dispersion is the \nproper tactical move. Fighting the Nationalists for control of China, Mao \nTse-tung and the Communists fought a protracted war on several fronts, \nusing sabotage and ambush as their main weapons. Dispersal is often suit­\nable for the weaker side; it is, in fact, a crucial principle of guerrilla warfare. \nWhen fighting a stronger army, concentrating YOUf forces only makes you \nan easier target-better to dissolve into the scenery and frustrate your \nenemy with the elusiveness of YOUf presence. \nTying YOUfself to a single SOUfce of power has one preeminent danger: \nIf that person dies, leaves, or falls from grace, you suff er. This is what hap­\npened to Cesare Borgia, who derived his power from his father, Pope \nAlexander VI. It was the pope who gave Cesare armies to fight with and \nwars to wage in his name. When he suddenly died (perhaps from poison) , \nCesare was as good as dead. He had made far too many enemies over the \nyears, and was now without his father's protection. In cases when you may \nneed protection, then, it is often wise to entwine YOUfseif around several \nsources of power. Such a move would be especially prudent in periods of \ngreat tumult and violent change, or when YOUf enemies are numerous. The \nmore patrons and masters you serve the less risk you run if one of them \nfalls from power. Such dispersion will even allow you to play one off \nagainst the other. Even if you concentrate on the single SOUfce of power, \nyou still must practice caution, and I cepare for the day when YOUf master \nor patron is no longer there to help you. \nFinally, being too single-minded in purpose can make you an intolera­\nble bore, especially in the arts. The Renaissance painter Paolo Uccello was \nso obsessed with perspective that his paintings look lifeless and contrived. \nWhereas Leonardo da Vinci interested himself in everything -architec­\nture, painting, warfare, sculpture , mechanics. Diffusion was the source of \nhis power. But such genius is rare, and the rest of us are better off erring on \nthe side of intensity. \nLAW 23 177 \n178 LAW \n24 \nPLAY THE PERFECT \nCO URTIER \nJUDGMENT \nThe perfect courtier thrives in a world where everything \nrevolves around power and political dexterity. He has \nmastered the art of indirection; he flatters, yields to supe­\nriors, and asserts power over others in the most oblique \nand gracejul manner. Learn and apply the laws of \ncourtiership and there will be no limit to how far you can \nrise in the court. \nCOUR T SOCIE TY \nIt is a fact of human nature t�.J.t the structure of a court society forms itself \naround power. In the past;' llie court gathered around the roler, and had \nmany functions: Besides keeping the roler amused, it was a way to solidify \nthe hierarchy of royalty, nobility, and the upper classes, and to keep the \nnobility both sub ordinate and elose to the ruler, so that he could keep an \neye on them. The court serves power in many ways, but most of all it glori­\nfies the roler, providing him with a microcosmic world that must struggle \nto pIe ase him. \nTo be a courtier was a dangerous game. A nineteenth-century Arab \ntraveler to the court of Darfur, in what is now Sudan, reported that \ncourtiers there had to do whatever the sultan did: If he were injured, they \nhad to suffer the same injury; if he fell off his horse during a hunt, they fell, \ntoo. Mimicry like this appeared in courts all over the world. More trouble­\nsame was the danger of displeasing the roler-one wrong move spelled \ndeath or exile. The successful courtier had to walk a tightrope, pleasing but \nnot pleasing too much, obeying but somehow distinguishing himself from \nthe other courtiers, while also never distinguishing himself so far as to \nmake the roler insecure . \nGreat courtiers throughout history have mastered the science of ma­\nnipulating people. They make the king feel more kingly; they make every­\none else fear their power. They are magicians of appearance, knowing that \nmost things at court are judged by how they seem. Great courtiers are gra­\ncious and polite; their aggression is veiled and indirect. Masters of the \nword, they never say more than necessa ry, getting the most out of a com­\npliment or hidden insult. They are magnets of pleasure- people want to be \naround them because they know how to please, yet they neither fawn nor \nhumiliate themsel ves. Great courtiers become the king's favorites, enjoying \nthe benefits of that position. They often end up more powernd than the \nruler, for they are wizards in the accumulation of influence. \nMany today dismiss court life as a relic of the past, a historical curios­\nity. They reason, according to Machiavelli, \"as though heaven, the sun, the \nelements, and men had change d the order of their motions and power, and \nwere different from what they were in ancient times.\" There may be no \nmore Sun Kings but there are still plenty of people who believe the sun re­\nvolves around them. The royal court may have more or less disappeared, \nor at least lost its power, but courts and courtiers still exist because power \nstill exists. A courtier is rarely asked to fall off a horse anymore, but the \nlaws that govem court politics are as timeless as the laws of power. There is \nmuch to be leamed, then, from great courtiers past and present. \nTHE LAWS OF COUR T POLITICS \nAvoid Ostentation.

Hence politeness \nis 10 human natllre \nwhat warmth is to wax. \nARTHUR \nSCHOP ENHAUER, \n1788�1860 \n180 LAW 24 the more suspicion you cau se. You also stir up enough envy among your \npeers to induce treachery and backstabbing. Be careful, ever so careful, in \ntrump eting your own achievements, and always talk less ab out yourself \nthan about other people. Modesty is generally pref erable. \nPractice Nonchalan ce. Never seem to be working too hard. Your talent \nmust appear to flow naturally, with an ease that makes people take you for \na genius rath er than a workaholic. Even when something demands a lot of \nsweat, make it look effortless- people prefer to not see your blood and toil, \nwhich is another form of ostentat ion. It is better for them to marvel at how \ngrac efully you have achie ved your accomplishment than to wonder why it \ntook so much work. \nBe Frugal with Flatte ry. It may seem that your superiors cannot get \nenough flattery, but too much of even a good thing loses its valu e. It also \nstirs up suspicion among your peers. Leam to flatter indirect ly-by down­\nplaying your own contribution, for exam ple, to make your master look bet­\nter. \nArrange to Be Noticed. There is a parad ox: You cannot display yourself \ntoo brazenly, yet you must also get yourself noticed. In the court of Louis \nXIV, whoever the king decided to look at rose instantly in the court hierar­\nchy. You stand no chance of rising if the ruler does not notice you in the \nswamp of court iers. This task requires much art. It is often initially a matter \nof being seen, in the literal sense. Pay atte ntion to your physical appear­\nance, then, and find a way to create a distinctive-a subtly distinctive -style \nand image. \nAlter Your Style and Language According to the Person You Are \nDealing With . The pseudo-belief in equal ity-th e idea that talking and \nacting the same way with everyone, no matter what their rank, makes you \nsomehow a paragon of civiliza tion-is a terrible mista ke. Those below you \nwill take it as a form of condescension, which it is, and those above you will \nbe offen ded, although they may not admit it. You must change your style \nand your way of speak ing to suit each person. This is not lying, it is acting; \nand acting is an art, not a gift from God. Leam the art. This is also true for \nthe great variety of cultures found in the modem court: Never assume that \nyour criteria of behavior and judgment are univer sal. Not only is an inabil­\nity to adapt to anoth er culture the height of barbarism, it puts you at a dis­\nadvanta ge. \nNever Be the Bearer of Bad News. The king kills the messenger who \nbrings bad news: This is a diche but there is truth to it. You must struggle \nand if necessary lie and cheat to be sure that the lot of the bearer of bad \nnews falls on a colleague, never on you. Bring only good news and your \napproach will gladden your master. \nNever Aff ect Friendliness and Intirnacy with Your Master . He does \nnot want a friend for a subordinate, he wants a sub ordinate. Never ap­\nproach hirn in an easy, friendly way, or act as if you are on the best of \nterrns-that is his prerogative. If he chooses to deal with you on this level, \nassume a wary chumminess. Otherwise err in the opposite direction, and \nmake the distance between you clear. \nNever Criticize Those Above You Dire ctly. This may seem obvious, \nbut there are often times when some sort of criticism is necessary-to say \nnothing, or to give no advice, would open you to risks of another sort. You \nmust leam, however, to couch YOUf advice and criticism as indirectly and as \npolitely as possible. Think twice, or three times, before deciding you have \nmade them sufficiently circuitous. Err on the side of subtlety and gentleness. \nBe Frugal in Asking Those Above You for Favors. Nothing irritates a \nmaster more than having to reject someone's request. It stirs up guilt and \nresentment. Ask for favors as rarely as possible, and know when to stop. \nRather than making YOUfself the supplicant, it is always better to eam YOUf \nfavors, so that the ruler bestows them willingly. Most important: Do not ask \nfor favors on another person's behalf, least of all a friend's. \nNever Joke About Appearances or Taste. A lively wit and a humorous \ndisposition are essential qualities for a good courtier, and there are times \nwhen vulgarity is appropriate and engaging. But avoid any kind of joke \nabout appearance or taste, two highly sensitive areas, especially with those \nabove you. Do not even try it when you are away from them. You will dig \nYOUf OWD grave. \nDo Not Be the Court Cynic. Express admiration for the good work of \nothers. If you constantly criticize YOUf equals or subordinates some of that \ncriticism will rub off on you, hovering over you like a gray cloud wherever \nyou go. People will groan at each new cynical comment, and you will irri­\ntate them. By expressing modest admiration for other people's achieve­\nments, you paradoxically call attention to your OWD. The ability to express \nwonder and amazement, and seem like you mean it, is a rare and dying tal­\nent, but one still greatly valued. \nBe Self -obs ervant. The mirror is a miraculous invention; without it you \nwould commit great sins against beauty and decorum. You also need a mir­\nror for your actions. This can sometimes come from other people telling \nyou what they see in you, but that is not the most trustworthy method: You \nmust be the mirror, training your mind to try to see YOUfself as others see \nyou. Are you acting too obsequious? Are you trying too hard to please? Do \nyou seem desperate for attention, giving the impression that you are on the \ndecline? Be observant about YOUfself and you will avoid a mountain of \nblunders. \nLAW 24 181 \n182 LAW 24 Master Your Emotions. As an actor in a great play, you must leam to cry \nand laugh on command and when it is appropria te. You must be able both \nto disguise your anger and frustration and to fake your contentment and \nagreement. You must be the master of your own face. Call it lying if you \nlike; but if you prefer to not play the game and to always be honest and up­\nfront, do not complain when others call you obnoxious and arrogant. \nFit the Spirit of the Times. A slight affeetation of a past era can be \ncharming, as long as you choose aperiod at least twenty years back; wear­\ning the fashions of ten years ago is ludicrous, unless you enjoy the role of \ncourt jester. Your spirit and way of thinking must keep up with the times, \neven if the times offend your sensibilit ies. Be too forward-thinking, how­\never, and no one will understand you. It is never a good idea to stand out \ntoo much in this area; you are best off at least being able to mimic the spirit \nof the times. \nBe a Source of Pleasure. This is critical. It is an obvious law of human \nnature that we will flee what is unpleasant and distasteful, while charm and \nthe promise of delight will draw us like moths to a flame. Make yourself the \nflame and you will rise to the top. Since life is otherwise so full of unpleas­\nantness and pleasure so scarce, you will be as indispensable as food and \ndrink. This may seem obvious, but what is obvious is often ignored or un­\nappreciated. There are degrees to this: Not everyone can play the role of \nfavorite, for not everyone is blessed with charm and wit. But we can all \ncontrol our unpleasant qualities and obscure them when necessa ry. \nA man who knows the court is master of his gestures, of his eyes and \nof his face; he is profound, impenet rable; he dissimu lates bad offices, \nsmiles at his enemies, controls his irritation, disgu ises his passions, \nbelies his heart, speaks and acts against his feelings. \nJean de La Bruyer e, 1645-1 696 \nSCENES OF COUR T LIFE: Exemplary Deeds and Fatal Mistakes \nScene I \nAlexander the Great, conqueror of the Mediterranean basin and the Mid­\ndIe East through to India, had had the great Aristotle as his tutor and men­\ntor, and throughout his short life he remain ed devoted to philosophy and \nhis master's teachings . He once complained to Aristotle that during his \nlong campaigns he had no one with whom he could discuss philosophical \nmatters. Aristotle responded by suggesting that he take Callisthenes, a for­\nmer pupil of Aristotl e's and a promising philosopher in his own right, \nalong on the next campaign. \nAristotle had schooled Callisth enes in the skills ofbeing a courtier, but \nthe young man secretly scoffed at them. He believed in pure philosophy, in \nunadorn ed words, in speaking the naked truth. If Alexander loved learning \nso much, Callisthenes thought, he could not object to one who spoke his \nmind. During one of Alexander's ma jor campaig ns, Call isthenes spoke his \nmind one too many times and Alexander had him put to death. \nInterpretati on \nIn court, honesty is a fool's game. Never be so self-absorbed as to believe \nthat the master is interested in your criticisms of hirn, no matter how accu­\nrate they are. \nScene II \nBeginning in the Han Dynasty two thousand years ago, Chinese scholars \ncompiled aseries ofwritings called the 27 Histories, an official biography of \neach dynasty, including stor ies, stati stics, census figure s, and war chroni­\ndes. Each history also contained a chapter called \"Unusual Eve nts,\" and \nhere, among the listings of earth quakes and floods, there would sometimes \nsudde nly appear descriptions of such bizarre manif estations as two-headed \nsheep, geese flying backward, stars suddenly appearing in different parts of \nthe sky, and so on. The earthquakes could be historically verifie d, but the \nmonsters and weird natural phenomena were clearly inserted on purpose, \nand invari ably occurred in clusters. What could this mean? \nThe Chi nese emperor was considered more than a man-he was a \nforce of nature. His kingdom was the center of the univ erse, and every­\nthing revo lved around hirn. He embodied the world's perf ection. To criti­\ncize hirn or any of his actions would have been to criticize the divine order. \nNo minister or courtier dared approach the emperor with even the slighte st \ncauti onary word. But emperors were fallible and the kingdom suffered \ngreatly by their mistak es. Inserting sightings of strange phenomena into the \ncourt chroni cles was the only way to warn them. The emperor would read \nof geese flying backward and moons out of orbit, and realize that he was \nbeing caut ioned. His actions were unbalancing the universe and needed to \nchange . \nInterp retat ion \nFor Chi nese courtiers, the problem of how to give the emperor advice was \nan important issue. Over the years, thousands of them had died trying to \nwarn or counsel their master. To be made safely, their criti cisms had to be \nindirect-yet if they were too indirect they would not be heeded. The \nchro nicles were their solut ion: Identify no one person as the source of criti­\ncism, make the advi ce as impersonal as possible, but let the emperor know \nthe gravity of the situa tion. \nYour master is no longer the center of the univ erse, but he still imag­\nines that everything revolves around hirn. When you criticize hirn he sees \nthe person criticizing, not the criticism itself. Like the Chinese courtiers, \nyou must find a way to disappear behind the warning. Use symbols and \nother indirect methods to paint a picture of the problems to come, without \nputting your neck on the line. \nLAW 24 183 \n184 LAW 24 Scene III \nEarly in his career, the French architect Jules Mansart received commis­\nsions to design minor additions to Versailles for King Louis XIV. For each \ndesign he would draw up his plans, making sure they followed Louis's in­\nstructions closely. He would then present them to His Majesty. \nThe courtier Saint-Simon described Mansart's technique in dealing \nwith the king: \"His particular skill was to show the king plans that pur­\nposely included something imperfect about them, often dealing with the \ngardens, which were not Mansart's specialty. The king, as Mansart ex­\npected, would put his finger exactly on the problem and propose how to \nsolve it, at which point Mansart would exclaim for all to hear that he would \nnever have seen the problem that the king had so masterfully found and \nsolved; he would burst with admiration, confessing that next to the king he \nwas but a lowly pupil.\" At the age of thirty, having used these methods \ntime and time again, Mansart received a prestigious royal commission : Al­\nthough he was less talented and experienced than a number of other \nFrench designers, he was to take charge of the enlargement of Versailles. \nHe was the king's architect from then on. \nInterpretation \nAs a young man, Mansart had seen how many royal craftsmen in the ser­\nvice of Louis XIV had lost their positions not through a lack of talent but \nthrough a costly social blunder. He would not make that mistake. Mansart \nalways strove to make Louis feel better about hirnself, to feed the king's \nvanity as publicly as possible. \nNever imagine that skill and talent are all that matter. In court the \ncourtier's art is more important than his talent; never spend so much time \non your studies that you neglect your social skills. And the greatest skill of \nall is the ability to make the master look more talented than those around \nhirn. \nScene IV \nJean-Baptiste Isabey had become the unofficial painter of the Napole onic \ncourt. During the Congress of Vienna in 1814, after Napoleon, defeated, \nhad been imprisoned on the island of Elba, the participants in these meet­\nings, which were to decide the fate of Europe, invited Isabey to immortal­\nize the historie events in an epic painting. \nWhen Isabey arrived in Vienna, Talleyrand, the main negotiator for \nthe French, paid the artist a visit. Considering his role in the procee dings, \nthe statesman explained, he expected to occupy center stage in the paint­\ning. Isabey cordially agreed. A few days later the Duke of Wellington, the \nmain negotiator for the English, also approached Isabey, and said much \nthe same thing that Talleyrand had. The ever polite Isabey agreed that the \ngreat duke should indeed be the center of attention. \nBack in his studio, Isabey pondered the dilemma. If he gave the spot­\nlight to either of the two men, he could create a diplomatie rift, stirring up \nall sorts of resentrnent at a time when peace and concord were critical. \nWhen the painting was finally unve iled, however, both Talleyrand and \nWel lington feIt honored and satisfied. The work depicts a large hall filled \nwith diplomats and politicians from all over Euro pe. On one side the Duke \nof Wellington enters the room, and all eyes are turned toward him; he is \nthe \"center\" of atten tion. In the very center of the painting, meanwhil e, sits \nTalleyran d. \nInter pretation \nIt is often very difficult to satisfy the master, but to satisfy two masters in \none stroke takes the genius of a great courtier. Such predicaments are com­\nmon in the life of a court ier: By giving attention to one master, he dis­\npleases another. You must find a way to navigate this Scylla and Charybdis \nsafely. Masters must receive their due; never inadvertently stir up the re­\nsentment of one in pleasing another. \nScene V \nGeorge Brummell, also known as Beau Brummell, made his mark in the \nlate 1700s by the supreme elegance of his appearanc e, his popularization of \nshoe buckles (soon imitated by all the dandies), and his clever way with \nwords . His London house was the fashionable spot in town, and Brummell \nwas the authority on all matters of fash ion. If he disliked your footwear, \nyou immediately got rid of it and bought whatever he was wearing. He per­\nfeeted the art of tying a cravat; Lord Byron was said to spend many a night \nin front of the mirror trying to figure out the secret behind Brumm ell's per­\nfeet kno ts. \nOne of Brumme ll's greatest admirers was the Prince of Wal es, who \nfancied himself a fashionable young man. Becoming attach ed to the \nprince 's court (and provided with a royal pension), Brummell was soon so \nsure of his own authority there that he took to joking about the prince's \nweight, referring to his host as Big Ben. Since trimne ss of figure was an im­\nportant quality for a dandy, this was a withering criti cism. At dinner once, \nwhen the service was slow, Brummell said to the prince, \"Do ring, Big \nBen. \" The prince rang, but when the valet arrived he ordered the man to \nshow Brum mell the door and never admit him aga in. \nDespite falling into the prince's disfavor, Brummell continued to treat \neveryone around him with the same arrogance. Without the Prince of \nWales' patronage to support him, he sank into horrible debt, but he main­\ntained his insolent manners, and everyone so on abandoned him. He died \nin the most pitia ble poverty, alone and deranged. \nInterpretat ion \nBeau Brum mell's devastating wit was one of the qualities that endeared \nhim to the Prince ofW ales. But not even he, the arbiter oftaste and fashion, \ncould get away with a joke about the prince's app earance, least of all to his \nface. Never joke about a person's plumpness, even indire ctly-and particu­\nlady when he is your master. The poorhouses of history are filled with peo­\npIe who have made such jokes at their master's expense. \nLAW 24 185 \n186 LAW 24 Scene VI \nPope Urban VIIIwanted to be remembered for his skiUs in writing poetry, \nwhich unfortunately were mediocre at best. In 1629 Duke Francesco \nd'Este, knowing the pope's literary pretensions, sent the poet Fulvio Testi \nas his ambassador to the Vatican. One of Testi's letters to the duke reveals \nwhy he was chosen: \"Once our discussion was over, I kneeled to depart, \nbut His Holiness made a signal and walked to another room where he \nsleeps, and after reaching a small table, he grabbed a bundle of papers and \nthus, tuming to me with a smiling face, he said: 'We want Your Lordship to \nlisten to some of our compositions .' And, in fact, he read me two very long \nPindaric poems, one in praise of the most holy Virgin, and the other one \nab out Countess Matilde.\" \nWe do not know exactly what Testi thought of these very long poems, \nsince it would have been dangerous for hirn to state his opinion freely, \neven in a letter. But he went on to write, \"I, following the mood, com­\nmented on each line with the needed praise, and, after having kissed His \nHoliness's foot for such an unusual sign of benevolence [the reading of the \npoetry], I left.\" Weeks later, when the duke hirnself visited the pope, he \nmanaged to recite entire verses of the pope's poetry and praised it enough \nto make the pope \"so jubilant he seemed to lose his mind.\" \nInterpretation \nIn matters of taste you can never be too obsequious with your master. Ta ste \nis one of the ego's prickliest parts; never impugn or question the master's \ntaste-his poetry is sublime, his dress impeccable, and his manner the \nmodel for all. \nScene VII \nOne aftemoon in ancient China, Chao, ruler of Han from 358 to 333 B.C., \ngot drunk and fell asleep in the palace gardens. The court crown-keeper, \nwhose sole task was to look after the ruler's head apparel, passed through \nthe gardens and saw his master sleeping without a coat. Since it was getting \ncold, the crown-keeper placed his own coat over the ruler, and left. \nWhen Chao awoke and saw the coat upon hirn, he asked his atten­\ndants, \"Who put more clothes on my body?\" \"The crow n-keeper,\" they \nreplied. The ruler immediately called for his official coat-keeper and had \nhirn punished for neglecting his duties. He also called for the crown­\nkeeper, whom he had beheaded. \nInterpretation \nDo not overstep your bounds. Do what you are assigned to do, to the best \nof your abilities, and never do more. To think that by doing more you are \ndoing better is a common blunder. It is never good to seem to be trying too \nhard-it is as if you were covering up some deficiency. Fulfilling a task that \nhas not been asked of you just makes people suspicious. If you are a crown­\nkeeper, be a crown-keeper. Save your excess energy for when you are not \nin the court. \nScene VIII \nOne day, for amusement, the Italian Renaissance painter Fra Filippo Lippi \n(1406-1469) and some friends went sailing in a small boat off Ancona. \nThere they were captured by two Moorish galleys, which hauled them off \nin chains to Barbary, where they were sold as slaves. For eighteen long \nmonths Filippo toiled with no hope of returning to ltaly. \nOn several occasions Filippo saw the man who had bought hirn pass \nby, and one day he decided to sketch this man's portrait, using burnt \ncoal-charcoal-from the fire. Still in his chains, he found a white wall, \nwhere he drew a full-Iength likeness of his owner in Moorish clothing. The \nowner so on heard about this, for no one had seen such skill in drawing be­\nfore in these parts; it seemed like a miracle, a gift from God. The drawing \nso pleased the owner that he instantly gave Filippo his freedom and em­\nployed hirn in his court. All the big men on the Barbary coast came to see \nthe magnificent color portraits that Fra Filippo then proceeded to do, and \nfinally, in gratitude for the honor in this way brought upon hirn, Filippo's \nowner returned the artist safely to ltaly. \nInterpretation \nWe who toil for other people have all in some way been captured by pi­\nrates and sold into slavery. But like Fra Filippo (if to a lesser degree), most \nof us possess some gift, same talent, an ability to do something better than \nother people. Make your master a gift of YOUf talents and you will rise \nabove other courtiers. Let hirn take the credit if necessary, it will only be \ntemporary: Use hirn as a stepping stone, a way of displaying your talent \nand eventually buying your freedom from enslavement. \nScene IX \nAlfonso 1 of Aragon once had a servant who told the king that the night \nbefore he had had a dream: Alfonso had given hirn a gift of weapons, \nhorses, and clothes. Alfonso, a generous, lordly man, decided it would be \namusing to make this dream come true, and promptly gave the servant \nexaetly these gifts. \nA little while later, the same servant announced to Alfonso that he had \nhad yet another dream, and in this one Alfonso had given hirn a consider­\nable pile of gold florins. The king smiled and said, \"Don't believe in \ndreams from now on; they He.\" \nInterpretation \nIn his treatment of the servant's first dream, Alfonso remained in control. \nBy making a dream come true, he claimed a godlike power for hirnself, if \nin a mild and humorous way. In the second dream, however, all appear­\nanee of magic was gone; this was no thing but an ugly con game on the ser­\nvant's part. Never ask for too much, then, and know when to stop. It is the \nmaster's prerogative to give-to give when he wants and what he wants, \nand to do so without prompting. Do not give hirn the chance to reject your \nrequests. Better to win favors by deserving them, so that they are bestowed \nwithout your asking. \nLAW 24 187 \n188 LAW 24 Scene X \nThe great English landscape painter J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851) was \nknown for his use of color, which he applied with a brilliance and a strange \niridescence. The color in his paintings was so striking, in fact, that other \nartists never wanted his work hung next to theirs: It inevitably made every­\nthing around it seem dull. \nThe painter Sir Thomas Lawrence once had the misfortune of seeing \nTurner's masterpiece Cologne hanging in an exhibition between two works \nof his own. Lawrence complained bitterly to the gallery owner, who gave \nhirn no satisfaction: After all, someone's paintings had to hang next to \nTurner's. But Turner heard of Lawrence's complaint, and before the exhibi­\ntion opened, he toned down the brilliant golden sky in Cologne, making it as \ndull as the colors in Lawrence's works. A friend of Turner's who saw the \npainting approached the artist with a horrified look: \"What have you done \nto your picture!\" he said. \"Well, poor Lawrence was so unhappy,\" Turner \nreplied, \"and it's only larnpblack. It'll wash off after the exhibition.\" \nInterpretation \nMany of a courtier's anxieties have to do with the master, with whom most \ndangers lie. Yet it is amistake to imagine that the master is the only one to \ndetennine your fate. Your equals and subordinates play integral parts also. \nA court is a vast stew of resentments, fears, and powernd envy. You have to \nplacate everyone who might someday hann you, deflecting their resent­\nment and envy and diverting their hostility onto other people. \nTurner, eminent courtier, knew that his good fortune and farne de­\npended on his fellow painters as well as on his dealers and patrons. How \nmany of the great have been felled by envious colleagues! Better temporar­\nily to dull your brilliance than to suffer the slings and arrows of envy. \nScene XI \nWinston Churchill was an amateur artist, and after World War 11 his paint­\nings became collector's items. The American publisher Henry Luce, in \nfact, creator of Time and Lift magazines, kept one of Churchill's landscapes \nhanging in his private office in New York. \nOn a tour through the United States once, Churchill visited Luce in his \noffice, and the two men looked at the painting together. The publisher re­\nmarked, \"It's a good picture, but I think it needs something in the fore­\nground-a sheep, perhaps.\" Much to Luce's horror, Churchill 's secretary \ncalled the publisher the next day and asked hirn to have the painting sent \nto England. Luce did so, mortified that he had perhaps offended the former \nprime minister. A few days later, however, the painting was shipped back, \nbut slightly altered: a single sheep now grazed peacefully in the fore­\nground. \nInterpretation \nIn stature and farne, Churchill stood head and shoulders above Luce, but \nLuce was certainly a man of power, so let us imagine a slight equality be­\ntween them. Still, what did Churchill have to fear from an American pub­\nlisher? Why bow to the criticism of a dilettante ? \nA court-in this case the entire world of diplomats and intemational \nstatesmen, and also of the joumalists who court them-is a place of mutual \ndependence. It is unwise to insult or offend the taste of people of power, \neven if they are below or equal to you. If a man like Churchill can swallow \nthe criticisms of a man like Luce, he proves hirns elf a courtier without peer. \n(Perhaps his correction of the painting implied a certain condescension as \nweIl, but he did it so subtly that Luce did not perceive any slight.) Imitate \nChurchill: Put in the sheep. It is always beneficial to play the obliging \ncourtier, even when you are not serving a master. \nTRE DELICATE GAME OF COURTIERSHIP: A Waming \nTalleyrand was the consummate courtier, especially in serving his master \nNapoleon. When the two men were first getting to know each other, \nNapoleon once said in passing, \"I shall come to lunch at your house one of \nthese days.\" Talleyrand had a house at Auteuil, in the suburbs of Paris. \"I \nshould be delighted, mon general,\" the minister replied, \"and since my \nhouse is elose to the Bois de Boulogne, you will be able to amuse yourself \nwith a bit of shooting in the aftemoon.\" \n\"I do not like shooting,\" said Napoleon, \"But I love hunting. Are there \nany boars in the Bois de Boulogne ?\" Napoleon came from Corsica, where \nboar hunting was a great sport. By asking if there were boars in a Paris \npark, he showed hirnself still a provincial, almost a rube. Talleyrand did not \nlaugh, however, but he could not resist a practical joke on the man who \nwas now his master in politics, although not in blood and nobility, since \nTalleyrand came from an old aristocratic family. To Napoleon's question, \nthen, he simply replied, \"Very few, mon general, but I dare say you will man­\nage to find one.\" \nIt was arranged that Napoleon would arrive at Talleyrand's house the \nfollowing day at seven A.M. and would spend the moming there. The \"boar \nhunt\" would take place in the aftemoon. Throughout the moming the ex­\ncited general talked nothing but boar hunting. Meanwhile, Talleyrand se­\ncretly had his servants go to the market, buy two enormous black pigs, and \ntake them to the great park. \nAfter lunch, the hunters and their hounds set off for the Bois de \nBoulogne . At a secret signal from Talleyrand, the servants loosed one of the \npigs. \"I see aboar,\" Napoleon cried joyfully, jumping onto his horse to give \nchase. Talleyrand stayed behind. It took half an hour of galloping through \nthe park before the \"boar\" was finally captured. At the moment of triumph, \nhowever, Napoleon was approached by one of his aides, who knew the \ncreature could not possibly be aboar, and feared the general would be \nridiculed once the story got out: \"Sir,\" he told Napoleon, \"you realize of \ncourse that this is not a boar but a pig.\" \nFlying into a rage, Napoleon immediately set off at a gallop for Tal­\nleyrand's house. He realized along the way that he would now be the butt \nof many a joke, and that exploding at Talleyrand would only make hirn \nLAW 24 189 \n190 LAW 24 more ridiculous; it would be better to make a show of good humor. Still, he \ndid not hide his displeasure weIl. \nTalleyrand decided to try to soothe the general's bruised ego. He told \nNapoleon not to go back to Paris yet-he should again go hunting in the \npark. There were many rabbits there, and hunting them had been a fa­\nvorite pastime of Louis XVI. Talleyrand even offered to let Napoleon use a \nset of guns that had once belonged to Louis. With much flattery and cajol­\nery, he once again got Napoleon to agree to a hunt. \nThe party left for the park in the late aftemoon. Along the way, \nNapoleon told Talleyrand, \"I'm not Louis XVI, I surely won't kill even one \nrabbit.\" Yet that aftemoon, strangely enough, the park was teeming with \nrabbits. Napoleon killed at least fifty of them, and his mood changed from \nanger to satisfaction. At the end of his wild shooting spree, however, the \nsame aide approach ed hirn and whispered in his ear, \"To tell the truth, sir, I \nam beginning to believe these are not wild rabbits. I suspect that rascal Tal­\nleyrand has played another joke on us.\" (The aide was right: Talleyrand \nhad in fact sent his servants back to the market, where they had purchased \ndozens of rabbits and then had released them in the Bois de Boulogne.) \nNapoleon immediately mounted his horse and galloped away, this \ntime retuming straight to Paris. He later threatened Talleyrand, wamed \nhirn not to tell a soul what had happened; if he became the laughingstock \nof Paris, there would be hell to pay. \nIt took months for Napoleon to be able to trust Talleyrand again, and \nhe never totally forgave hirn his humiliation. \nInterpretation \nCourtiers are like magicians: They deceptively play with appearances, \nonly letting those around them see what they want them to see. With so \nmuch deception and manipulation afoot, it is essential to keep people from \nseeing your tricks and glimpsing your sleight of hand. \nTalleyrand was normally the Grand Wizard of Courtiership, and but \nfor Napoleon's aide, he probably would have gotten away completely with \nboth pleasing his master and having a joke at the general's expense. But \ncourtiership is a subtle art, and overlooked traps and inadvertent mistakes \ncan ruin your best tricks. Never risk being caught in your maneuvers; \nnever let people see your devices. If that happens you instantly pass in peo­\nple's perceptions from a courtier of great manners to a loathsome rogue. It \nis a delicate game you play; apply the utrnost attention to covering your \ntracks, and never let your master unmask you. \nLAW \n25 \nRE- CREATE YO URSE LF \nJUDGMENT \nDo not accept the roles that society foists on you. \nRe-create yourself by forging a new identity, one that \ncommands attention and never bores the audience.

He began his entrance into the public eye by orga­\nnizing aseries of carefully crafted and well-timed spectacl es-wild-beast \nhunts, extravagant gladiator shows, theatrical contests . On several occa­\nsions, he paid for these spectacl es out of his own pocket. To the common \nman, Julius Caesar became indelibly associated with these much-Ioved \nevents. As he slowly rose to attain the position of consul, his popularity \namong the masses served as the foundation of his power. He had created \nan image of hirnself as a great public showman. \nIn 49 B.C., Rome was on the brink of a civil war between rivalleaders, \nCaesar and Pompey. At the height of the tension, Caesar, an addict of the \nstage, attended a theatrical performance, and afterward, lost in thought, he \nwandered in the darkness back to his camp at the Rubicon, the river that \ndivides ltaly from Gaul, where he had been campaigning. To march his \narmy back into Italy across the Rubicon would mean the beginning of a \nwar with Pompey. \nBefore his staff Caesar argued both sides, forming the options like an \nactor on stage, aprecursor of Hamlet. Finally, to put his soliloquy to an \nend, he pointed to a seemingly innocent apparition at the edge of the \nriver-a very tall soldier blasting a call on a trumpet, then going across a \nbridge over the Rubicon-and pronounced, \"Let us accept this as a sign \nfrom the Gods and follow where they beckon, in vengeance on our double­\ndealing enemie s. The die is cast.\" All of this he spoke portentously and dra­\nmatically, gesturing toward the river and looking his generals in the eye. \nHe knew that these generals were uncertain in their support, but his ora­\ntory overwhelmed them with a sense of the drama of the moment, and of \nthe need to seize the time. A more prosaic speech would never have had \nthe same effect. The generals rallied to his cause; Caesar and his army \ncrossed the Rubicon and by the following year had vanqui shed Pompey, \nmaking Caesar dictator of Rome. \nIn warfare, Caesar always played the leading man with gusto. He was \nas skilIed a horseman as any of his soldiers, and took pride in outdoing \nthem in feats of bravery and endura nce. He entered battle astride the \nstrongest mount, so that his soldiers would see hirn in the thick of battle, \nurging them on, always positioning hirnself in the center, a godlike symbol \nof power and a model for them to follow. Of all the armies in Rome, Cae­\nsar's was the most devoted and loyal. His soldiers, like the common people \nwho had attended his entertainments, had come to identify with hirn and \nwith his cause. \nAfter the defeat of Pompey, the entertainments grew in scale. Nothing \nlike them had ever been seen in Rome. The chariot races became more \nspectacular, the gladiator fights more dramatic, as Caesar staged fights to \nthe death among the Roman nobility. He organiz ed enormous mock naval \nbattles on an artificial lake. Plays were performed in every Roman ward. A \ngiant new theater was built that sloped dramatically down the Tarpeian \nRock. Crowds from all over the empire flocked to these events, the roads to \nRome lined with visitors' tents. And in 45 B.C., timing his entry into the city \nfor maximum effect and surprise, Caesar brought Cleopatra back to Rome \nafter his Egyptian campaign, and staged even more extravagant public \nspectacles. \nThese events were more than devices to divert the masses; they dra­\nmatically enhanc ed the public's sense of Caesar's character, and made hirn \nseem larger than life. Caesar was the master of his public image, of which \nhe was forever aware. When he appeared before crowds he wore the most \nspectacular purple robes. He would be upstaged by no one. He was notori­\nously vain about his appearance-it was said that one reason he enjoyed \nbeing honored by the Senate and people was that on these occasions he \ncould wear a laurel wreath, hiding his baldness. Caesar was a masterful or­\nator. He knew how to say a lot by saying a little, intuited the moment to \nend a speech for maximum effect. He never failed to incorporate a surprise \ninto his public appearances-a startling announcement that would \nheighten their drama. \nImmensely popular among the Roman people, Caesar was hated and \nfeared by his rivals. On the ides of March-March 15-in the year 44 B.C., \na group of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius surrounded hirn in the \nsenate and stabbed hirn to death. Even dying, however, he kept his sense of \ndrama. Drawing the top of his gown over his face, he let go of the cloth's \nlower part so that it draped his legs, allowing hirn to die covered and de­\ncent. According to the Roman historian Suetonius , his final words to his \nold friend Brutus, who was about to deliver a second blow, were in Greek, \nand as if rehearsed for the end of a play: \"You too, my child?\" \nInterpretation \nThe Roman theater was an event for the masses, attended by crowds \nunimagina ble today. Packed into enormous auditoriums, the audience \nwould be amused by raucous comedy or moved by high tragedy. Theater \nseemed to contain the essence of life, in its concentrated, dramatic form. \nLike a religious ritual, it had a powerful, instant appeal to the common \nman. \nJulius Caesar was perhaps the first public figure to understand the vital \nlink between power and theater. This was because of his own obsessive in­\nterest in drama. He sublimated this interest by making bimself an actor and \ndirector on the world stage. He said his lines as if they had been scripted ; \nhe gestured and moved through a crowd with a constant sense of how he \nappeared to his audience. He incorporated surprise into his repertoire, \nbuilding drama into bis speeches, staging into his public appeara nces. His \ngestures were broad enough for the common man to grasp them instantly. \nHe became immensely popular .. \nCaesar set the ideal for all leaders and people of power. Like hirn, you \nmust learn to enlarge YOUf actions through dramatic techniques such as \nLAW 25 198 \n194 LAW 25 surprise, suspense, the creation of sympathy, and symbolic identification. \nAlso like hirn, you must be constantly aware of your audience---of what \nwill please them and what will bore them. You must arrange to place your­\nself at the center, to command attention, and never to be upstaged at any \ncost. \nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II \nIn the year 1831, a young woman named Aurore Dupin Dudevant left her \nhusband and family in the provinces and moved to Paris. She wanted to be \na writer; marriage, she feIt, was worse than prison, for it left her neither the \ntime nor the freedom to pursue her passion. In Paris she would establish \nher independence and make her living by writing. \nSoon after Dudevant arrived in the capital, however, she had to con­\nfront certain harsh realities. To have any degree of freedom in Paris you \nhad to have money. For a woman, money could only come through mar­\nriage or prostitution. No woman had ever come close to making a living by \nwriting. Women wrote as a hobby, supported by their husbands, or by an \ninheritance. In fact when Dudevant first showed her writing to an editor, \nhe told her, \"You should make babies, Madame, not literature.\" \nClearly Dudevant had come to Paris to attempt the impossible. In the \nend, though, she came up with a strategy to do what no woman had ever \ndone-a strategy to re-create herself completely, forging a public image of \nher own making. Women writers before her had been forced into a ready­\nmade role, that of the second-ra te artist who wrote mostly for other \nwomen. Dudevant decided that if she had to playa role, she would turn the \ngame around: She would play the part of a man. \nIn 1832 a publisher accepted Dudevant's first major novel, Indiana. \nShe had chosen to publish it under a pseudonym, \"George Sand,\" and all \nof Paris assumed this impressive new writer was male. Dudevant had \nsometimes worn men's clothes before creating \"George Sand\" (she had al­\nways found men's shirts and riding breeches more comforta ble); now, as \na public figure, she exaggerated the image. She added long men's coats, \ngray hats, heavy boots, and dandyish cravats to her wardrobe. She smoked \ncigars and in conversation expressed herself like a man, unafraid to domi­\nnate the conversation or to use a saucy word. \nThis strange \"malelfernale\" writer fascinated the public. And unlike \nother women writers, Sand found herself accepted into the clique of male \nartists. She drank and smoked with them, even carried on affairs with the \nmost famous artists of Europe---Musset, Liszt, Chopin. It was she who did \nthe wooing, and also the abandoning-she moved on at her discretion. \nThose who knew Sand well understood that her male persona pro­\ntected her from the public's prying eyes. Out in the world, she enjoyed \nplaying the part to the extreme; in private she remained herself. She also \nrealized that the character of \"George Sand\" could grow stale or pre­\ndictable, and to avoid this she would every now and then dramatically alter \nthe character she had create d; instead of conducting affairs with famous \nmen, she would begin meddling in politics, Ieading demonstrat ions, inspir­\ning student rebellions. No one would dictate to her the limits of the charac­\nter she had created. Long after she died, and after most people had stopped \nreading her noveIs, the Iarger-than- life theatricality of that character has \neontinued to fascinate and inspire. \nInterpretation \nThroughout Sand's public life, acquainta nces and other artists who spent \ntime in her company had the feeling they were in the presence of a man. \nBut in her journals and to her dosest friends, such as Gustave Flaubert, she \neonfessed that she had no desire to be a man, but was playing a part for \npublic consumption. What she really wanted was the power to determine \nher own character. She refused the limits her society would have set on her. \nShe did not attain her power, however, by being herself; instead she cre­\nated a persona that she could constantly adapt to her own desires, a per­\nsona that attracted attention and gave her presence. \nUnderstand this: The world wants to assign you a role in life. And \nonee you accept that role you are doomed. Your power is lirnited to the \ntiny amount allotted to the role you have selected or have been forced to \nassurne. An actor, on the other hand, plays many roles. Enjoy that protean \npower, and if it is beyond you, at least forge a new identity, one of YOUf \nown making, one that has had no boundaries assigned to it by an envious \nand resentful world. This act of defiance is Promet hean: It makes you re­\nsponsible for your own creation. \nYour new identity will protect you from the world precisely because it \nis not \"you\"; it is a costume you put on and take off. You need not take it \npersonally. And your new identity sets you apart, gives you theatrical pres­\nence. Those in the back rows can see you and hear you. Those in the front \nrows marvel at your audacity. \nDo not people talk in soc iety of a man being a great actor? They do not mean by \nthat that he feets, but that he excels in simula ting, thou gh he feets noth ing. \nDenis Diderot, 1713-1 784 \nKEYS TO POWER \nThe character you seem to have been born with is not necessarily who you \nare; beyond the characteristics you have inherited, YOUf parents, your \nfriends, and your peers have helped to shape your personality. The \nPromethean task of the powerful is to take control of the process, to stop al­\nlowing others that ability to limit and mold them. Remake YOUfself into a \neharacter of power. Working on yourself like day should be one of YOUf \ngreatest and most pleasurable Iife tasks. It makes you in essence an artist­\nan artist creating YOUfself. \nIn fact, the idea of self-creation comes from the world of art. For thou-\nLAW 25 195 \n196 LAW 25 sands of years, only kings and the highest courtiers had the freedom to \nshape their public image and determine their own identity. Similarly, only \nkings and the wealthiest lords could contemplate their own image in art, \nand consciously alter it. The rest of mankind played the limited role that \nsociety demanded of them, and had little self-consciousne ss. \nA shift in this condition can be detected in Veläzquez's painting Las \nMeninas, made in 1656. The artist appears at the left of the canvas, standing \nbefore a painting that he is in the process of creating, but that has its back \nto us-we cannot see it. Beside hirn stands a princess, her attendants, and \none of the court dwarves, all watching hirn work. The people posing for the \npainting are not directly visible, but we can see them in tiny reflections in a \nmirror on the back wall-the king and queen of Spain, who must be sitting \nsomewhere in the foreground, outside the picture. \nThe painting represents a dramatic change in the dynamics of power \nand the ability to determine one's own position in society. For Veläzquez, \nthe artist, is far more prominently positioned than the king and queen. In a \nsense he is more powerful than they are, since he is clearly the one control­\nling the image-their image. Veläzquez no longer saw hirnself as the slav­\nish, dependent artist. He had remade hirnself into a man of power. And \nindeed the first people other than aristocrats to play openly with their \nimage in Western society were artists and writers, and later on dandies and \nbohemians. Today the concept of self-creation has slowly filtered down to \nthe rest of society, and has become an ideal to aspire to. Like Veläzquez, \nyou must demand for yourself the power to determine your position in the \npainting, and to create your own image. \nThe first step in the process of self-creation is self-consciousness­\nbeing aware of yourself as an actor and taking control of your appearance \nand emotions. As Diderot said, the bad actor is the one who is always sin­\ncere. People who wear their hearts on their sleeves out in society are tire­\nsome and embarrassing. Their sincerity notwithstanding, it is hard to take \nthem seriously. Those who cry in public may temporarily elicit sympathy, \nbut sympathy so on turns to scorn and irritation at their self­\nobsessiveness-they are crying to get attention, we feel, and a malicious \npart of us wants to deny them the satisfaction. \nGood actors control themselves better. They can play sincere and \nheartfelt, can affect a tear and a compassionate look at will, but they don't \nhave to feel it. They externalize emotion in a form that others can und er­\nstand. Method acting is fatal in the real world. No mler or leader could \npossibly play the part if all of the emotions he showed had to be real. So \nleam self-control . Adopt the plasticity of the actor, who can mold his or her \nface to the emotion required. \nThe second step in the process of self-creation is a variation on the \nGeorge Sand strategy: the creation of a memorable character, one that \ncompels attention, that stands out above the other players on the stage. \nThis was the game Abraham Lincoln played. The homespun, common \ncountry man, he knew, was a kind of president that America had never had \nbut would delight in electing. Although many of these qualit ies came natu­\nrally to hirn, he played them up-the hat and clothes, the beard. (No presi­\ndent before hirn had worn a beard.) Lincoln was also the first president to \nuse photogra phs to spread his image, helping to create the icon of the \n\"homespun president.\" \nGood drama, however, needs more than an interesting appeara nce, or \na singl e stand-out moment. Drama takes place over time--it is an unfold­\ning event. Rhythm and timing are critical. One of the most important ele­\nments in the rhythm of drama is suspense. Houdini for instance, could \nsometimes complete his escape acts in secon ds-but he drew them out to \nminute s, to make the aud ience sweat. \nThe key to keeping the audienc e on the edge of their seats is letting \nevents unfold slowly, then speeding them up at the right moment, accord­\ning to a pattern and tempo that you control. Great mlers from Nap oleon to \nMao Tse-tung have used theatrical timing to surprise and divert their pub­\nIic. Franklin Delano Roosevelt understood the importa nce of staging politi­\ncal events in a particular order and rhythm. \nAt the time of his 1932 president ial election, the United States was in \nthe midst of a dire economic crisis. Banks were failing at an alarming rate. \nShortly after winning the election, Roosevelt went into a kind of retreat. \nHe said nothing about his plans or his cabinet appointm ents. He even re­\nfused to meet the sitting president, Herbert Hoover, to discuss the transi­\ntion. By the time of Roosevelt's inauguration the country was in astate of \nhigh anxiety. \nIn his inaugural add ress, Roosevelt shifted gea rs. He made a powernd \nspeech, making it clear that he intended to lead the country in a completely \nnew direct ion, sweeping away the timid ge stures of his predecessors. From \nthen on the pace of his speeches and public decision s-cabinet appoint­\nments, bold legislation-unf olded at an incredibly rapid rate . The period \nafter the inauguration became known as the \"Hundred Days,\" and its suc­\ncess in altering the country's mood partly stemmed from Roosevelt's clever \npacing and use of dramatic contrast. He held his audience in suspense, \nthen hit them with a series of bold ge stures that seemed all the more mo­\nmentous because they came from nowhere. You must leam to orchestrate \nevents in a similar manner, never revealing all your cards at once, but un­\nfolding them in a way that height ens their dramatic effe ct. \nBesides covering a multitude of sins, good drama can also confuse and \ndeceive your enemy. During Wo rld War II, the German playwright Bertolt \nBrecht worked in Hollywood as a scree nwriter. After the war he was called \nbefore the House Committee on Un-American Activit ies for his supp osed \nCommunist sympat hies. Other writers who had been called to testify \nplanned to humiliate the committee members with an angry emotional \nstand. Brecht was wiser: He would play the committee like a violin, charm­\ning them while fooling them as weIl. He carefully rehearsed his responses, \nand brought along some props, notably a cigar on which he puffed away, \nknowing the head of the committee liked ciga rs. And indeed he proceeded \nLAW 25 197 \n198 LAW 25 to beguile the committee with well-crafted responses that were ambiguous, \nfunny, and double-edged. Instead of an angry, heartfelt tirade, he ran cir­\ncles around them with a staged production, and they let hirn off scot-free. \nOther dramatic effects for your repertoire include the beau geste, an \naction at a climactic moment that symbolizes your triumph or your bold­\nness. Caesar's dramatic crossing of the Rubicon was a beau geste--a move \nthat dazzled the soldiers and gave hirn heroic proporti ons. You must also \nappreciate the importance of stage entranc es and exits. When Cleopa tra \nfirst met Caesar in Egypt, she arrived rolled up in a carpet, which she \narranged to have unfurled at his feet. George Washington twice left power \nwith flourish and fanfare (first as a general, then as a president who refused \nto sit for a third term), showing he knew how to make the moment count, \ndramatically and symbolica lly. Your own entrances and exits should be \ncrafted and planned as carefully. \nRememb er that overacting can be counterproductiv e--it is another \nway of spending too much effort trying to attract attention. The actor \nRichard Burton discovered early in his career that by standing totally still \nonstage, he drew attention to hirnself and away from the other actors. It is \nless what you do that matters, clearly, than how you do it-your graceful­\nness and imposing stillness on the sodal stage count for more than overdo­\ning your part and moving around too much. \nFinally: Learn to play many roles, to be whatever the moment re­\nquires. Adapt your mask to the situation-be protean in the faces you wear. \nBismarck played this game to perfection: To a liberal he was a liberal, to a \nhawk he was a hawk. He could not be grasped, and what cannot be \ngrasped cannot be consumed. \n1 mag e \nThe Creek Sea-God Proteus. \nHis power came from his ability tb \nchange shape at will, to be whatever the \nmoment required. When Menelaus, brother \nof Agamemnon, tried to seize hirn, Proteus \ntransformed hirnself into a lion, then a serpent, a \npanther, aboar, running water, and finally a leafy tree. \nAuthority: Know how to be all things to all men. A discreet Proteus-a \nscholar among scholars, a saint among saints. That is the art of winning over \neveryone, far like attracts like. Take note of temperaments and adapt your­\nself to that of each person you meet-follow the lead of the serious and \njovial in turn, changing your mood discreetly. (Baltasar Craciän, 1601-1658) \nREVERSAL \nThere can really be no reversal to this criticallaw: Bad theater is bad the­\nater. Even appearing natural requires art-in other words, acting. Bad act­\ning only creates embarrassment. Of course you should not be too \ndramatic-avoid the histrionic gest ure. But that is simply bad theater any­\nway, since it violates centuries-old dramatic laws against overacting. In \nessence there is no revers al to this law. \nLAW 25 199 \n200 LAW \n26 \nKEEP YO UR RA NDS CL EAN \nJUDGMENT \nYou must seem a paragon of civility and efficiency: \nYour hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty \ndeeds.

Seeking to extend his \npower base and to rid hirnself of the last of his rivals, Ts'ao Ts'ao began a \ncampaign to take control of the strategically vital Central Plain. During the \nsiege of a key city, he slightly miscalculated the timing for supplies of grain \nto arrive from the capital. As he waited for the shipment to come in, the \narmy ran low on food, and Ts'ao Ts'ao was forced to order the chief of \ncommissariat to reduce its rations. \nTs'ao Ts'ao kept a tight rein on the army, and ran a network of inform­\ners. His spies soon reported that the men were complaining, grumbling \ntimt he was living weIl while they themselves had barely enough to eat. \nPerhaps Ts'ao Ts'ao was keeping the food for hirnself, they murmured. If \nthe grumbling spread, Ts'ao Ts'ao could have a mutiny on his hands. He \nsummoned the chief of commissa riat to his tent. \n\"I want to ask you to lend me something, and you must not refuse,\" \nTs'ao Ts'ao told the chief. \"What is it?\" the chief replied. \"I want the loan of \nyour head to show to the troops,\" said Ts'ao Ts'ao. \"But I've done nothing \nwrong!\" cried the chief. \"I know,\" said Ts'ao Ts'ao with a sigh, ;'but if I do \nnot put you to death, there will be a mutiny. Do not grieve-after you're \ngone, I'Il look after your farnily.\" Put this way, the request left the chief no \nchoice, so he resigned hirnself to his fate and was beheaded that very day. \nSeeing his head on public display, the soldiers stopped grumbling. Some \nsaw through Ts'ao Ts'ao's ge sture, but kept quiet, stunned and intimidated \nby his violence. And most accepted his version of who was to bIarne, pre­\nferring to believe in his wisdom and fairness than in his incompetence and \ncruelty. \nInterpretation \nTs'ao Ts'ao carne to power in an extremely tumultuous time. In the struggle \nfor supremacy in the crumbling Han Empire, enemies had emerged from \nall sides. The battle for the Central Plain had proven more difficult than he \nimagined, and money and provisions were a constant concern. No wonder \nthat under such stress, he had forgotten to order supplies in time. \nOnce it became clear that the delay was a critical mistake, and that the \narmy was seething with mutiny, Ts'ao Ts'ao had two options: apology and \nexcuses, or a scapegoat.

Without police or any disciplining force, it had descended into \nlawlessness, whole areas being ruled by robbers and feuding families. \nTo establish order, Cesare appointed a lieutenant general of the region­\nRemirro qe Orco, \"a cruel and vigorous man,\" according to Niccolö \nMachiav elli. Cesare gave de Orco absolute powers. \nWith energy and violence, de Orco established a severe, brutal justice \nin Romagna, and so on rid it of almost all of its lawless elemen ts. But in his \nzeal he sometimes went too far, and after a couple of years the local popu­\nlation resented and even hated hirn. In December of 1502, Cesare took de­\ncisive action. He first let it be known that he had not approved of de Orco's \ncruel and violent deeds, which stemmed from the lieutenant' s brutal na­\nture. Then, on December 22, he imprisoned de Orco in the town of Ce­\nsena, and the day after Christmas the townspeople awoke to find a strange \nspectade in the middle ofthe piazza: de Orco's headless body, dressed in a \nlavish suit with a purple cape, the head impaled beside it on a pike, the \nbloody knife and executio ner's block laid out beside the head. As Machi­\navelli conclude d his comments on the affair, \"The ferocity of this scene left \nthe people at once stunned and satisfied.\" \nInterpretation \nCesare Borgia was a master player in the game of power. Always planning \nseveral moves ahead, he set his opponents the cleverest traps. For this \nMachiavelli honored rum above all others in The Prince. \nCesare foresaw the future with amazing clarity in Romagna: Only bru­\ntal justice would bring order to the region. The process would take several \nyears, and at first the people would welcome it. But it would soon make \nmany enemies, and the citizens would come to resent the imposition of \nsuch unforgiving justice, especially by outsiders. Cesare hirnself, then, \ncould not be seen as the agent of this justice-the people's hatred would \ncause too many problems in the future . And so he chose the one man who \ncould do the dirty work, knowing in advance that once the task was done \nhe would have to display de Orco's head on a pike. The scapegoat in this \ncase had been planned fr om the beginning. \nWith Ts'ao Ts'ao, the scapegoat was an entirely innocent man; in the \nRomagna, he was the offensive weapon in Cesare's arsenal that let hirn get \nthe dirty work done without bloodying his own hands. With this second \nkind of scapegoat it is wise to separate yourself from the hatchet man at \nsome point, either leaving hirn dangling in the wind or, like Cesare, even \nmaking yourself the one to bring hirn to justice. Not only are you free of in­\nvolvement in the problem, you can appear as the one who cleaned it up. \nThe Athenians regularly maintained a number of degraded and useless \nbeings at the public expense; and when any calamit y, such as plague, \ndrough t, or famine, befeil the cit y ... [these scapego atsl were led about ... \nand then sacrificed, apparently by being stoned outside the city. \nThe Colden Bough , Sir!ames George Frazer, 1854-1 941 \nKEYS TO POWER \nThe use of scapegoats is as old as civilization itself, and examples of it can \nbe found in cultures around the world. The main idea behind these sacri­\nfices is the shifting of guilt and sin to an outside figure-ob ject, animal, or \nman-which is then banished or destroyed. The Hebrews used to take a \nlive goat (hence the term \"scapegoat\") upon whose head the priest would \nlay both hands while confessing the sins of the Children of Israel. Having \nthus had those sins transferred to it, the be ast would be led away and aban­\ndoned in the wildemess. With the Athenians and the Aztecs, the scapegoat \nwas human, often a person fed and raised for the purpose. Since famine \nand plague were thought to be visited on humans by the gods, in punish­\nment for wrongdoing, the people suffered not only from the famine and \nplague themselves but from blame and guilt. They freed themselves of guilt \nby transferring it to an innocent person, whose death was intended to sat­\nisfy the divine powers and banish the evil from their midst. \nIt is an extremely human response to not look inward after amistake \nor crime, but rather to look outward and to affix blame and guilt on a con­\nvenient object. When the plague was ravaging Thebes, Oedipus looked \neverywhere for its cause, everywhere except inside hirnself and his own sin \nof incest, which had so offended the gods and occasioned the plague. This \nprofound need to exteriorize one's guilt, to project it on another person or \nobject, has an immense power, which the clever know how to hamess. Sac-\nLAW 26 203 \n204 LAW 26 rifice is a ritual, perhaps the most ancient ritual of all; ritual too is a well­\nspring of power. In the killing of de Orco, note Cesare's symbolic and ritu­\nalistic display of his body. By framing it in this dramatic way he focused \nguilt outward. The citizens of Romagna responded instantly. Because it \ncomes so naturally to us to look outward rather than inward, we readily ac­\ncept the scapegoat' s guilt. \nThe bloody sacrifice of the scapegoat seems a barbaric relic of the \npast, but the practice lives on to this day, if indirectly and symbolically; \nsince power depends on appearan ces, and those in power must seem never \nto make mistake s, the use of scapegoats is as popular as ever. What modem \nleader will take respons ibility for his blunders? He searches out others \nto blame, a scapegoat to sacrifice. When Mao Tse-tung' s Cultural Rev­\nolution failed miserably, he made no apologies or excuses to the Chinese \npeople; instead, like Ts'ao Ts'ao before hirn, he offered up scapegoats, in­\ndu ding his own personal secretary and high-ranking memher of the Party, \neh' en Po-ta. \nFranklin D. Roosevelt had a reputation for honesty and fairness. \nThroughout his career, however, he faced many situations in which being \nthe nice guy would have spelled political disaster-yet he could not be \nseen as the agent of any foul play. For twenty years, then, his secretary, \nLouis Howe, played the role de Orco had. He handle d the backro om deals, \nthe manipulation of the press, the underhanded campaign maneu vers. And \nwhenever amistake was committe d, or a dirty trick contradicting Roo­\nsevelt's carefully crafted image became public, Howe served as the scape­\ngoat, and never complained. \nBesides conveniently shifting biarne, a scapegoat can serve as a wam­\ning to others. In 1631 a plot was hatched to oust France's Cardinal Riche­\nlieu from power, a plot that became known as \"The Day of the Dupes.\" It \nalmost succeeded, since it involved the upper echelons of govemment, in­\nduding the queen mother. But through luck and his own connivances, \nRichelieu survived. \nOne of the key conspirators was a man named Marillac, the keeper of \nthe seals. Richelieu could not imprison him without implicating the queen \nmother, an extremely dangerous tactic, so he targeted Marillac's brother, a \nmarshai in the army. This man had no involvement in the plot. Richelieu, \nhowever, afraid that other conspiracies might be in the air, especially in the \narmy, decided to set an example. He tried the brother on trumped-up \ncharges and had hirn executed. In this way he indirectly punished the real \nperpetrator, who had thought hirnself protected, and warned any future \nconspirators that he would not shrink from sacrificing the innocent to pro-\ntect his own power. , \nIn fact it is often wise to choose the most i rbocent victim possible as a \nsacrificial goat. Such people will not be powerful enough to fight you, and \ntheir naive protests may be seen as protesting too much-may be seen, in \nother words, as a sign of their guilt. Be careful, however, not to create a \nmartyr. It is important that you remain the victim, the poor leader betrayed \nby the incompetence of those around you. If the scapegoat appears too \nweak and his punishment too cruel, you may end up the victim of your \nown device. Sometimes you should find a more powerful scapegoat-one \nwho will elicit less sympathy in the long run. \nIn this vein, history has time and again shown the value of using a \nelose associate as a scapegoat. This is known as the \"fall of the favorite.\" \nMost kings had a personal favorite at court, a man whom they singled out, \nsometimes for no apparent reason, and lavished with favors and attention. \nBut this court favorite could serve as a convenient scapegoat in case of a \nthreat to the king's reputation. The public would readily believe in the \nscapegoat's guilt-why would the king sacrifice his favorite unless he were \nguilty? And the other courtiers, resentful of the favorite anyway, would re­\njoice at his downfall. The king, meanwhi le, would rid hirnself of a man who \nby that time had probably learned too much about hirn, perhaps becoming \narrogant and even disdainful of hirn. Choosing a elose associate as a scape­\ngoat has the same value as the \"fall of the favorite.\" You may lose a friend \nor aide, but in the long-term sc heme of things, it is more important to hide \nyour mistakes than to hold on to someone who one day will probably turn \nagainst you. Besides, you can always find a new favorite to take hi� place. \nImage: The Innocent Goat. On \nthe Day of Atonement, the high \npriest brings the goat into the \ntemple, places his hands on its \nhead, and confesses the peo­\nple's sins, transferring guilt to \nthe guiltless beast, which is \nthen led to the wildemess and \nabandoned, the people's sins \nand blame vanishing with hirn. \nAuthority: Folly consists not in committing Folly, but in being \nincapable of concealing it. All men make mistakes, but the wise \nconceal the blunders they have made, while fools make them pub­\nlic. Reputation depends more on what is hidden than on what is \nseen. If you can't be good, be careful.

One of the daughters, \nBerenice, emerged as the leader of the rebellion, and to ensure that she \nwould now rule Egypt alone, she imprisoned her other sisters and mur­\ndered her own husband. This may have been necessary as a practical step \nto secure her rule. But that a member of the royal family, a queen no less, \nwould so overtly exact such violence on her own family horrified her sub­\njects and stirred up powerful opposit ion. Four years later this oppo sition \nwas able to return Ptolemy to power, and he promptly had Berenice and \nthe other eIder sisters beheaded. \nIn 51 B.C. Ptolemy died, leaving four remaining children as heirs. As \nwas the tradition in Egypt, the eldest son, Ptolemy XIII (only ten at the \ntime) , married the eIder sister, Cleopatra (now eighteen), and the couple \ntook the throne together as king and queen. None of the four children feIt \nsatisfied with this; everyone, including Cleopatra, wanted more power. A \nstruggle emerged between Cleopa tra and Ptolemy, each trying to push the \nother to the side. \nIn 48 B.C., with the help of a government faction that feared Cleopa­\ntra's ambiti ons, Ptolemy was able to force his sister to flee the country, \nleaving hirnself as sole ruler. In exile, Cleopa tra scheme d. She wanted to \nrule alone and to restore Egypt to its past glory, a goal she feIt none of her \nother siblings could achieve ; yet as long as they were alive, she could not \nrealizeher dream. And the example of Berenice had made it clear that no \none would serve a queen who was seen murdering her own kind. Even \nPtolemy XIII had not dared murder Cleopa tra, although he knew she \nwould plot against hirn from abroad. \nWithin a year after Cleopatra's banishment, the Roman dictator Julius \nCaesar arrived in Egypt, determined to make the country a Roman colony, \nCleopa tra saw her chance: Reentering Egypt in disguise, she traveled hun­\ndreds of miles to reach Caesar in Alexandria. Legend has it that she had \nherself smuggled into his presence rolled up inside a carpet, which was \ngracefully unfurled at his feet, revealing the young queen. Cleopatra imme­\ndiately went to work on the Roman. She appealed to his love of spectacle \nand his interest in Egyptian history, and poured on her feminine charms . \nCaesar so on succumbed and restored Cleopa tra to the throne. \nCleopatra's siblings seethed-she had outmaneuvered them. Ptolemy \nXIII would not wait to see what happened next: From his palace in \nAlexandria, he summoned a great army to march on the city and attack \nCaesar. In response, Caesar immediately put Ptolemy and the rest of the \nfamily under house arrest. But Cleopatra's younger sister Arsinoe escaped \nfrom the palace and placed herself at the head of the approaching Egyptian \ntroops, proclaiming herself queen of Egypt. Now Cleopatra finally saw her \nchance: She convinced Caesar to release Ptolemy from house arrest, under \nthe agreement that he would broker a truce. Of course she knew he would \ndo the opposite-that he would fight Arsinoe for control of the Egyptian \narmy. But this was to Cleopatra's benefit, for it would divide the royal fam­\nily. Better still, it would give Caesar the chance to defeat and kill her sib­\nlings in battle. \nReinforced by troops from Rome, Caesar swiftly defeated the rebels. \nIn the Egyptian s' retreat, Ptolemy drowned in the Nile. Caesar captured \nArsinoe and had her sent to Rome as a prisoner. He also executed the nu­\nmerous enemies who had conspired against Cleopatra, and imprisoned \nothers who had opposed her. To reinforce her position as uncontested \nqueen, Cleopatra now married the only sibling left, Ptolemy XIV -only \neleven at the time, and the weakest of the lot. Four years later Ptolemy \nmysteriously died, of poison. \nIn 41 B.C., Cleopatra employed on a second Roman leader, Marc \nAntony, the same tactics she had used so weIl on Julius Caesar. After se­\nducing hirn, she hin ted to hirn that her sister Arsinoe, still a prisoner in \nRome, had conspired to destroy hirn. Marc Antony believed her and \npromptly had Arsi noe execute d, thereby getting rid of the last of the sib­\nlings who had posed such a threat to Cleopatra. \nInterpretation \nLegend has it that Cleopatra succeeded through her seductive charms, but \nin reality her power came from an ability to get people to do her bidding \nwithout realizing they were being manipula ted. Caesar and Antony not \nonly rid her of her most dangerous siblings-Pto lemy XIII and Arsinoe­\nthey decimated alt of her enemies, in both the govemment and the mili­\ntary. The two men became her cat's-paws. They entered the fire for her, \ndid the ugly b� necessary work, while shielding her from appearing as the \ndestroyer of her\\iblings and fellow Egyptians. And in the end, both men \nacquiesced to herdesire to rule Egypt not as a Roman colony but as an in­\ndependent allied kingdom. And they did all this for her without realizing \nhow she had manipulated them. This was persuasion of the subtlest and \nmost powerful kind. and crammed it in his \njaw. \nNow came the shining \nMistress of the fane, \nAnd affin haste the \ntwo marauders \nscampered. \nTom for his share of \nthe plunder had the \npain, \nWhilst Pug his palate \nwith the dainties \npampered. \nFAHLES, \nJEAN DE LA FONTAINE, \n1621� l695 \nTlIE CIWI\\-IIE.\"'.

In 1927 Chiang Kai-shek, \nthe Nationalist leader, vowed to kill every last Communist, and over the \nnext few years he nearly accomplished his task, pushing his enemies hard \nuntil, in 1934-1935, he forced them into the Long March, a six-thousand­\nmile retreat from the southeast to the remote northwest, through harsh ter­\nrain, in which most of their ranks were decimate d. In late 1936 Chiang \nplanned one last offensive to wipe them out, but he was caught in a mutiny: \nHis own soldiers captured hirn and turned hirn over to the Communists. \nNow he could only expect the worst \nMeanwhil e, however, the Japanese began an invasion of China, and \nmuch to Chiang's surprise, instead of killing hirn the Communist leader, \nMao Tse-tung, proposed adeal: The Communists would let hirn go, and \nwould recognize hirn as commander of their forces as weIl as his, if he \nwould agree to fight alongside them against their common enemy. Chiang \nhad expected torture and execution; now he could not believe his luck. \nHow soft these Reds had become. Without having to fight a rearguard ac­\ntion against the Communists, he knew he could beat the Japanese, and \nthen a few years down the line he would turn around and destroy the Reds \nwith ease. He had nothing to lose and everything to gain by agreeing to \ntheir terms. \nThe Communists proceeded to fight the J apanese in their usual fash­\nion, with hit-and-run guerrilla tact ics, while the Nationalists f<>ught a more \nconventional war, Together, after several years, they succeeded in evicting \nthe Japanese. Now, however, Chiang finally understood what Mao had re­\nally planned. His own army had met the brunt of the Japanese artillery, \nwas greatly weakened, and would take a few years to recover. The Com­\nmunists, meanwhile, had not only avoided any direct hits from the Japa­\nnese, they had used the time to recoup their strength, and to spread out \nand gain pockets of influence all over China. As so on as the war against the \nJapanese ended, the civil war started again-but this time the Communists \nenveloped the weakened Nationalists and slowly beat them into submis­\nsion. The Japanese had served as Mao's cat's-paw, inadvertently ploughing \nthe fields for the Communists and making possible their victory over Chi­\nang Kai-shek. \nInterpretation \nMost leaders who had taken as powerful an enemy as Chiang Kai-shek \nprisoner would have made sure to kill hirn. But in doing so they would \nhave lost the chance Mao exploited. Without the experienced Chiang as \nleader of the Nationalists, the fight to drive the Japanese out might have \nlasted much longer, with devastating results. Mao was far too clever to let \nanger spoil the chance to kill two birds with one stone. In essence, Mao \nused two cat's-paws to help hirn attain total victo ry. First, he cleverly baited \nChiang into taking charge of the war against the Japanese. Mao knew the \nNationalists led by Chiang would do most of the hard fighting and would \nsucceed in pushing the Japanese out of China, if they did not have to con­\ncern themselves with fighting the Communists at the same time. The Na­\ntionalists, then, were the first cat's-paw, used to evict the Japanese. But \nMao also knew that in the process of leading the war against the invaders, \nthe Japanese artillery and air support would decimate the conventional \nforces of the Nationalists, doing damage it could take the Communists \ndecades to inflict. Why waste time and lives if the J apanese could do the \njob quickly? It was this wise policy of using one cat's-paw after another that \nallowed the Communists to prevail. \nThere are two uses of the cat's-paw: to save appeara nces, as Cleopatra \ndid, and to save energy and effort. The latter case in particular demands \nthat you plan several moves in advance, realizing that a temporary move \nbackward (letting Chiang go, say) can lead to a giant leap forward. If you \nare temporarily weakened and need time to recover, it will often serve you \nweIl to use those around you both as a screen to hide your intentions and \nas a cat's-paw to do your work for you. Look for a powerful third party who \nshares an enemy with you (if for different reasons) , then take advantage of \ntheir superior power to deal blows which would have cost you much more \nenergy, since you are weaker. You can even gently guide them into ho stili­\nties. Always search out the overly aggressive as potential cat's-pa ws-th ey \nare often more than willing to get into a fight, and you can choose just the \nright fight for your purposes. \nOBSER VANCE OF THE LAW III \nKuriyama Daizen was an adept of Cha-no-yu (Hot Water for Tea, the \nJapanese tea ceremony) and a student of the teachings of the great tea mas­\nter Sen no Rikyu.

Yet if Daizen offered to help Soemon pay back the loan, he \nwould refuse, out of pride, and might even be offended. \nOne day Daizen visited his friend, and after touring the garden and \nlooking at Soemon's prized peonies, they retired to his reception room. \nHere Daizen saw a painting by the master Kano Tennyu.

This may give the doer a certain power, but it is apower that \nwill eventually self-destruct, for it will stir up resentrnent and resistance . A \nfavor done indirectly and elegantly has ten times more power. Daizen \nknew a direct approach would only have offended Soemon. By letting his \nfriend give hirn the painting, however, he made Soemon feel that he too \nhad pleased his friend with a gift. In the end, all three parties emerged from \nthe encounter feeling fulfilled in their own way. \nIn essence, Daizen made hirnself the cat's-paw, the tool to take the \nehestnuts out of the fire. He must have feIt some pain in losing the vase, but \nhe gained not only the painting but, more important, the power of the \neourtier. The courtier uses his gloved hand to soften any blows against hirn, \ndisguise his scars, and make the act of rescue more elegant and clean. By \nhelping others, the courtier eventually helps hirnself. Daizen's example \nprovides the paradigm for every favor done between friends and peers: \nnever impose your favors. Search out ways to make yourself the cat's-paw, \nindirectly extricating your friends from distress without imposing yourself \nor making them feel obligated to you. \nOne shouZd not be too straightforward. Go and see the forest. \nThe straight trees are cut down, the crooked ones are Zeft stan ding. \nKautil ya, Indian phil osopher, third centur y B.r:. \nKEYS TO POWER \nAs aleader you may imagine that constant diligence, and the appearance \nof working harder than anyone else, signify power. Actually, though, they \nhave the opposite effect: They imply weakness. Why are you working so \nhard? Perhaps you are incompetent, and have to put in extra effort just to \nkeep up; perhaps you are one of those people who does not know how to \ndelegate, and has to meddle in everything. The truly powernd, on the other \nhand, seem never to be in a hurry or overburdened. While others work \ntheir fingers to the bone, they take their leisure. They know how to find the \nright people to put in the effort while they save their energy and keep their \nhands out of the fire. Similarly, you may believe that by taking on the dirty \nwork yourself, involving yourself directly in unpleasant actions, you im­\npose your power and instill fear. In fact you make yourself look ugly, and \nabusive of your high position. Truly powernd people keep their hands \nclean. Only good things surround them, and the only announcements they \nmake are of glorious achievements . \nYou will often find it necessa ry, of course, to expend energy, or to ef­\nfeet an evil but necessa ry action. But you must never appear to be this ac­\ntion's agent. Find a cat's-pa w. Develop the arts of finding, using, and, in \ntime, getting rid of these people when their cat's-paw role has been ful­\nfilled. \nOn the eve of an important river battle, the great third-century Chi­\nnese strategist Chuko Liang found hirnself falsely accused of secretly work­\ning for the other side. As proof of his loyalty, his commander ordered hirn \nto produce 100,000 arrows for the army within three days, or be put to \ndeath. Instead of trying to manufacture the arrows, an impossible task, \nLiang took a dozen boats and had bundles of straw lashed to their sides. In \nthe late afternoon, when mist always blanketed the river, he floated the \nboats toward the enemy camp. Fearing a trap from the wily Chuko Liang, \nthe enemy did not attack the barely visible boats with boats of their own, your relations \neollapsed and fell at my \nfeet when I mentioned \nyour captivity. ·· \nAs soon as these words \nwere spoken the \nmerchan t\"s bird \neollapsed and fell to \nthe bo/tom ofthe eage. \n\"The news of his kins­\nman's death has killed \nhim. 100,\" thought the \nmerehant.

And how \nthe message, the \nsuggestion of how to \nbehave in order to free \nmyself, was transmitted \nto me through you, my \ncaptor.\" And he flew \naway, free at last. \n[ALES OF TIlE \nDERVlSHE S, \nIDRIES SHAH, 1967 \nLAW 26 211 \n1l\\\\\\J) ,\\:'m B,\\TI ISI lr:B,\\ \nAt the turn of the year, \nwhen kings take the \nfield, David sent 10ab \nout with his other offi­\ncers and all the Israelite \nforce,I', and they \nravaged Ammon and \nlaül siege to Rabbah, \nwhile David remained \nin len/salern.

The key to planning such a \nstrategy is the ability to think far ahead, to imagine ways in which other \npeople can be baited into doing the job for you. \nAn essential element in making this strategy work is to disguise your \ngoal, shrouding it in mystery, like the strange enemy boats appearing \ndimly in the mist. When your rivals cannot be sure what you are after, they \nwill react in ways that often work against them in the long ron. In fact they \nwill become your cat's-paws. If you disguise your intenti ons, it is much eas­\nier to guide them into moves that accomplish exactly what you want done, \nbut prefer not to do yourself. This may require planning several moves in \nadvance, like a billiard ball that bounces off the sides a few times before \nheading into the right pocket. \nThe early-twentieth-century American con artist Yellow Kid Weil \nknew that no matter how skillfully he homed in on the perfect wealthy \nsucker, if he, a stranger, approac hed this man directly, the sucker might be­\ncome suspicious. So Weil would find someone the sucker already knew to \nserve as a cat's-pa w-s omeone lower on the totem pole who was himself \nan unlikely target, and would therefore be less suspicious. Weil would in­\nterest this man in a scheme promising incredible wealth . Conv inced the \nscheme was for real, the cat's-paw would often suggest, without prompting, \nthat his boss or wealthy friend should get invol ved: Having more cash to \ninvest, this man would increase the size of the pot, making bigger bucks for \nan concemed. The cat's-paw would then involve the wealthy sucker who \nhad been Weil's target an along, but who would not suspect a trap, since it \nwas his trosty subordinate who had roped him in. Dev ices like this are \noften the best way to approach a person of power: Use an associate or sub­\nordinate to hook you up with your primary target. The cat's-paw estab­\nlishes your cred ibility and shields you from the unsavory appearance of \nbeing too pushy in your courtship. \nThe easiest and most effe ctive way to use a cat's-paw is often to plant \ninformation with him that he will then spread to your primary target. False \nor plan ted inform ation is a power ful tool, especia lly if spread by a dupe \nwhom no one suspects. You will find it very easy to play innocent and dis­\nguise yourself as the source. \nThe strategic therapist Dr. Milton H. Erick son would often encounter \namong his patients a marrie d couple in which the wife wante d the therapy \nbut the husband absolutely refused it. Rather than wasting energy trying to \ndeal with the man directly, Dr. Erickson would see the wife alone, and as \nshe talke d he would interj ect interpretations of the husb and's behavior that \nhe knew would rile the husband up if he heard them. Sure enough, the wife \nwould tell her husband what the doctor had said. After a few weeks the \nhusband would be so furious he would insist on joining his wife in the ses­\nsions so he could set the doctor straight. \nFinally, you may well find cases in which deliberately offering yourself \nas the cat's-paw will ultimately gain you great power. This is the ruse of the \nperfect courtier. Its symbol is Sir Walter Raleigh, who once placed his own \ncloak on the muddy ground so that Queen Elizabeth would not sully her \nshoes. As the instrument that protects a master or peer from unpleasant­\nness or danger, you gain immense respect, which sooner or later will pay \ndividends. And remember: If you can make your assistance subtle and gra­\ncious rather than boastful and burdensome, your recompense will be that \nmuch the more satisfying and powerful. \nImage: The Cat's-P aw. \nIt has long claws to grab \nthings . It is soft and \npadded. Take hold of the cat \nand use its paw to pluck \nthings out of the fire, to claw \nyour enemy, to play with the \nmouse before devouring it. \nSometimes you hurt the \ncat, but most often it \ndoesn't feel a thing. \nAuthority : Do everything pie asant yourself, everything unpleas­\nant through third parties.

Let only the good come \nfrom you and the evil from others. (Baltasar Gracian, 1601-1658) \nLAW 26 213 \n214 LAW 26 REVERSAL \nThe cat's-paw and the scapegoat must be used with extreme caution and \ndelicacy. They are like screens that hide your own involvement in dirty \nwork from the public; if at any moment the screen is lifted and you are \nseen as the manipulator, the puppet master, the whole dynamic turns \naround-your hand will be seen everywhere, and you will be blamed for \nmisfort unes you may have had nothing to do with. Once the truth is re­\nvealed, events will snowball beyond your control. \nIn 1572, Queen Catherine de' Medicis of France conspired to do away \nwith Gaspard de Coligny, an admiral in the French navy and a leading \nmember of the Huguenot (French Protestant) community. Coligny was \nelose to Catheri ne's son, Charles IX, and she feared his growing influence \non the young king. So she arranged for a member of the Guise family, one \nof the most powernd royal elans in France, to assassinate hirn. \nSecretly, however, Catherine had another plan: She wanted the Hu­\nguenots to blame the Guises for killing one of their leaders, and to take re­\nvenge. With one blow, she would erase or injure two threatening rivals, \nColigny and the Guise family. Yet both plans went awry. The assassin \nmissed his target, only wounding Coligny; knowing Catherine as his \nenemy, he strongly suspected it was she who had set up the attack on hirn, \nand he told the king so. Eventually the failed assassination and the argu­\nments that ensued from it set off achain of events that led to a bloody civil \nwar between Catholics and Protestants, culminating in the harrifying Mas­\nsacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve, in which thousands of Protestants were \nkilled. \nIf you have to use a cat's-paw or a scapegoat in an action of great con­\nsequence, be very care ful: Too much can go wrong. It is often wiser to use \nsuch dupes in more innocent endeavors, where mistakes or miscalculations \nwill cause no serious harm. \nFinally, there are moments when it is advanta geous to not disguise \nyour involvement or responsibility, but rather to take the blame yourself \nfar some mistake . If you have power and are secure in it, you should some­\ntimes play the penitent: With a sorrowful look, you ask for forgiveness \nfrom those weaker than you. It is the ploy of the king who makes a show of \nhis own sacrifices far the good of the people. Similarly, upon occasion you \nmay want to appear as the agent of punishment in order to instill fear and \ntrembling in your subordinate s. Instead of the cat's-paw you show your \nown mighty hand as a threatening gesture. Play such a card sparingly. If \nyou play it too often, fear will turn into resentrnent and hatred. Before you \nknow it, such emotions will spark a vigorous opposition that will someday \nbring you down. Get in the habit of using a cat's-pa w-it is far safer. \nLAW \n27 \nPLAY ON PEOPL E'S NE ED \nTO BE LIEVE TO CR EATE A \nCUL TLIK E FO LLO WIN G \nJUDGMENT \nPeople have an overwhelming desire to believe in some­\nthing.

Having a large following opens up all sorts of \npossibilities for deception; not only will your followers worship you, they \nwill defend you from your enemies and will voluntarily take on the work of \nenticing others to join your fledgling cult. This kind of power will lift you to \nanother realm: You will no longer have to struggle or use subterfuge to en­\nforce your wilL You are adored and can do no wrong. \nYou might think it a gargan tuan task to create such a following, but in \nfact it is fairly simple. As humans, we have adesperate need to believe in \nsomething, anything. This makes us eminently gullible: We simply cannot \nendure long periods of doubt, or of the emptin ess that comes from a lack of \nsomething to believe in. Dangle in front of us some new cause, elixir, get­\nrich-quick scherne, or the latest technological trend or art movement and \nwe leap from the water as one to take the bait. Look at history: The chroni­\ndes of the new trends and cults that have made a mass following for them­\nselves could fill a library. After a few centurie s, a few decades, a few years, \na few months, they generally look ridiculous, but at the time they seem so \nattractive, so transcendental, so divine. \nAlways in a rush to believe in something, we will manufacture saints \nand faiths out of nothing. Do not let this gullibility go to waste: Make your­\nself the object of worship . Make people form a cult around you. \nThe great European charlatans of the sixteenth and seventeenth cen­\nturies mastered the art of cultmaking. They lived, as we do now, in a time \nof transformat ion: Organiz ed religion was on the wane, seience on the rise. \nPeople were desperate to rally around a new cause or faith. The charlatans \nhad begun by peddling health elixirs and alchemie shortcuts to wealth. \nMoving quickly from town to town, they originally focused on small \ngroups-until, by accident, they stumbled on a truth of human nature: \nThe larger the group they gathered around themselve s, the easier it was to \ndeceive. \nThe charlatan would station hirnself on a high wooden platform (hence \nthe term \"mountebank\") and crowds would swarm around hirn. In a group \nsetting, people were more emotional, less able to reason. Had the charlatan \nspoken to them individually, they might have found hirn ridiculous, but lost \nin a crowd they got caught up in a communal mood of rapt attention. It be­\ncame impossible for them to find the distance to be skepticaL Any defieien­\neies in the charlata n's ideas were hidden by the zeal of the mass. Passion \nand enthusiasm swept through the crowd like a contagion, and they reacted \nviolently to anyone who dared to spread a seed of doubt. Both consciously \nstudying this dynamic over decades of experiment and spontaneous ly \nadapting to these situations as they happened, the charlatans perfected the \nseience of attracting and holding a crowd, molding the crowd into followers \nand the followers into a cult. \nThe gimmicks of the charlatans may seem quaint today, but there are \nthousands of charlatans among us still, using the same tried-and-true meth­\nods their predecessors refined centuries ago, only changing the names of \ntheir elixirs and modernizing the look of their cults. We find these latter­\nday charlatans in all arenas of life-b usiness, fashion, politics, art. Many of \nthem, perhaps, are following in the charlatan tradition without having any \nknowledge of its history, but you can be more systematic and deliberate . \nSimp ly follow the five steps of cultmaking that oUf charlatan ancestors per­\nfected over the years . \nStep 1: Keep It Vague; Keep It Simple. To create a cult you must first \nattract attention. This you should do not through actions, which are too \nclear and reada ble, but through words, which are hazy and deceptive. Your \ninitial speeches, conversa tions, and interviews must include two elements : \non the one hand the promise of somet hing great and tran sformative, and \non the other a total vag ueness. This combination will stimulate all kinds of \nhazy dreams in your listeners, who will make their own connections and \nsee what they want to see. \nTo make your vaguen ess attrac tive, use words of great resonance but \ncloudy meaning, words full of heat and enth usiasm . Fancy titles for simple \nthings are helpful, as are the use of numbers and the creation of new words \nfor vague concepts. All of these create the impre ssion of specialized knowl­\nedge, giving you aveneer of profund ity. By the same token, try to make the \nsubject of YOUf cult new and fresh, so that few will understand it. Done right, \nthe combination of vague promises, cloudy but alluring concepts, and fiery \nenthu siasm will stir people's souls and a group will form around you. \nTalk too vaguely and you have no credibility. But it is more dangerous \nto be specific. If you explain in detail the benefits people will gain by fol­\nIowing your cult, you will be exp ected to satisfy them. \nAs a corollary to its vaguen ess your appeal should also be simple. \nMost people's problems have complex causes: deep-rooted neurosis, inter­\nconnected social factors, roots that go way back in time and are exceed­\ningly hard to unra vel. Few, however, have the patience to deal with this; \nmost people want to hear that a simple solution will cure their problems. \nThe ability to offer this kind of solution will give you great power and build \nyou a following. Instead of the complicated explanations of real life, return \nto the primitive solutions of our ancestors, to good old country remedies, to \nmysterious panace as. \nStep 2: Emphasize the Visual and the Sensual over the Intellectual. \nOnce people have begun to gather around you, two dangers will present \nthemselve s: boredom and skeptici sm. Boredom will make people go else­\nwhere ; skepticism will allow them the distance to think rationally about \nwhate ver it is you are offering, blowing away the mist you have artfully cre­\nated and revealing your ideas for what they are. You need to amuse the \nbored, then, and ward off the cynics. eneountered scienee \nand edueation at some \ntime, though briefly \nand unsuecessfully ... \nThe great mass of \nmankind has always \nbeen predisposed to \nmarvel at mysteries, \nand this was especially \ntrue at eertain historie \nperiods when the \nsecure foundations of \nlife seemed shaken and \nold' values, eeonomie or \nspiritual, long aceepted \nas certaintie;; eould no \nlonger be relied upon. \nThen the numbers of \nthe charlatan 's dupes \nmultiplied-the \"self \nkillers,\" as a seven­\nteenth-eentur y English­\nman called them. \nTHE POWER OF THE \nCHARL ATAN, \nGRETE DE FRANCESC O, \n1939 \nTHE O\"'L 11'110 \nWAS CO!) \nOnee upon a starless \nmidnight there was an \nowl who sat on the \nbraneh of an oak tree. \nTwo ground moles \ntried to slip quietly by, \nunnoticed. \"You!\" said \nthe owl. \"Who?\" they \nquavered, in fear and \nastonishment, for they \neould not believe it was \npossible for anyone to \nsee them in that thick \ndarkness. \"You two!\" \nsaid the owl. The moles \nhurried away and told \nthe other ereatures of \nthe jield and forest that \nthe owl was the greatest \nand wisest of all \nanimals beeause he \ncould see in the dark \nLAW 27 217 \nand beeause he eould \nanswer any question. \n''!'ll see about that,\" \nsaid a seeretary bird, \nand he called on the \nowl one night when it \nwas aga in very dark. \n\"How many claws am I \nholding up?\" said the \nsecretary bird. \"Two,\" \nsaid the owl, and that \nwas right. \"Can you \ngive me another \nexpression for 'that is \nto say' or 'namely?'\" \nasked the secretary \nbird. \"To wit,\" said the \nowl. \"Why does a lover \neall on his love?\" asked \nthe secretary bird. \"To \nwoo,\" said the owl. \nThe secretary bird \nhastened baek to the \nother creatures and \nreported that the owl \nwas indeed the greatest \nand wisest animal in \nthe world becallse he \ncould see in the dark \nand because he cOllld \nanswer any ljuestion. \n\"Can /ze sec in the \ndaytime, too?\" asked a \nred fox. \"Yes,\" echoed a \ndormouse and a \nFrench poodle. \"Can he \nsee in the daytime, \ntoo?\" All the other \ncreatures laughed \nloudly at this silly ljues­\ntion, and they set upon \nthe red fox and his \nfriends and drove them \nout ofthe region. Then \nthey sent a messen ger \nto the owl and asked \nhim to be their leader. \nWhen the owl appeared \namong the animals it \nwas high noon and the \nsun was shining \nbrightly. He walked \nvery slowly, which gave \nhim an appearance of \ngreat dignity, ami he \npeered ab out him with \nlarge, staring eye,\\; \nwhich gave him an air \n218 LAW 27 The best way to do this is through theater, or other devices of its kind, \nSurround YOUfselfwith luxury, dazzle YOUf followers with visual splendor, \nfill their eyes with spectacle. Not only will this keep them from seeing the \nridiculousness of YOUf ideas, the holes in YOUf belief system, it will also at­\ntract more attention, more followers. Appeal to all the senses: Use incense \nfor scent, soothing music for hearing, colorful charts and graphs for the \neye. You might even tickle the mind, perhaps by using new technological \ngadgets to give YOUf cult a pseudo-scientific veneer-as long as you do not \nmake anyone really think. Use the exotic-distant cultures, strange cus­\ntoms-to create theatrical effects, and to make the most banal and ordinary \naffairs seem signs of something extraordinary. \nStep 3: Borrow the Forms of Organ ized Religion to Structure the \nGroup. YOUf cultlike following is growing; it is time to organize it. Find a \nway both elevating and comforting. Organized religions have long held un­\nquestioned authority for large numbers of people, and continue to do so in \nOUf supposedly secular age. And even if the religion itself has faded some, \nits forms still resonate with power. The lofty and holy associations of orga­\nnized religion can be endlessly exploited. Create rituals for YOUf followers; \norganize them into a hierarchy, ranking them in grades of sanctity, and giv­\ning them names and titles that resound with religious overtones; ask them \nfor sacrifices that will fill YOUf coffers and increase your power. To empha­\nsize YOUf gathering's quasi-religious nature, ta1k and act like a prophet. You \nare not a dictator, after all; you are a priest, a guru, a sage, a shaman, or any \nother word that hides YOUf real power in the mist of religion. \nStep 4: Disguise Your Source of Income. YOUf group has grown, and you \nhave structured it in a chUfchHke form. YoUf coffers are beginning to fill \nwith your followers' money. Yet you must never be seen as hungry for \nmoney and the power it brings. It is at this moment that you must disguise \nthe SOUfce of your income. \nYour followers want to believe that if they follow you all sorts of good \nthings will fall into their lap. By surrounding YOUfself with luxury you be­\ncome living proof of the soundness of YOUf belief system. Never reveal that \nyour wealth actually comes from your followers' pockets; instead, make it \nseem to come from the truth of YOUf methods. Followers will copy YOUf \neach and every move in the belief that it will bring them the same results, \nand their imitative enthusiasm will blind them to the charlatan nature of \nYOUf wealth. \nStep 5: Set Up an Us-V ersus- Them Dynamic. The group is now large \nand thriving, a magnet attracting more and more particles. If you are not \ncareful, though, inertia will set in, and time and boredom will demagnetize \nthe group. To keep YOUf followers united, you must now do what all reli­\ngions and belief systems have done: create an us-versus-them dynamic. \nFirst, make sure YOUf followers believe they are part of an exclusive \nclub, unified by a bond of common goals. Then, to strengthen this bond, \nmanufacture the notion of a devious enemy out to ruin you. There is a \nforce of nonbelievers that will do anything to stop you. Any outsider who \ntries to reveal the charlatan nature of your belief system can now be de­\nscribed as a member of this devious force. \nIf you have no enemies, invent one. Given a straw man to react \nagainst, your followers will tighten and cohere. They have your cause to \nbelieve in and infidels to destroy. \nOBSER VANCES OF THE LAW \nObservance I \nIn the year 1653, a twenty -seven-year-old Milan man named Francesco \nGiuseppe Borri claimed to have had a vision. He went around town telling \none and all that the archangel Michael had appeared to hirn and an­\nnounced that he had been chosen to be the capitano generale of the Army \nof the New Pope, an army that would seize and revitalize the world. \nThe archangel had further revealed that Borri now had the power to see \npeople's souls, and that he would so on discover the philosopher's stone-a \nlong-sought-after substance that could change base metals into gold. \nFriends and acquainta nces who heard Borri explain the vision, and who \nwitnessed the change that had come over hirn, were impressed, for Borri \nhad previously devoted hirnself to a life of wine, women, and gambling. \nNow he gave all that up, plunging hirnself into the study of alchemy and \ntalking only of mysticism and the occult. \nThe transformation was so sudden and miracu lous, and Borri's words \nwere so filled with enthusiasm, that he began to create a following. Unfor­\ntunately the Italian Inquisition began to notice hirn as well-they pro se­\ncuted anyone who delved into the occult-so he left Italy and began to \nwander Europe, from Austria to Holland, telling one and all that \"to those \nwho follow me all joy shall be grahted.\" Wherever Borri stayed he at­\ntracted followers. His method was simple : He spoke of his vision, which \nhad grown more and more elaborate , and offered to \"look into\" the soul of \nanyone who believed hirn (and they were many). Seemingly in a trance, he \nwould stare at this new follower for several minutes, then claim to have \nseen the person's soul, degree of enlightenment, and potential for spiritual \ngreatness. If what he saw showed promise, he would add the person to his \ngrowing order of disciple s, an honor indeed. \nThe cult had six degre es, into which the disciples were assigned ac­\ncording to what Borri had glimpsed in their souls. With work and total de­\nvotion to the cult they could graduate to a higher degree. Borri-whom \nthey called \"His Excellency ,\" and \"Universal Doctor\"-demanded from \nthem the strictest vows of poverty. All the goods and moneys they pos­\nsessed had to be tumed over to hirn.

He would drive through the city in a coach \nstudded with jewels, with six magnificent black horses at its head. He never \nstayed too long in one place, and when he disappeared, saying he had \nmore souls to gather into his flock, his reputation only grew in his absence. \nHe became famous, although in fact he had never done a single concrete \nthing. \nFrom all over Europe, the blind, the crippled, and the desperate came \nto visit Borri, for word had spread that he had healing powers. He asked no \nfee for his services, which only made hirn seem more marvelous, and in­\ndeed some claimed that in this or that city he had performed a miracle \neure. By only hinting at his accomplishments, he encouraged people's \nimaginati ons to blow them up to fantastic proportions. His wealth, for ex­\nample, actually came from the vast sums he was collecting from his in­\ncreasingly select group of rich disciples; yet it was presumed that he had in \nfact perfected the philosopher's stone. The Church continued to pursue \nhirn, denouncing hirn for heresy and witchcraft, and Borri's response to \nthese charges was a dignified silence; this only enha nced his reputation and \nmade his followers more passionate . Only the great are persecuted, after \nall; how many understood Jesus Christ in his own time? Borri did not have \nto say a word-his followers now called the Pope the Antichrist. \nAnd so Borri's power grew and grew, until one day he left the city of \nAmsterdam (where he had settled for a while), absconding with huge sums \nof bOITowed money and diamonds that had been entrusted to hirn. (He \nclaimed to be able to remove the flaws from diamonds through the power \nof his gifted mind.) Now he was on the run. The Inquisition eventually \ncaught up with him, and for the last twenty years of his life he was impris­\noned in Rome. But so great was the belief in his occult powers that to his \ndying day he was visited by wealthy believers , including Queen Christina \nof Sweden. Supplying hirn with money and materials, these visitors al­\nlowed hirn to continue his search for the elusive philosopher's stone. \nInterpretation \nBefore he formed his cult, Borri seems to have stumbled on a critical dis­\ncovery. Tiring of his life of debauchery, he had decided to give it up and to \ndevote hirnself to the occult, a genuine int erest of his. He must have no­\nticed, however, that when he alluded to a mystical experience (rather than \nphysical exhaustion) as the source of his conversion, people of all classes \nwanted to hear more. Realizing the power he could gain by ascribing the \nchange to something external and mysterious, he went further with his \nmanufactured visions. The grander the vision, and the more sacrifices he \nasked for, the more appealing and believable his story seemed to become. \nRememb er: People are not interested in the truth about change. They \ndo not want to hear that it has come from hard work, or from anything as \nbanal as exhaustion, bore dom, or depression; they are dying to believe in \nsornething romantic, otherworldly. They want to hear of angels and out-of­\nbody experiences. Indulge them. Hint at the mystical source of some per­\nsonal change, wrap it in ethereal colors, and a cultlike following will form \naround you. Adapt to people's needs: The messiah must mirror the desires \nofhis followers. And always aim high. The bigger and bolder your illusion, \nthe better. \nObservance 11 \nIn the mid-1700s, word spread in Europe's fashionable society of a Swiss \neountry doctor named Michael Schüppach who practiced a different kind \nof rnedicine: He used the healing powers of nature to perform miraculous \neures. Soon well-to-do people from all over the Continent, their ailments \nboth serious and mild, were making the trek to the alpine village of Lang­\nnau, where Schüppach lived and worked. Trudging through the mountain s, \nthese visitors witnessed the most dramatic naturallandscapes that Europe \nhas to offer. By the time they reached Langnau, they were already feeling \ntransformed and on their way to health. \nSchüppach, who had become known as simply the \"Mountain Doc­\ntor,\" had a small pharmacy in town. This place became quite a scene: \nCrowds of people from many different countries would cram the small \nroorn, its walls lined with colorful bottles filled with herbal eures. Where \nmost doctors of the time prescribed foul-tasting concoctions that bore in­\ncornprehensible Latin titles (as medicines often do still), Schüppach's eures \nhad names such as \"The Oil of Joy,\" \"Little Flower's Heart,\" or ''Against \nthe Monster,\" and they tasted sweet and pleasing. \nVisitors to Langnau would have to wait patiently for a visit with the \nMountain Doctor, because every day some eighty messengers would arrive \nat the pharmacy bearing flasks of urine from all over Europe. Schüppach \nclaimed he could diagnose what ailed you simply by looking at a sampie of \nyour urine and reading a written description of your ailment. (Naturally he \nread the description very carefully before prescribing a eure.) When he fi­\nnally had a spare minute (the urine sampies took up much of his time), he \nwould call the visitor into his office in the pharmacy. He would then exam­\nine this person's urine sampie, explaining that its appearance would tell \nhirn everything he needed to know. Country people had a sense for these \nthings, he would say-their wisdom came from living a simple, godly life \nwith none of the complicat ions of urban living. This personal consultation \nwould also include a discussion as to how one might bring one's soul more \ninto harmony with nature. \nSchüppach had devised many forms of treatment, each profoundly un­\nlike the usual medical practices of the time. He was a believer, for instance, \nin electric shock therapy. To those who wondered whether this was in \nkeeping with his belief in the healing power of nature, he would explain \nthat electricity is a natural phenomenon; he was merely imitating the the fabulous establish­\nment he opened in \nLondon for the sale of \nhis elixirs .... In the \nchief room. where he \nreceived patient s, stood \n\"the largest air pump \nin the world\" 10 assist \nhim in his \"philosophi­\ncal investigation s\" into \ndisease, ami also a \n\"stupendous metallic \nconductor, \" a richly \ngilded pedestal \nsurrounded with retorts \nand vials of \"etherial \nand other essences. \" \n...

One of his patients claimed to be inhabited by seven \ndevils. The doctor cured hirn with electrical shocks, and as he administered \nthese he exclaimed that he could see the devils flying out of the man's \nbody, one by one. Another man claimed to have swallowed a hay wagon \nand its driver, whieh were causing hirn massive pains in the ehest. The \nMountain Doctor listened patiently, claimed to be able to hear the crack of \na whip in the man's belly, promised to eure hirn, and gave hirn asedative \nand a purgative. The man fell asleep on a ehair outside the pharmacy. As \nso on as he awoke he vomited, and as he vomited a hay wagon sped past \nhirn (the Mountain Doctor had hired it for the occasion), the crack of its \nwhip making hirn feel that somehow he had indeed expelled it under the \ndoctor's care. \nOver the years, the Mountain Doctor's farne grew. He was consulted \nby the powerful-even the writer Goethe made the trek to his village-and \nhe becarne the center of a cult of nature in whieh everything natural was \nconsidered worthy of worship . Sehüppaeh was careful to create effects that \nwould entertain and inspire his patients. A professor who visited hirn once \nwrote, \"One stands or sits in company, one plays cards, sometimes with a \nyoung woman; now a concert is given, now a luneh or supper, and now a \nlittle ballet is presented. With a very happy effect, the freedom of nature is \neverywhere united with the pleasures of the beau monde, and if the doctor \nis not able to heal any diseases, he can at least eure hypoehondria and the \nvapors.\" \nInterpretation \nSchüppach had begun his career as an ordinary village doctor. He would \nsometimes use in his practice some of the village remedies he had grown \nup with, and apparently he noticed some results, for soon these herbal tinc­\ntures and natural forms ofhealing became his specialty. And in fact his nat­\nural form of healing did have profound psyehological effects on his \npatients. Where the normal drugs of the time created fear and pain, Schüp­\npach's treatments were comfortable and soothing. The resulting improve­\nment in the patient's mood was a critical element in the eures he brou ght \nabout. His patients believed so deeply in his skills that they willed them­\nselves into health. Instead of scoffing at their irrational explanations for \ntheir ailments, Schüppach used their hypochondria to make it seem that he \nhad effected a great eure . \nThe caseof the Mountain Doctor teaches us valuable lessons in the \ncreation of a cultlike following. First, you must find a way to engage peo­\nple's will, to make their belief in your powers strong enough that they \nimagine all sorts of benefits. Their belief will have a self-fulfilling quality, \nbut you must make sure that it is you, rather than their own will, who is \nseen as the agent of transformati on. Find the belief, cause, or fantasy that \nwill make them believe with a passion and they will imagine the rest, wor­\nshipping you as healer, prophet, genius, whatever you like. \nSecond, Schüppach teaches us the everlasting power of belief in na­\nture, and in simplic ity. Nature, in reality, is full of much that is terrifying­\npoisonous plants, fierce animal s, sudden disasters, plagues. Belief in the \nhealing, comforting quality of nature is really a constructed myth, a roman­\nticism. But the appeal to nature can bring you great power, especia lly in \ncornplicated and stressful times. \nThis appeal, however, must be handled right. Devise a kind of theater \nof nature in which you, as the director, pick and choose the qualities that fit \nthe romanticism of the times. The Mountain Doctor played the part to per­\nfection, playing up his homespun wisdom and wit, and staging his eures as \ndrarnatic pieces. He did not make hirnself one with nature; instead he \nmolded nature into a cult, an artificial construction. To create a \"natural\" \neffect you actually have to work hard, making nature theatrical and de­\nlightfully pagan. Otherwise no one will notice. Nature too must follow \ntrends and be progressive. \nObservance 111 \nIn 1788, at the age of fifty-five, the doctor and scientist Franz Mesmer was \nat a crossroads. He was a pioneer in the study of animal magnetism-the \nbelief that animals contain magnetic matter, and that a doctor or specialist \ncan effect miraculous eures by working on this charged substance-but in \nVienna, where he lived, his theories had met with scom and ridicule from \nthe medical establishment. In treating women for convulsions, Mesmer \nclairned to have worked a number of eures, his proudest achievement \nbeing the restoration of sight to a blind girl. But another doctor who exam­\nined the young girl said she was as blind as ever, an assessment with which \nshe herself agreed. Mesmer countered that his enemies were out to slander \nhirn by winning her over to their side. This claim only elicited more \nridicule. Clearly the sober-minded Viennese were the wrong audience for \nhis theories, and so he decided to move to Paris and start again. \nRenting a splendid apartment in his new city, Mesmer decorated it ap­\npropriately. Stained glass in most of the windows created a religious feel­\ning, and mirrors on all the walls produced an hypnotic effect. The doctor \nadvertised that in his apartment he would give demonstrations of the pow­\ners of animal magnetism, inviting the diseased and melancholie to fee! its \npowers. Soon Parisians of all classes (but mostly women, who seemed more \nattracted to the idea than men did) were paying for entry to witness the \nmiracles that Mesmer promised. \nInside the apartm ent, the scents of orange blossom and exotic incense \nwafted through special vents. As the initiates filtered into the salon where \nthe demon strations took place, they heard harp music and the lulling \nsounds of a female vocalist coming from another room. In the center of the \nsalon was a long oval container filled with water that Mesmer claimed had \nbeen magnetiz ed. From holes in the container's metallid protruded long \nmovable iron rods. The visitors were instructed to sit around the container, \nplace these magnetized rods on the body part that gave them pains or \nproblems, and then hold hands with their neighb ors, sitting as close as pos­\nsible to one another to help the magnetic force pass between their bodies. \nSometim es, too, they were attached to each other by cords. \nMesmer would leave the room, and \"assistant magnet izers\"-all hand-T//L I'()\\ \\ /,:11 <H ,\\ I.W \nIn the town of \nTarnopollived a man \nby Ihe name of Reb \nFeivel. One day, as he \nsat in his house deeply \nabsorbed in his \nTalmud, he heard a \nloud noise outside, \nWhen he went 10 the \nwindow he saw a lot of \nfittle pranksters, \"Up to \nsame new piece of \nmischief: no doubt,\" he \nthoughl, \n\"Children, run quiekly \n10 the synagogue, \" he \neried, leaning out and \nimprovising the first \nslory that occurred to \nhim, \"You '11 see there a \nsea monster, and what a \nmonsler!

And what did \nhe see? A great crowd \nof men, women and \nchildren, all running \ntoward the synagogue. \n\"What's up?\" he cried, \nsticking his head out of \nthe window. \n\"What a question! \nWhy, don't you know?\" \nthey answered. \"Right \nin front of the syna­\ngogue there:, a sea \nmonster. It's a creature \nwith jive legs, three \neyes, and a beard like \nthat of a goat, only \nit's green!\" \nAnd as the crowd \nhurried by, Reb Feivel \nsuddenly noticed that \nthe rabbi himself was \namong them. \n\"Lord ofthe world!\" \nhe exclaimed. \"Ifthe \nrabbi himself is \nrunning with them \nsurely there must be \nsomething happening. \nWhere there's smoke \nthere's jire!\" \nWithout further \nthought Reb Feivel \ngrabbed his hat, left his \nhouse, and also \nbegan running. \n\"Who can tell?\" he \nmuttered to himself as \nhe ran, all out of \nbreath, toward the \nsynagogue. \nA TREASURY OF \nJEWISH FOLKLORE, \nNATHAN AUSUBEL, EU., \n1948 \n224 LAW 27 some and strapping young men-would enter with jars of magnetized \nwater that they would sprinkle on the patients, rubbing the healing fluid on \ntheir bodies, massaging it into their skin, moving them toward a trancelike \nstate. And after a few minutes a kind of delirium would overcome the \nwomen. Some would sob, some would shriek and tear their hair, others \nwould laugh hysterically_ At the height of the delirium Mesmer would \nreenter the salon, dressed in a flowing silk robe embroidered with golden \nflowers and carrying a white magnetic rod. Moving around the container, \nhe would stroke and soothe the patients until calm was restored. Many \nwomen would later attribute the strange power he had on them to his \npiercing look, which, they thought, was exciting or quieting the magnetic \nfluids in their bodies. \nWithin months of his arrival in Paris, Mesmer became the rage. His \nsupporters included Marie-Antoinette herself, the queen of France, wife of \nLouis XVL As in Vienna, he was condemned by the official faculty of med­\nicine, but it did not matter. His growing following of pupils and patients \npaid hirn handsome ly_ \nMesmer expanded his theories to proclaim that all humanity could be \nbrought into harmony through the power of magnetism, a concept with \nmuch appeal during the French Revolution. A cult of Mesmerism spread \nacross the country; in many towns, \"Societies of Harmony\" sprang up to \nexperiment with magnetism. These societies eventually became notorious : \nThey tended to be led by libertines who would turn their sessions into a \nkind of group orgy. \nAt the height of Mesmer's popularity, a French commission published \nareport based on years of testing the theory of animal magnetism. The \nconclusion : Magnetism's effects on the body actually came from a kind of \ngroup hysteria and autosugge stion. The report was well documented, and \nruined Mesmer's reputation in France. He left the country and went into \nretirement. Only a few years later, however, imitators sprang up all over \nEurope and the cult of Mesmerism spread once again, its believers more \nnumerous than ever. \nInterpretation \nMesmer's career can be broken into two parts. When still in Vienna, he \nclearly believed in the validity of his theory, and did all he could to prove \nit. But his growing frustration and the disapproval of his colleagues made \nhirn adopt another strategy. First he moved to Paris, where no one knew \nhim, and where his extravagant theories found a more fruitful soH. Then he \nappealed to the French love of theater and spectacle, making his apartment \ninto a kind of magical world in which a sensory overload of smells, sights, \nand sounds entranced his customers. Most irnportant, from now on he \npracticed his magnetism only on a group_ The group provided the setting \nin which the magnetism would have its proper effect, one believer infecting \nthe other, overwhelming any individual doubter. \nMesmer thus passed from being a confirmed advocate of magnetism \nto the role of a charlatan using every trick in the book to captivate the pub-\nHe. The biggest trick of all was to play on the repressed sexuality that bub­\nbles under the surface of any group setting. In a group, a longing for social \nunity, a longing older than civilization, cries out to be awakened. This de­\nsire rnay be subsumed under a unifying cause, but beneath it is a repressed \nsexuality that the charlatan knows how to exploit and manipulate for his \nown purposes. \nThis is the lesson that Mesmer teaches us: Our tendency to doubt, the \ndistance that allows us to reason, is broken down when we join a group. \nThe warmth and inf ectiousness of the group overwh elm the skeptical indi­\nvidual. This is the power you gain by creating a cult. Also, by playing on \npeople's repressed sexuality, you lead them into mistaking their excited \nfeelings for signs of your mystical strength. You gain untold power by \nworking on people's unrealized desire for a kind of promiscuous and \npagan unity. \nRemember too that the most effective cuIts mix religion with science. \nTake the latest technological trend or fad and blend it with a noble cause, a \nmystical faith, a new form of healing. People's interpretat ions of your hy­\nbrid cuIt will run rampant, and they will attribute powers to you that you \nhad never even thought to claim. \nImage: The Magnet. An unseen force draws objects to it, \nwhieh in turn become magnetized themselves, drawing other \npieees to them, the magnetie power of tlle whole constantly \nincreasing. But take away the original magnet and it all falls \napart. Become the magnet, the invisible farce that attracts \npeople's imaginat ions and holds them together. Onee they \nhave clustered around you, no power can wrest them away. \nAuthority: The eharlatan achieves his great power by simply opening \na possibility far men to believe what they already want to believe .... \nThe eredulous eannot keep at a distance; they erowd around the \nwonder worker, entering his personal aura, surrendering themselves \nto illusion with a heavy solemnity, like cattle. (Grete de Francesco) \nLAW 27 225 \n226 LAW 27 REVERSAL \nOne reason to create a following is that a group is often easier to deceive \nthan an individual, and turns over to you that much more power. This \ncomes, however, with a danger: If at any moment the group sees through \nyou, you will find yourself facing not one deceived soul but an angry crowd \nthat will tear you to pieces as avidly as it once followed you. The charlatans \nconstantly faced this danger, and were always ready to move out of town as \nit inevitably became clear that their elixirs did not work and their ideas \nwere sham. Too slow and they paid with their lives. In playing with the \ncrowd, you are playing with fire, and must constantly keep an eye out far \nany sparks of doubt, any enemies who will turn the crowd against you. \nWhen you play with the emotions of a crowd, you have to know how to \nadapt, attuning yourself instantan eously to all of the moods and desires that \na group will produce. Use spies, be on top of everything, and keep yOUf \nbags packed. \nFor this reason you may often prefer to deal with people one by one. \nIsolating them from their normal milieu can have the same effect as putting \nthem in a group--it makes them more prone to suggestion and intimida­\ntion. Choose the right sucker and if he eventually sees through you he may \nprove easier to escape than a crowd. \nLAW \n28 \nENTER ACT ION \nWITH BO LDN ESS \nJUDGMENT \nIf you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. \nYour doubts and hesitations will infect your execution. \nTimidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness.

Everything depends on percep­\ntion, and once you are seen as the kind of person who quickly goes on the \ndefensive, who is willing to negotiate and be amenable, you will be pushed \naround without mercy. \nBoldness Strikes Fear; Fear Creates Autho rity. The bald move makes \nyou seem larger and more powerful than you are. If it comes suddenly, \nwith the stealth and swift ness of a snake, it inspires that much more fear. By \nintimidating with a bald move, you esta bHsh a precedent: in every sub se­\nquent encounter, people will be on the defensi ve, in terror of your next \nstrike. \nGoing Halfway with Half a Heart Digs the Deeper Grave. If you \nenter an action with less than total confidence, you set up obstacles in your \nown path. Wh en a problem arises you will grow confused, seeing options \nwhere there are none and inadvertently creating more problems still. Re­\ntreating from the hunter, the timid hare scurries more easily into his snares. \nHesitat ion Creates Gaps, Boldness Obliterates Them. Wh en you take \ntime to think, to hem and haw, you create a gap that allows others time to \nthink as weH. Your timidity infects people with awkwar d energy, elicits em­\nbarrassment. Doubt springs up on all sides. \nBoldness destroys such gap s. The swift ness of the move and the energy \nof the action leave others no space to doubt and worry. In seduction, hesi­\ntation is fatal-it makes your victim conscious of your intent ions. The bald \nmove crowns seduction with triump h: It leaves no time for reflect ion. \nAudacity Sepa rates You from the Herd. Boldness gives you presence \nand makes you seem larger than life. The timid fade into the wallp aper, the \nbold draw attention, and what draws attention draws power. We cannot \nkeep our eyes off the audacious-we cannot wait to see their next bold \nmove. \nOBSERVANCES OF THE LAW \nObservance I \nIn May of 1925, five of the most successful dealers in the French scrap­\nmetal business found themselves invited to an \"official\" but \"highly confi­\ndential\" meeting with the deputy director general of the Ministry of Post \nand Telegraphs at the Hotel Crillon, then the most luxurious hotel in Paris. \nWhen the businessmen arrived, it was the director general himself, a Mon­\nsieur Lustig, who met them in a swank suite on the top floor. \nThe businessmen had no idea why they had been summoned to this \nmeeting, and they were bursting with curiosity. Mter drinks, the director \nexplained. \"Gentlemen,\" he said, \"this is an urgent matter that requires \ncomplete secrecy. The government is going to have to tear down the Eiffel \nTower.\" The dealers listened in stunned silence as the director explained \nthat the tower, as recently reported in the news, desperately needed re­\npairs. It had originally been meant as a temporary structure (for the Expo­\nsition of 1889), its maintenance costs had soared over the years, and now, \nin a time of a fiscal crisis, the government would have to spend millions to \nfix it. Many Parisians considered the Eiffel Tower an eyesore and would be \ndelighted to see it go. Over time, even the tourists would forget about it-it \nwould live on in photographs and postcards. \"Gentlemen,\" Lustig said, \n\"you are all invited to make the government an offer for the Eiffel Tower.\" \nHe gave the businessmen sheets of government stationery filled with \nfigures, such as the tonnage of the tower's metal. Their eyes popped as they \ncalculated how much they could make from the scrap. Then Lustig led \nthem to a waiting limo, which brought them to the Eiffel Tower. Flashing \nan official badge, he guided them through the area, spicing his tour with \namusing anecdotes. At the end of the visit he thanked them and asked \nthem to have their offers delivered to his suite within four days. \nSeveral days after the offers were submitted, one of the five, a Mon­\nsieur P., received notice that his bid was the winner, and that to secure the \nsale he should come to the suite at the hotel within two days, bearing a cer­\ntified check for more than 250,000 francs (the equivalent today of about \n$1,OOO,OOO)-a quarter of the total price. On delivery of the check, he \nwould receive the documents confirming his ownership of the Eiffel Tower. \nMonsieur P. was excited-he would go down in history as the man who \nhad bought and tom down the infamous landmark. But by the time he ar­\nrived at the suite, check in hand, he was beginning to have doubts about \nthe whole affair. Why meet in a hotel instead of a government building? \nWhy hadn't he heard from other officials? Was this a hoax, ascam? As he \nlistened to Lustig discuss the arrangements for the scrapping of the tower, \nhe hesitated, and contemplated backing out. be the dwarf figure of \nan elephant. fit only to \nbe placed on the top of \na stick; and then what \nhonor would there be \nin such an adventure? \n\"There is,\" said he. \n\"some deeeption in this \nwriting. It is an enigma \nonly fit to amuse a \nchi/d. I shall therefore \nleave you and your \nelephant.\" \nThe reasoner then \ndeparted; but the \nadventurous man \nrushed with his eyes \nclosed across the water; \nneither depth nor \nviolence prevented \nhirn, and according to \nthe inscri ption he saw \nthe elephant lying on \nthe opposite bank. \nHe took it and carried \nit to the top of the hili, \nwhere he saw a town. A \nshriek from the \nelephant alarmed the \npeople ofthe city, who \nrose in arms; but the \nadventurer, nothing \ndaunted. was deter­\nmined to die a hero. \nThe people, however , \nwere awed by his pres­\nence, and he was aston­\nished 10 hear them \nproclaim hirn sueeessor \nto their king, who had \nreeently died. \nGreat enterprises are \nonly aehieved by \nadventurolls .\\pirits. \nThey who ealculate \nwith 100 great nieety \nevery difficlllty and \nobstacle wh ich is likely \nto lie in their way, lose \nthat time in hesitation, \nwhich the more da ring \nseize and ren der avai/­\nable to the loftiest \np\"rposes. \nFABLES, \nJEAN DE LA FONTAINE, \n1621-16 95 \nLAW 28 229 \nAlways set to work \nwithout misgivings on \nthe score of impru­\nden ce.

Arriv-\ning in the heart of the \n230 LAW 28 Suddenly, however, he realized that the director had changed his tone. \nInstead of talking about the tower, he was complaining about his low \nsalary, about his wife's desire for a fur coat, about how galling it was to \nwork hard and be unapprecia ted. It dawned on Monsieur P. that this high \ngovernment official was asking for abribe. The effect on hirn, though, was \nnot outrage but relief. Now he was sure that Lustig was for real, since in all \nof his previous encounters with French bureaucrats, they had inevitably \nasked for a litde greasing of the palm. His confidence restored, Monsieur P. \nslipped the director several thousand francs in bills, then handed hirn the \ncertified check. In return he received the documentation, including an im­\npressive-Iooking bill of sale. He left the hotel, dreaming of the profits and \nfarne to come. \nOver the next few days, however, as Monsieur P. waited for corre­\nspondence from the government, he began to realize that something was \namiss. A few telephone calls made it clear that there was no deputy direc­\ntor general Lustig, and there were no plans to destroy the Eiffel Tower: He \nhad been bilked of over 250,000 francs! \nMonsieur P. never went to the police. He knew what kind of reputa­\ntion he would get if word got out that he had fallen for one of the most ab­\nsurdly audacious cons in history. Besides the public humiliation, it would \nhave been business suicide . \nInterpretation \nHad Count Victor Lustig, con artist extraordinaire, tried to sell the Arc de \nTriomphe, a bridge over the Seine, astatue of Balzac, no one would have \nbelieved him. But the Eiffel Tower was just too large, to� improbable to be \npart of a con job. In fact it was so improbable that Lustig was able to return \nto Paris six months later and \"resell\" the Eiffel Tower to a different scrap­\niron dealer, and for a higher price-a sum in francs equivalent today to \nover $1,500,000! \nLargen ess of scale deceives the human eye. It distracts and awes us, \nand is so self-evident that we cannot imagine there is any illusion or decep­\ntion afoot. Arm yourself with bigness and boldness -stretch your decep­\ntions as far as they will go and then go further. If you sense that the sucker \nhas suspicions, do as the intrepid Lustig did: Instead of backing down, or \nlowering his price, he simply raised his price higher, by asking for and get­\nting abribe. Asking for more puts the other person on the defensive, cuts \nout the nibbling effect of compromise and doubt, and overwhelms with its \nboldness. \nObservance II \nOn his deathbed in 1533, Vasily III, the Grand Duke of Moscow and ruler \nof a semi-united Russia, proclaimed his three-year-old son, Ivan IV, as his \nsuccessor. He appointed his young wife, Helena, as regent until Ivan \nreached his majority and could rule on his own. The aristocra cy-the bo­\nyars-secredy rejoiced: For years the dukes of Moscow had been trying to \nextend their authority over the boyars' turf. With Vasily dead, his heir a \nmere three years old, and a young woman in charge of the dukedom, the \nboyars would be able to roll back the dukes' gains, wrest control of the \nstate, and humiliate the royal family. \nAware of these dangers, young Helena tumed to her trusted friend \nPrince Ivan Obolensky to help her rule. But after five years as regent she \nsuddenly died-poisoned by a member of the Shuisky family, the most \nfearsome boyar clan. The Shuisky princes seized control of the govem­\nment and threw Obolensky in prison, where he starved to death. At the age \nof eight, Ivan was now a despised orphan, and any boyar or family mem­\nber who took an interest in hirn was immediately banished or killed. \nAnd so Ivan roamed the palace, hungry, ill clothed, and often in hid­\ning from the Shuiskys, who treated hirn roughly when they saw hirn. On \nsome days they would search hirn out, clothe hirn in royal robes, hand him \na scepter, and set hirn on the throne-a kind of mock ritual in which they \nlampooned his royal pretensions. Then they would shoo hirn away. One \nevening several of them chased the Metropolitan-the head of the Russian \nchurch-t hrough the palace, and he sought refuge in Ivan's room; the boy \nwatched in horror as the Shuiskys entered, hurled insults, and beat the \nMetropolitan mercilessl y. \nIvan had one friend in the palace, a boyar named Vorontsov who con­\nsoled and advised hirn. One day, however, as he, Vorontsov, and the \nnewest Metropolitan conferred in the palace refectory, several Shuiskys \nburst in, beat up Vorontsov, and insulted the Metropolitan by tearing and \ntreading on his robes. Then they banished Vorontsov from Moscow. \nThroughout all this Ivan maintain ed a strict silence. To the boyars it \nseemed that their plan had worked: The young man had tumed into a ter­\nrified and obedient idiot. They could ignore hirn now, even leave hirn \nalone. But on the evening of December 29, 1543, Ivan, now thirteen, asked \nPrince Andrei Shuisky to come to his room. When the prince arrived, the \nroom was filled with palace guards. Young Ivan then pointed his finger at \nAndrei and ordered the guards to arrest hirn, have hirn killed, and throw \nhis body to the bloodhounds in the royal kennel. Over the next few days \nIvan had all of Andrei's close associates arrested and banished. Caught off­\nguard by his sudden boldness, the boyars now stood in mortal terror of this \nyouth, the future Ivan the Terrible, who had planned and waited for five \nyears to execute this one swift and bold act that would secure his power for \ndecades to come. \nInterpretat ion \nThe world is full of boyars-men who despise you, fear your ambition, and \njealously guard their shrinking realms of power. You need to establish your \nauthority and gain respect, but the moment the boyars sense your growing \nboldness, they will act to thwart you. This is how Ivan met such a situation: \nHe lay low, showing neither ambition nor discontent. He waited, and when \nthe time came he brought the palace guards over to his side. The guards \nhad come to hate the cruel Shuiskys. Once they agreed to Ivan's plan, he \nstruck with the swiftness of a snake, pointing his finger at Shuisky and giv­\ning hirn no time to react. \nNegotiate with a boyar and you create opportunities for hirn. A small city, he stopped a pass­\ning gentleman. \"Hello, \nmy friend! Who is the \nrichest man in town?\" \n\"Poor countryman! \nDon 't you know Byan­\nssi, the millionaire?

He had ambitions of greatness \nas a writer, to enflame the world with his name, but how could a mere \nlackey hope to realize such dreams? \nThat year Pope Leo X received from the king of Portugal an embassy \nthat included many gifts, most prominent among them a great elephant, \nthe first in Rome since imperial times. The pontiff adored this elephant and \nshowered it with attention and gifts. But despite his love and care, the ele­\nphant, which was called Hanno, became deathly ill. The pope summoned \ndoctors, who administered a five-hundred-pound purgative to the ele­\nphant, but all to no avail. The animal died and the pope went into moum­\ning, To console hirnself he summoned the great painter Raphael and \nordered hirn to create a life-sized painting of Hanno above the animal's \ntomb, bearing the inscription, \"What nature took away, Raphael has with \nhis art restored.\" \nOver the next few days, a pamphlet circulated throughout Rome that \ncaused great merriment and laughter. Entitled \"The Last Will and Testa­\nment of the Elephant Hanno,\" it read, in part, \"To my heir the Cardinal \nSanta Croce, I give my knees, so that he can imitate my genufle ctions ... , \nTo my heir Cardinal Santi Quattro, I give my jaws, so that he can more \nreadily devour all of Christ's revenues .... To my heir Cardinal Medici, I \ngive my ears, so that he can hear everyone 's doings ... ,\" To Cardinal \nGrassi, who had areputation for lechery, the elephant bequeathed the ap­\npropriate, oversized part of his own anatomy. \nOn and on the anonymous pamphlet went, sparing none of the great \nin Rome, not even the pope. With each one it took aim at their best-known \nweakness. The pamphlet ended with verse, \"See to it that Aretino is your \nfriend / For he is a bad enemy to have. / His words alone could ruin the \nhigh pope / So God guard everyone from his tongue.\" \nInterpret ation \nWith one short pamphlet, Aretino, son of a poor shoemaker and a servant \nhirnself, hurled hirns elf to farne. Everyone in Rome rushed to find out who \nthis daring young man was. Even the pope, amused by his audacity, sought \nhirn out and ended up giving hirn a job in the papal service. Over the years \nhe came to be known as the \"Scourge of Princes,\" and his biting tongue \nearned him the respect and fear of the great, from the king of Fran ce to the \nHapsburg emperor. \nThe Aretino strategy is simple: When you are as small and obscure as \nDavid was, you must find a Goliath to attack The larger the target, the \nmore attention you gain. The bolder the attack, the more you stand out \nfrom the crowd, and the more admirat ion you earn. Society is full of those \nwho think daring thoughts but lack the guts to print and publicize them. \nVoice what the public feels-the expression of shared feelings is always \npowerful. Search out the most prominent target possible and sling yoUf \nboldest shot. The world will enjoy the spectacle , and will honor the under­\ndog-y ou, that is-with glory and power. \nKEYS TO POWER \nMost of us are timid. We want to avoid tension and conflict and we want to \nbe liked by all. We may contemplate a bold action but we rarely bring it to \nlife. We are terrified of the consequences, of what others might think of us, \nof the hostility we will stir up if we dare go beyond OUf usual place. \nAlthough we may disguise OUf timidity as a concern for others, a de­\nsire not to hurt or offend them, in fact it is the opposite-we are really self­\nabsorbed, worried about oUfselves and how others perceive uso Boldness, \non the other hand, is outer-directed, and often makes people feel more at \nease, since it is less self-conscious and less repressed. \nThis can be seen most clearly in seduction. All great seducers succeed \nthrough effrontery. Casanova' s boldness was not revealed in a daring ap­\nproach to the woman he desired, or in intrepid words to flatter her; it con­\nsisted in his ability to surrender himself to her completely and to make her \nbelieve he would do anything for her, even risk his life, which in fact he \nsometimes did. The woman on whom he lavished this attention under­\nstood that he held nothing back from her. This was infinitely more flatter­\ning than compliments. At no point during the seduction would he show \nhesitation or doubt, simply because he never feIt it. \nPart of the charm of being seduced is that it makes us feel engulfed, \ntemporarily outside of oUfselves and the usual doubts that permeate our \nJives. The moment the seducer hesitate s, the charm is broken, because we \nbecome aware of the process, of their deliberate effort to seduce us, of \ntheir self-consciousness. Boldness directs attention outward and keeps \nthe illusion alive. It never induces awkwa rdness or embarrassment. And \nso we admire the bold, and prefer to be around them, because their self­\nconfidence infects us and draws us outside OUf own realm of inwardness \nand reflection. \nFew are born bold. Even Napoleon had to cultivate the habit on the \nbattlefield, where he knew it was a matter of life and death. In social set­\ntings he was awkward and timid, but he overcame this and practiced bold­\nness in every part of his life because he saw its tremendous power, how it \ncould literally enlarge a man (even one who, like Napoleon, was in fact \nconspicuously small). We also see this change in Ivan the Terrible: A harm­\nless boy suddenly transforms himself into a powerful young man who com­\nmands authority, simply by pointing a finger and taking bold action. \nYou must practice and develop YOUf boldness. You will often find uses \nfor it. The best place to begin is often the delicate world of negotiat ion, par-THE BOY Ar\\D \nTHE :-.IETTLE \nA boy playing in the \nfields got stung by a \nnettle.

When Christo­\npher Columbus proposed that the Spanish court finance his voyage to the \nAmericas, he also made the insanely bold demand that he be called \n\"Grand Admiral of the Ocean.\" The court agreed. The price he set was the \nprice he received-he demanded to be treated with respect, and so he was. \nHenry Kissinger too knew that in negotiation, bold demands work better \nthan starting off with piecemeal concessions and trying to meet the other \nperson halfway. Set your value high, and then, as Count Lustig did, set it \nhigher. \nUnderstand : If boldness is not natural, neither is timidity. It is an ac­\nquired habit, picked up out of adesire to avoid conflict. If timidity has \ntaken hold of you, then, root it out. Your fe ars of the consequences of a \nbold action are way out of proportion to reality, and in fact the conse­\nquences of timidity are worse. Your value is lowered and you create a self­\nfulfilling cyde of doubt and disaster. Rememb er: The problems created by \nan audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater \naudacity. \nImage: The Lion and the \nHare. The lion creates no \ngaps in his way-his \nmovements are too \nswift, his jaws too quick \nand powerful. The \ntimid hare will do any­\nthing to escape danger, \nbut in its haste to \nretreat and flee, it backs \ninto traps, hops smack \ninto its enemies' jaws. \nAuthority: I certainly think that it is better to be impetuous than \ncautious, for fortune is a woman, and it is necessary, if you wish to \nmaster her, to conquer her by force; and it can be seen that she lets \nherself be overcome by the bold rather than by those who proceed \ncoldly. And therefore, like a woman, she is always a friend to \nthe young, because they are less cautious, fiercer, and master \nher with greater audacity. (Niccolö Machiavelli, 1469-1527) \nREVERSAL \nBoldness should never be the strategy behind all of your actions. It is a tac­\ntical instrument, to be used at the right moment. Plan and think ahead, and \nmake the final element the bold move that will bring you success. In other \nwords, since boldness is a leamed response, it is also one that you leam to \ncontrol and utilize at will. To go through life armed only with audacity \nwould be tiring and also fatal. You would offend too many people, as is \nproven by those who cannot control their boldness. One such person was \nLola Montez; her audacity brought her triumphs and led to her seduction \nof the king of Bavaria. But since she could never rein in her boldness, it \nalso led to her downfall-in Bavaria, in England, wherever she tumed. It \ncrossed the border between boldness and the appearance of cruelty, even \ninsanity. Ivan the Terrible suffered the same fate: When the power of bold­\nness brought hirn success, he stuck to it, to the point where it became a life­\nlong pattern of violence and sadism. He lost the ability to tell when \nboldness was appropriate and when it was not. \nTimidity has no place in the realm of power; you will often benefit, \nhowever, by being able to feign it. At that point, of course, it is no longer \ntimidity but an offensive weapon: You are luring people in with your show \nof shyness, all the better to pounce on them boldly later. \nLAW 28 235 \n236 LAW \n29 \nPLAN ALL THE WAY \nTO THE EN D \nJUDGMENT \nThe ending is everything.

Several miles out of port, a stowaway climbed out of a \nprovision ehest: Va sco Nufiez de Balboa, a noble Spaniard who had come \nto the New World in search of gold but had fallen into debt and had es­\neaped his creditors by hiding in the ehest. \nBalboa had been obsessed with gold ever since Columbus had re­\nturned to Spain from his voyages with tales of a fabulous but as yet undis­\neovered kingdom called EI Dorado. Balboa was one of the first \nadventurers to come in search of Columbus's land of gold, and he had de­\neided from the beginning that he would be the one to find it, through \nsheer audacity and single-mi ndedness. Now that he was free of his credi­\ntors, nothing would stop hirn. \nUnfortunately the ship's owner, a wealthy jurist named Francisco Fer­\nnändez de Enciso, was furious when told of the stowaway, and he ordered \nthat Balboa be left on the first island they came acro ss. Before they found \nany island, however, Enciso received news that the colony he was to res­\neue had been abandoned. This was Balboa's chance. He told the sailors of \nhis previous voyages to Panama, and of the rumors he had heard of gold \nin the area. The excited sailors convinced Enciso to spare Balboa's life, \nand to establish a colony in Panama. Weeks later they named their new \nsettlement \"Darien.\" \nDarien's first governor was Enciso, but Balboa was not a man to let \nothers steal the initiative. He campaigned against Enciso among the \nsailors, who eventually made it clear that they preferred hirn as governor. \nEnciso fled to Spain, fearing for his life. Months later, when a representa­\ntive of the Spanish crown arrived to establish hirnself as the new, official \ngovernor of Darien, he was turned away. On his return voyage to Spain, \nthis man drowned; the drowning was accidental, but under Spanish law, \nBalboa had murdered the governor and usurped his position. \nBalboa's bravado had got hirn out of scrapes before, but now his \nhopes of wealth and glory seemed doomed. To lay claim to EI Dorado, \nshould he discover it, he would need the approval of the Spanish king­\nwhich, as an outlaw, he would never receive. There was only one solution. \nPanamanian Indians had told Balboa of a vast ocean on the other side of \nthe Central American isthmus, and had said that by traveling south upon \nthis western coast, he would reach a fabulous land of gold, called by a \nname that to his ears sounded like \"Biru.\" Balboa decided he would cross \nthe treacherous jungles of Panama and become the first European to bathe \nhis feet in this new ocean. From there he would march on EI Dorado. If he \ndid this on Spain's behalf, he would obtain the eternal gratitude of the \nking, and would seeure his own reprieve-only he had to act before Span­\nish authorities came to arrest hirn. \nIn 1513, then, Balboa set out, with 190 soldiers. Halfway across the \nisthmus (some ninety miles wide at that point), only sixty soldiers re-There are very few \nmen-and they are the \nexceptions-who are \nable to think and feel \nbeyond the present \nmoment. \nCARL VON CLAUSEWITZ, \n1780-1831 \nTIlE TWO FHOCS \nTwo frogs dwelt in the \nsame pool.

Finally, from a mountaintop, \nBalboa became the first European to lay eyes on the Pacific Ocean. Days \nlater he marched in his armor into its waters, bearing the banner of Castile \nand claiming all its seas, lands, and islands in the name of the Spanish \nthrone. \nIndians from the area greeted Balboa with gold, jewels, and precious \npearls, the like of which he had never seen. When he asked where these \nhad come from, the Indians pointed south, to the land of the Incas. But \nBalboa had only a few soldiers left. For the moment, he decided, he \nshould return to Darien, send the jewels and gold to Spain as a token \nof good will, and ask for a large army to aid hirn in the conquest of EI \nDorado, \nWhen news reached Spain of Balboa's bold crossing of the isthmus, \nhis discovery of the western ocean, and his planned conquest of EI Do­\nrado, the former criminal became a hero, He was instantly proclaimed \ngovernor of the new land. But before the king and queen received word of \nhis discovery, they had already sent a dozen ships, under the command of \na man named Pedro Arias Davila, \"Pedrarias ,\" with orders to arrest Bal­\nboa for murder and to take command of the colony. By the time Pedrarias \narrived in Panama, he had learned that Balboa had been pardoned, and \nthat he was to share the governorship with the former outlaw. \nAll the same, Balboa felt uneasy, Gold was his dream, EI Dorado his \nonly desire. In pursuit of this goal he had nearly died many times over, \nand to share the wealth and glory with a newcomer would be intolerable, \nHe also soon discovered that Pedrarias was a jealous, bitter man, and \nequally unhappy with the situation. Once again, the only solution for Bal­\nboa was to seize the initiative by propos ing to cross the jungle with a \nlarger army, carrying ship-building materials and tools. Once on the Pa­\ncific coast, he would create an armada with which to conquer the Incas. \nSurprisingly enough, Pedrarias agreed to the plan-perhaps sensing it \nwould never work. Hundreds died in this second march through the jun­\ngle, and the timber they carried rotted in the torrential rains. Balboa, as \nusual, was undaunted-no power in the world could thwart his plan-and \non arriving at the Pacific he began to cut down trees for new lumb er. But \nthe men remaining to hirn were to� few and too weak to mount an inva­\nsion, and once again Balboa had to return to Darien, \nPedrarias had in any case invited Balboa back to discuss a new plan, \nand on the outskirts of the settlement, the explorer was met by Francisco \nPizarro, an old friend who had accompanied him on his first crossing of \nthe isthmus. But this was a trap: Leading one hundred soldiers, Pizarro \nsurrounded his former friend, arrested hirn, and returned hirn to Pe­\ndrarias, who tried him on charges of rebellion. A few days later Balboa's \nhead fell into a basket, along with those of his most trusted followers, \nYears later Pizarro hirnself reached Peru, and Balboa's deeds were for­\ngotten. \nInterpretation \nMost men are ruled by the heart, not the head. Their plans are vague, and \nwhen they meet obstacles they improvis e. But improvisation will only \nbring you as far as the next crisis, and is never a substitute for thinking \nseveral steps ahead and planning to the end. \nBalboa had a dream of glory and wealth, and a vague plan to reach it. \nYet his bold deeds, and his discovery of the Pacific, are largely forgotten, \nfor he committed what in the world of power is the ultimate sin: He went \npart way, leaving the door open for others to take over. A real man of \npower would have had the prudence to see the dangers in the distance­\nthe rivals who would want to share in the conquests, the vultures that \nwould hover once they heard the word \"gol d.\" Balboa should have kept \nhis knowledge of the Incas secret until after he had conquered Peru. Only \nthen would his wealth, and his head, have been secure. Once Pedrarias ar­\nrived on the scene, a man of power and prudence would have schemed to \nkill or imprison hirn, and to take over the army he had brought for the \nconquest of Peru. But Balboa was locked in the moment, always reacting \nemotionally, never thinking ahead. \nWhat good is it to have the greatest dream in the world if others reap \nthe benefits and the glory ? Never lose your head over a vague, open­\nended dream-plan to the end. \nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW \nIn 1863 the Prussian premier Otto von Bismarck surveyed the chessboa rd \nof European power as it then stood. The main players were England, \nFrance, and Austria. Prussia itself was one of several states in the loosely \nallied German Federation. Austria, dominant member of the Federation, \nmade sure that the other German states remained weak, divided and sub­\nmissive. Bismarck believed that Prussia was destined for something far \ngreater than servant boy to Austria. \nThis is how Bismarck played the game. His first move was to start a \nwar with lowly Denmark, in order to recover the former Prussian lands of \nSchieswig-Hoistein. He knew that these rumblings of Prussian indepen­\ndence might worry France and England, so he enlisted Austria in the war, \nclaiming that he was recovering Schleswig-Hoistein for their benefit. In a \nfew months, after the war was decided, Bismarck demanded that the \nnewly conquered lands be made part of Prussia. The Austrians of course \nwere furious, but they compromised: First they agreed to give the Prus­\nsians Schleswig, and a year later they sold them Holstein. The world \nbegan to see that Austria was weakening and that Prussia was on the rise. \nBismarck's next move was his boldest: In 1866 he convinced King \nWilliam of Prussia to withdraw from the German Federation, and in doing \nso to go to war with Austria itself. King William's wife, his son the crown \nprince, and the princes of the other German kingdoms vehemently op­\nposed such a war. But Bismarck, undaunted, succeeded in forcing the con­\nflict, and Prussia's superior army defeated the Austrians in the brutally unaware of the fact that \nwe should think weil \nbefore doing anything. \nBut we are daily guilty \nofnot remember ing, \nand the eonsequenees \nare evil. I very much \nvalue this dervish's \nadvice. \" \nThe king decided to \nbear the adviee always \nin his mind, and com­\nmanded it to be written \nin gold on the walls \nand even engraved on \nhis silver plate. \nNot long afterward a \nplotter desired to kill \nthe king. He bribed the \nroyal surgeon with a \npromise of the prime \nministership if he thrust \na poisoned laneet into \nthe king's arm. When \nthe time came to let \nsome ofthe king's \nblood, a silver basin \nwas placed to catch the \nblood. Suddenly the \nsurgeon became aware \nofthe words engraved \nupon it: \"Never begin \nanything until you have \nrejteeted what will be \nthe end of it.\" It was \nonly then that he real­\nized that if the plotter \nbecame king he eould \nhave the surgeon killed \ninstantly, and would \nnot need to fulfill his \nbargain. \nThe king, seeing that \nthe surgeon was now \ntrembling, asked him \nwhat was wrimg with \nhim. And so he \neonfessed the truth, at \nthat very moment . \nThe plotter was seized; \nand the king sent for all \nthe people who had \nbeen present when the \nabdal gave his adviee, \nand said to them: \"Do \nyou stililaugh at the \ndervish? \" \nCARAVAN OF DREAMS, \nIDRIES SHAH, 1968 \nLAW 29 239 \nHe who asks fortune­\ntellers the future \nunwittingly forfeits an \ninner intimation of \ncoming events that is a \nthousand times more \nexact than anything \nthey may say. \nW ALTFR BENJAMIN. \n1892�1 940 \n240 LAW 29 short Seven Weeks War. The king and the Prussian generals then wanted \nto march on Vienna, taking as much land from Austria as possible. But \nBismarck stopped them-now he presented himself as on the side of \npeace. The result was that he was able to conclude a treaty with Austria \nthat granted Prussia and the other German states total autonomy. Bis­\nmarck could now position Prussia as the dominant power in Germany and \nthe head of a newly formed North German Confederation. \nThe French and the English began to compare Bismarck to Attila the \nHun, and to fear that he had designs on all ofEurope. Once he had started \non the path to conquest, there was no telling where he would stop. And, \nindeed, three years later Bismarck provoked a war with France. First he \nappeared to give his permission to France's annexation of Belgium, then \nat the last moment he changed his mind. Playing a cat-and-mouse garne, \nhe infuriated the French emperor, Napoleon III, and stirred up his own \nking against the French. To no one's surprise, war broke out in 1870. The \nnewly formed German federation enthusiastically joined in the war \non France, and once again the Prussian military machine and its allies \ndestroyed the enemy army in a matter of months. Although Bismarck \nopposed taking any French land, the generals convin ced him that Alsace­\nLorraine would become part of the federatio n. \nNow all of Europe feared the next move of the Prussian monster, led \nby Bismarck, the \"lron Chancellor. \" And in fact a year later Bismarck \nfounded the German Empire, with the Prussian king as the newly \ncrowned emperor and Bismarck himself a prince. But then something \nstrange happened: Bismarck instigated no more wars. And while the other \nEuropean powers grabbed up land for colonies in other continents, he se­\nverely limited Germany 's colonial acquisiti ons. He did not want more \nland for Germany, but more security. For the rest of his life he struggled to \nmaintain peace in Europe and to prevent further wars. Everybody as­\nsumed he had change d, mellowing with the years. They had failed to un­\nderstand: This was the final move of his original plan. \nInterpretation \nThere is a simple reason why most men never know when to come off the \nattack: They form no concrete idea of their goal. Once they achieve vic­\ntory they only hunger for more. To stop-to aim for a goal and then keep \nto it-seems almost inhuman, in fact; yet nothing is more critical to the \nmaintenance of power. The person who goes too far in his triumphs cre­\nates areaction that inevitably leads to a decline. The only solution is to \nplan for the long run. Foresee the future with as much clarity as the gods \non Mount Olympus, who look through the clouds and see the ends of all \nthings. \nFrom the beginning of his career in politics, Bismarck had one goal: \nto form an independent German state led by Prussia. He inst igated the \nwar with Denmark not to conquer territory but to stir up Prussian nation­\nalism and unite the country. He incited the war with Austria only to gain \nPrussian independence. (This was why he refused to grab Austrian terri­\ntory.) And he fomented the war with France to unite the German king­\ndoms against a common enemy, and thus to prepare for the formation of a \nunited Germany. \nOnce this was achieved, Bismarck stopped. He never let triumph go \nto his head, was never tempted by the siren call of more. He held the reins \ntightly, and whenever the generals, or the king, or the Prussian people de­\nmanded new conquests, he held them back. Nothing would spoil the \nbeauty of his creation, certainly not a false euphoria that pushed those \naround hirn to attempt to go past the end that he had so carefully planned. \nExpenence shows that, if one foresees from far away the designs to be \nundertaken, one can act with speed when the moment comes to execute them. \nCardinal Richelieu, 158 5-1642 \nKEYS TO POWER \nAccording to the cosmology of the ancient Greeks, the gods were thought \nto have complete vision into the future. They saw everything to come, \nright down to the intricate detai ls. Men, on the other hand, were seen as \nvictims of fate, trapped in the moment and their emotions, unable to see \nbeyond immediate dangers. Those heroes, such as Odysseus, who were \nable to look beyond the present and plan several steps ahead, seemed to \ndefy fate, to approximate the gods in their ability to determine the future. \nThe comparison is still valid-those among us who think further ahead \nand patiently bring their plans to fruition seem to have a godlike power. \nBecause most people are too imprisoned in the moment to plan with \nthis kind of foresight, the ability to ignore immediate dangers and plea­\nsures translates into power. It is the power of being able to overcome the \nnatural human tendency to react to things as they happen, and instead to \ntrain oneself to step back, imagining the larger things taking shape beyond \none's immediate vision. Most people believe that they are in fact aware of \nthe future, that they are planning and thinking ahead. They are usually de­\nluded: What they are really doing is succumbing to their desires, to what \nthey want the future to be. Their plans are vague, based on their imagina­\ntions rather than their reality. They may believe they are thinking all the \nway to the end, but they are really only focusing on the happy ending, and \ndeluding themselves by the strength of their desire. \nIn 415 B.C., the ancient Athenians attacked Sicily, believing their ex­\npedition would bring them riches, power, and a glorious ending to the six­\nteen-year Peloponnesian War. They did not consider the dangers of an \ninvasion so far from horne; they did not foresee that the Sicilians would \nfight all the harder since the battles were in their own homeland, or that \nall of Athens's enemies would band together against them, or that war \nwould break out on several fronts, stretching their forces way too thin. \nThe Sicilian expedition was a complete dis aster, leading to the destruction \nLAW 29 241 \n242 LAW 29 of one of the greatest civilizations of all time. The Athenians were led into \nthis disaster by their hearts, not their minds. They saw only the chance of \nglory, not the dangers that loomed in the dista nce. \nCardinal de Retz, the sevente enth-century Frenchman who prided \nhimself on his insights into human schemes and why they mostly fail, ana­\nlyzed this phenomenon. In the course of arebellion he spearheaded \nagainst the French mona rchy in 1651, the young king, Louis XIV, and his \ncourt had suddenly left Paris and established themselves in a palace out­\nside the capital. The presence of the king so dose to the heart of the revo­\nlution had been a tremendous burden on the revolut iona ries, and they \nbreathed a sigh of relief. This later proved their downfall, however, since \nthe court' s absence from Paris gave it much more room to maneuver. \n\"The most ordinary cause of people's mistake s,\" Cardinal de Retz later \nwrote, \"is their being too much fright ened at the present danger, and not \nenough so at that which is remote .\" \nThe dangers that are remote, that 100m in the distance-if we can see \nthem as they take shape, how many mistakes we avoid. How many plans \nwe would instantly abort if we realized we were avoiding a small danger \nonly to step into a larger one. So much of power is not what you do but \nwhat you do not do-the rash and foolish actions that you refrain from be­\nfore they get you into trouble. Plan in detail be fore you act-do not let \nvague plans lead you into trouble . Will this have unin tended conse­\nquences? Will I stir up new enemie s? Will someone else take advantage of \nmy labors? Unhappy endings are much more common than happy \nones-do not be swayed by the happy ending in your mind. \nThe French elections of 1848 came down to a struggle between Louis­\nAdolphe Thiers, the man of order, and General Louis Eugene Cavaignac, \nthe rabble-rouser of the right. When Thiers realized he was hopelessly be­\nhind in this high- stakes race, he searched desp erately for a solut ion. His \neye fell on Louis Bona parte, grand- nephew ofthe great general Napoleon, \nand a lowly deputy in the parlia ment. This Bonap arte seemed a bit of an \nimbecile, but his name alone could get him elected in a country yearning \nfor a strong ruler. He would be Thiers's puppet and event ually would be \npushed offstage . The first part of the plan worked to perfection, and \nNapoleon was elected by a large margin. The problem was that Thiers \nhad not foreseen one simple fact: This \"imbecile\" was in fact a man of \nenormous ambit ion. Three years later he dissolved parliament, dedared \nhimself emperor, and ruled France for another eighteen years, much to \nthe horror of Thiers and his party. \nThe ending is everything. It is the end of the action that determines \nwho gets the glory, the money, the prize. Your condusion must be crystal \nclear, and you must keep it constantly in mind. You must also figure out \nhow to ward off the vultur es circling overhead, trying to live off the car­\ncass of your creation. And you must anticipate the many possible crises \nthat will tempt you to improv ise. Bismarck overcame these dangers be­\ncause he plan ned to the end, kept on course through every crisis, and \nnever let others steal the glory. Once he had reached his stated goal, he \nwithdrew into his shelllike a turtle. This kind of self-control is godlike. \nWhen you see several steps ahead, and plan your moves all the way \nto the end, you will no longer be tempted by emotion or by the desire to \nimprovise. Your elarity will rid you of the anxiety and vagueness that are \nthe primary reasons why so many fail to conelude their actions success­\nfully. You see the ending and you tolerate no deviation. \nImage: \nThe Gods on \nMount Olympus. \nLooking down on \nhuman actions from the \nelouds, they see in advance the \nendings of all the great dreams that \nlead to disaster and tragedy. And \nthey laugh at our inability to see beyond \nthe moment, and at how we delude ourselves. \nAuthority: How much easier it is never to get in than to get yourself \nout! We should act contrary to the reed which, when it first appears, \nthrows up a long straight stern but afterwards, as though it were ex­\nhausted ... makes several dense knots, indicating that it no longer \nhas its original vigor and drive. We must rather begin gently and \neooUy, saving our breath for the eneounter and our vigorous thrusts \nfor finishing off the job. In their beginnings it is we who guide affairs \nand hold them in our power; but so often onee they are set in motion, \nit is they which guide us and sweep us along. (Montaigne, 1533-1592) \nLAW 29 243 \n244 LAW 29 REVERSAL \nIt is a diche among strategists that your plan must indude alternatives and \nhave a degree of flexibility. That is certainly true. If you are locked into a \nplan too rigidly, you will be unable to deal with sudden shifts of fortune. \nOnce you have examined the future possibilities and decided on your tar­\nget, you must build in alternatives and be open to new routes toward your \ngoal. \nMost people, however, lose less from overplanning and rigidity than \nfrom vagueness and a tendency to improvise constantly in the face of cir­\ncumstance. There is no real purpose in contemplating areversal to this \nLaw, then, for no good can come from refusing to think far into the future \nand planning to the end. If you are dear-and far-thinking enough, you \nwill understand that the future is uncertain, and that you must be open to \nadaptation.

Al­\nthough not from a noble family, Rikyu rose to great power, becoming the \npreferred tea master of the Emperor Hideyoshi, and an important adviser \non aesthetic and even political matters. For Rikyu, the secret of success \nconsisted in appearing natural, concealing the effort behind one's work. \nOne day Rikyu and his son went to an acquainta nce's house for a tea \nceremony. On the way in, the son remarked that the lovely antique-Iook­\ning gate at their host's house gave it an evocatively lonely appeara nce. \"I \ndon't think so,\" replied his father, \"it looks as though it had been brought \nfrom some mountain temple a long way off, and as if the labor required to \nimport it must have cost a lot of money. \" If the owner of the house had put \nthis much effort into one gate, it would show in his tea ceremo ny-and in­\ndeed Sen no Rikyu had to leave the ceremony early, unable to endure the \naffeetation and effort it inadvertently revealed. \nOn another evening, while having tea at a friend's house, Rikyu saw \nhis host go outside, hold up alantern in the darkness, cut a lernon off a tree, \nand bring it in. This charmed Rikyu-the host needed a relish for the dish \nhe was serving, and had spontaneously gone outside to get one. But when \nthe man offered the lemon with some Osaka rice cake, Rikyu realized that \nhe had planned the cutting of the lemon all along, to go with this expensive \ndelicacy. The ge sture no longer seemed spontaneous-it was a way for the \nhost to prove his cleverness. He had accidentally revealed how hard he \nwas trying. Having seen enough, Rikyu politely declined the cake, excused \nhirnself, and left. \nEmperor Hideyoshi once planned to visit Rikyu for a tea ceremon y. \nOn the night before he was to come, snow began to fall. Thinking quickly, \nRikyu laid round cushions that fit exactly on each of the stepping-stones \nthat led through the garden to his house. Just before dawn, he rose, saw \nthat it had stopped snowing, and carefully removed the cushions. When \nHideyoshi arrived, he marveled at the simple beauty of the sight-the per­\nfectly round stepping stones, unencumbered by snow-and noticed how it \ncalled no attention to the manner in which Rikyu had accomplished it, but \nonly to the polite gesture itself. \nAfter Sen no Rikyu died, his ideas had a profound influence on the \npractice of the tea ceremon y. The Tokugawa shogun Yorinobu, son of the \ngreat Emperor Ieyasu, was a student of Rikyu's teachings. In his garden he \nhad a stone lantern made by a famous master, and Lord Sakai Tadakatsu \nasked if he could come by one day to see it. Yorinobu replied that he would \nbe honored, and commanded his gardeners to put everything in order for \nthe visit. These gardeners, unfamiliar with the precepts of Cha-no-yu, \nthought the stone lantern missha pen, its windows being too small for the \npresent taste. They had a local workman enlarge the windows. A few days \nbefore Lord Sakai's visit, Yorinobu toured the garden. When he saw the al-\ntered windows he exploded with rage, ready to impale on his sword the \nfool who had ruined the lantem, upsetting its natural grace and destroying \nthe whole purpose of Lord Sakai's visit. \nWhen Yorinobu calmed down, however, he remembered that he had \noriginally bought two of the lantems, and that the second was in his garden \non the island of Kishu. At great expense, he hired a whale boat and the \nfinest rowers he could find, ordering them to bring the lantem to hirn \nwithin two days-a difficult feat at best. But the sailors rowed day and \nnight, and with the luck of a good wind they arrived just in time. To Yori­\nnobu's delight, this stone lantem was more magnificent than the first, for it \nhad stood untouched for twenty years in a bamboo thicket, acquiring a \nbrilliant antique appearance and a delicate covering of moss. When Lord \nSakai arrived, later that same day, he was awed by the lantem, which was \nmore magnificent than he had imagined-so graceful and at one with the \nelements. Fortunately he had no idea what time and effort it had cost Yori­\nnobu to create this sublime effect. \nInterpretation \nTo Sen no Rikyu, the sudden appearance of something naturally, almost \naccidentally graceful was the height of beauty. This beauty came without \nwarning and seemed effortless. Nature created such things by its own laws \nand processes, but men had to create their effects through labor and con­\ntrivance. And when they showed the effort of producing the effect, the ef­\nfeet was spoiled. The gate came from too far away, the cutting of the lemon \nlooked contrived. \nYou will often have to use tricks and ingenuity to create your effects­\nthe cushions in the snow, the men rowing all night-but your audience \nmust never suspect the work or the thinking that has gone into them.

They contained six sets of locks and \nnine tumbiers in each cuff; a Birmingham maker had spent five years con­\nstructing them. Experts who examined them said they had never seen any­\nthing so intricate, and this intricacy was thought to make them impossible \nto escape. \nThe crowd watched the experts secure the manacles on Houdini's \nwrists. Then the escape artist entered a black cabinet on stage. The minutes swallows over willow \ntrees. When Masamune \nsaw the finished work \nhe was as overjoyed at \nthe artist's skill as he \nhad previously been \nannoyed at the appar­\nent mess he was \nmaking of the screens. \nCHA-NO-YlJ: \nTHE JAPANESE TEA \nCEREMONY \nA. L. SADLER, 1962 \nTI Ii': \\\\ HISI'LI :\\C \nM,\\STEH \nThere was once a \nwrestling master who \nwas versal in 360 feints \nand holds. He took a \nspecialliking tu one of \nhis pupils, to whom he \ntaught 359 of them over \naperiod of time. Some­\nhow he never got \naround tu the tast trick. \nAs months went by the \nyoung man became so \nprofiäent in the art that \nhe bested everyone who \ndared to face him in the \nring. He was so proud \nof his prowess that one \nday he boasted berore \nthe sultan that he could \nreadily whip his master, \nwere it not out of \nrespect for his age and \ngratitude for his \ntutetage. \nThe sultan became \nincensed at this irre ver­\nence and ordered an \nimmediate match wäh \nthe royal court in \nattendance. \nAt the gong fhe youth \nbarged forward with a \ntusty yell, only to be \nconfronted with the \nunfamiliar 360th feint. \nLAW 30 247 \nThe master seized his \nformer pupil, lifted hirn \nhigh above his head, \nand jlung hirn crashing \nto the ground. The \nsultan and the assem-\nbly let out a loud cheer. \nWhen the sultan asked \nthe master how he was \nable to overcome such \na strong opponent, the \nmaster confessed that \nhe had reserved a secret \ntechnique for hirnself \nfor just such a contin­\ngency. Then he related \nthe lamentation of a \nmaster of archery, who \ntaught everything he \nknew. \"No one has \nlearned archery fram \nme,\" the poor fellow \ncomplained, \"who has \nnot tried to use me as a \nbutt in the end. \" \nA STORY OF SAADI, \nAS TOLD IN \nTHE CRAF T OF POWER, \nR.G. H. SlU, 1979 \n248 LAW 30 went by; the more time passed, the more certain it seemed that these man­\naeles would be the first to defeat him. At one point he emerged from the \ncabinet, and asked that the cuffs be temporarily removed so that he could \ntake off his coat-it was hot inside. The challengers refused, suspecting his \nrequest was a trick to find out how the locks worked. Undeterred, and with­\nout using his hands, Houdini managed to lift the coat over his shoulders, \nturn it inside out, remove a penknife from his vest pocket with his teeth, \nand, by moving his head, cut the coat off his arms. Freed from the coat, he \nstepped back into the cabinet, the audience roaring with approval at his \ngrace and dexterity. \nFinally, having kept the audience waiting long enough, Houdini \nemerged from the cabinet a second time, now with his hands free, the man­\naeles raised high in triumph. To this day no one knows how he managed \nthe escape. Although he had taken elose to an hour to free himself, he had \nnever looked concerned, had shown no sign of doubt. Indeed it seemed by \nthe end that he had drawn out the escape as a way to heighten the drama, \nto make the audience worry-for there was no other sign that the perfor­\nmance had been anything but easy. The complaint ab out the heat was \nequally part of the act. The spectators of this and other Houdini perfor­\nmances must have feit he was toying with them: These manaeles are noth­\ning, he seemed to say, I could have freed myself a lot sooner, and from a \nlot worse. \nOver the years, Houdini escaped from the chained carcass of an em­\nbalmed \"sea monster\" (a half octopus, half whalelike beast that had \nbeached near Boston); he had himself sealed inside an enormous envelope \nfrom which he emerged without breaking the paper; he passed through \nbrick walls; he wriggled free from strailjackets while dangling high in the \nair; he leaped from bridges into icy waters, his hands manaeled and his legs \nin chains; he had himself submerged in glass cases full ofwater, hands pad­\nlocked, while the audience watched in amazement as he worked himself \nfree, struggling for elose to an hour apparently without breathing. Each \ntime he seemed to court certain death yet survived with superhuman \naplomb. Meanwhile, he said nothing about his methods, gave no elues as \nto how he accompli shed any of his tricks-he left his audiences and critics \nspeculating, his power and reputation enhanced by their struggles with the \ninexplica ble, Perhaps the most baffling trick of all was making a ten-thou­\nsand-pound elephant disappear before an audience's eyes, a feat he re­\npeated on stage for over nineteen weeks. No one has ever really explained \nhow he did this, for in the auditorium where he performed the trick, there \nwas simply nowhere for an elephant to hide. \nThe effortlessness of Houdini's escapes led some to think he used oc­\ncuIt forces, his superior psychic abilities giving him special control over his \nbody. But a German escape artist named Kleppini elaimed to know Hou­\ndini's secret: He simply used elaborate gadgets, Kleppini also elaimed to \nhave defeated Houdini in a handcuff challenge in Holland. \nHoudini did not mind all kinds of speculation floating around ab out \nhis methods, but he would not tolerate an outright lie, and in 1902 he ehal­\nlenged Kleppini to a handeuff duel. Kleppini aeeepted. Through a spy, he \nfound out the seeret word to unloek a pair of Freneh eombinati on-loek \ncuffs that Houdini liked to use. His plan was to ehoose these euffs to eseape \nfrom onstage . This would definitively debunk Houdini-his \"genius\" sim­\nply lay in his use of meehanieal gadgets. \nOn the night of the ehallenge, just as Kleppini had planned, Houdini \noffered hirn a ehoice of euffs and he seleeted the ones with the eombination \nlock. He was even able to disappear with them behind a sereen to make a \nquick test, and reemerged seeonds later, eonfident of vietory. \nAeting as if he sensed fraud, Houdini refused to loek Kleppini in the \ncuffs. The two men argued and began to fight, even wrestling with each \nother onstage . Mter a few minutes of this, an apparently angry, frustrated \nHoudini gave up and loeked Kleppini in the euffs. For the next few minutes \nKleppini strained to get free. Something was wrong-min utes earlier he \nhad opened the euffs behind the sereen; now the same eode no longer \nworked. He sweated, raeking his brains. Hours went by, the audienee left, \nand finally an exhausted and humiliated Kleppini gave up and asked to be \nreleased. \nThe euffs that Kleppini hirnself had opened behind the sereen with the \nword \"C-L-E-F-S\" (Freneh for \"keys\") now clieked open only with the \nword \"F-R-A-U-D. \"Kleppini never figured out how Houdini had aecom­\nplished this uneanny feat. \nInterpretation \nAlthough we do not know for eertain how Houdini aeeomplished many of \nhis most ingenious eseapes, one thing is clear: It was not the oeeult, or any \nkind of magie, that gave him his powers, but hard work and endless prae­\ntice, all of whieh he earefully eoneealed from the world. Houdini never left \nanything to ehanee-day and night he studied the workings of locks, re­\nsearehed eenturies-old sleight-of-hand tricks, pored over books on meehan­\nics, whatever he eould use. Every moment not spent researehing he spent \nworking his body, keeping hirnself exeeptionally limber, and learning how \nto eontrol his muscles and his breathing. \nEarly on in Houdini's eareer, an old Japanese performer whom he \ntoured with taught hirn an ancient trick: how to swallow an ivory ball, then \nbring it baek up. He practieed this endlessly with a small peeled potato tied \nto a string-up and down he would manipulate the potato with his throat \nmuscles, until they were strong enough to move it without the string. The \norganizers of the London handeuff challenge had searehed Houdin i's body \nthoroughly beforehand, but no one eould cheek the inside of his throat, \nwhere he eould have eoneealed small tools to help hirn eseape. Even so, \nKleppini was fundamentally wrong: It was not Houdin i's tools but his prae­\ntiee, work, and research that made his eseapes possible. \nKleppini, in fact, was eompletely outwitted by Houdini, who set the \nwhole thing up. He let his opponent learn the eode to the Freneh euffs, Keep the extent 01 your \nabilities unknown. The \nwise man does not \nallow his knowledge \nand abilWes to be \nsounded to the bottom, \nil he desires to be \nhonored by all. He \nallows you to know \nthem but not to \ncomprehend them. No \none must know the \nextent 01 his abilities, \nlest he be disappointed. \nNo one ever has an \nopportunity ollathom­\ning him entirely. For \nguesses and doubts \nabout the extent 01 his \ntalents arouse more \nveneration than accu­\nrate knowledge 01 \nthem, be they ever so \ngreat. \nBALTASAR GRACIAN, \n1601-1 658 \nLAW 30 249 \n250 LAW 30 then baited hirn into choosing those cuffs onstage. Then, during the two \nmen's tussle, the dexterous Houdini was able to change the code to ''F-R­\nA-U-D.\" He had spent weeks practicing this trick, but the audience saw \nnone of the sweat and toil behind the scenes. Nor was Houdini ever ner­\nvous; he induced nervousness in others. (He deliberately dragged out the \ntime it would take to escape, as a way of heightening the drama, and mak­\ning the audience squirm.) His escapes from death, always graceful and \neasy, made hirn look like a superman. \nAs a person of power, you must research and practice endlessly before \nappearing in public, onstage or anywhere else. Never expose the sweat and \nlabor behind your poise. Some think such exposure will demonstrate their \ndiligence and honesty, but it actually just makes them look weaker-as if \nanyone who practiced and worked at it could do what they had done, or as \nif they weren't really up to the job. Keep your effort and your tricks to \nyourself and you seem to have the grace and ease of a god. One never sees \nthe source of a god's power revea led; one only sees its effects. \nA line [01 poetryj will take us hours maybe; \nYet if it does not seem a moment 's thou ght, \nDur stitching and unstitching has been naught. \nAdam's eurse, William Butler Yeats, 1865-1 939 \nKEYS TO POWER \nHumanity's first notions of power came from primitive encounters with na­\nture-the flash of lightning in the sky, a sudden flood, the speed and feroc­\nity of a wild animal. These forces required no thinking, no planning-they \nawed us by their sudden appearance, their gracefuln ess, and their power \nover life and death. And this remains the kind of power we have always \nwanted to imitate. Through science and technology we have re-created the \nspeed and sublime power of nature, but something is missing: Our ma­\nchines are noisy and jerky, they reveal their effort. Even the very best cre­\nations of technology cannot root out our admiration for things that move \neasily and effortlessly. The power of children to bend us to their will comes \nfrom a kind of seductive charm that we feel in the presence of a creature \nless reflective and more graceful than we are. We cannot return to such a \nstate, but if we can create the appearance of this kind of ease, we elicit in \nothers the kind of primitive awe that nature has always evoked in hu­\n·mankind. \nOne of the first European writers to expound on this principle came \nfrom that most unnatural of environments, the Renaissance court. In 17ze \nBook of the Courtier, published in 1528, Baldassare Castiglione describes the \nhighly elaborate and codified manners of the perfect court citizen. And yet, \nCastiglione explains, the courtier must execute these gestures with what he \ncalls spre;zatura, the capacity to make the difficult seem easy. He urges the \ncourtier to \"practice in all things a certain nonchalance which conceals all \nartistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effort­\nless.\" We all admire the ach ievement of some unusual feat, but if it is ac­\ncomplished naturally and gracefully, our admiration increases tenfold­\n\"whereas . . . to labor at what one is doing and . . . to make bones over it, \nshows an extreme lack of grace and causes everything, whatever its worth, \nto be discounte d.\" \nMuch of the idea of sprezzatura came from the world of art. All the \ngreat Renaissance artists carefully kept their works under wrap s. Only the \nfinished master piece could be shown to the public. Michelangelo forbade \neven popes to view his work in process. A Rena issance artist was always \ncareful to keep his studios shut to patrons and public alike, not out of fear \nof imitati on, but because to see the making of the works would mar the \nmagic of their effect, and their studied atrno sphere of ease and natural \nbeauty. \nThe Rena issance painter Vasari, also the first great art critic, ridiculed \nthe work of Paolo Uccello, who was obsessed with the laws of perspect ive. \nThe effo rt Uccello spent on improving the appearance of perspect ive was \ntoo obvious in his work-it made his paintings ugly and labored, over­\nwhelmed by the effort of their effects. We have the same response when we \nwatch perform ers who put too much effo rt into their act: Seeing them try­\ning so hard breaks the illusion. 1t also makes us unco mfortabl e. Calm, \ngrac eful perf ormers, on the other hand, set us at ease, creating the illusion \nthat they are not acting but being natural and themselves, even when \neverything they are doing involves labor and practice. \nThe idea of sprezzatura is relevant to all forms of power, for power \ndepends vitally on appeara nces and the illusions you create. Your public \nactions are like artwo rks: They must have visual appeal, must create antici­\npation, even enterta in. When you reveal the inner workings of your cre­\nation, you become just one more morta1 among others . What is \nunderstandable is not awe-inspiri ng-we tell ourselves we could do as well \nif we had the money and time. Avoid the temptation of showing how \nclever you are-it is far more clever to conceal the mechanisms of your \ncleve rness. \nTalleyra nd's applicat ion of this concept to his daily life greatly en­\nhanced the aura of power that surrounded him. He never liked to work too \nhard, so he made others do the work for him-the spying, the research, the \ndetailed ana lyses. With all this labor at his disposal, he hirnself never \nseemed to strain. When his spies revealed that a certain event was about to \ntake place, he would talk in social conversation as if he sensed its immi­\nnence. The result was that people thought he was clairvoya nt. His short \npithy statements and wit ticisms always seemed to summarize a situat ion \nperf ectly, but they were based on much research and thought. To those in \ngovernment, including Napoleon hirnse lf, Talleyrand gave the impre ssion \nof immense pow er-an effect entirely dependent on the apparent ease \nwith which he accomplished his feats. \nThere is another reason for concea ling your shortcuts and tricks : \nLAW 30 251 \n252 LAW 30 When you let this information out, you give people ideas they can use \nagainst you. You lose the advantages of keeping silent. We tend to want the \nworld to know what we have done--we want our vanity gratified by hav­\ning OUf hard work and cleverness applauded, and we may even want sym­\npathy for the hOUfS it has taken to reach OUf point of artistry. Learn to \ncontrol this propensity to blab, for its effect is often the opposite of what \nyou expected. Remember: The more mystery surrounds YOUf actions, the \nmore awesome your power seems. You appear to be the only one who can \ndo what you do-and the appearance of having an exclusive gift is im­\nmensely powernd. Finally, because you achieve YOUf accomplis hments \nwith grace and ease, people believe that you could always do more if you \ntried harder. This elicits not only admiration but a touch of fear. YOUf pow­\ners are untapped-no one can fathom their limits. \nImage: The Racehorse. From up close we would see the \nstrain, the effort to control the horse, the labored, painful \nbreathing. But from the distance where we sit and watch, it \nis all gracefulness, flying through the air. Keep others at a \ndistance and they will only see the ease with which you move. \nAuthority: For whatever action [nonchalance] accompan ies, no \nmatter how trivial it is, it not only reveals the skill of the person \ndoing it but also very often ca uses it to be considered far greater \nthan it really iso This is because it makes the onlookers believe that \na man who performs weIl with so much facility must possess even \ngreater skill than he does. (Baldassare Castiglione, 1478-1529) \nREVERSAL \nThe secrecy with which you surround YOUf actions must seem lighthearted \nin spirit. A zeal to conceal YOUf work creates an unpleasant, almost para­\nnoiac impression: you are taking the game too seriously. Houdini was care­\nful to make the concealment of his tricks seem agame, all part of the show. \nNever show YOUf work until it is finished, but if you put too much effort \ninto keeping it under wraps you will be like the painter Pontormo, who \nspent the last years of his life hiding his frescoes from the public eye and \nonly succeeded in driving hirnself mad. Always keep your sense of humor \nabout yourself. \nThere are also times when revealing the inner workings of your pro­\njects can prove worthwh ile. It all depends on YOUf audience's taste, and on \nthe times in which you operate. P. T. Barnum recognized that his public \nwanted to feel involved in his shows, and that understanding his tricks de­\nlighted them, partly, perhaps, because implicitly debunking people who \nkept their sources of power hidden from the masses appealed to America' s \ndemocratic spirit. The public also appreciated the showma n's humor and \nhonesty. Bamum took this to the extreme of publicizing his own humbug­\ngery in his popular autobiogra phy, written when his career was at its \nheight. \nAs long as the partial disclosure of tricks and techniq ues is carefully \nplanned, rather than the result of an uncontrollable need to blab, it is the \nultimate in cleverne ss. It gives the audience the illusion of being superior \nand involved, even while much of what you do remains concealed from \nthem. \nLAW 30 253 \n254 LAW \n31 \nCO NT ROL THE OPT IONS: \nGET OTHERS TO PLAY WIT H \nTHE CA RDS YOU DEAL \nJUDGM ENT \nThe best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the \nother person a choice: Your victims feel they are in con­\ntrol, but are actually your puppets.

The greatest limit to his author­\nity came from the boyars, the Russian princely dass that domina ted the \ncountry and terrorized the peasantry. \nIn 1553, at the age of twenty-three, Ivan fell ill. Lying in bed, nearing \ndeath, he asked the boyars to swear allegiance to his son as the new czar. \nSome hesitate d, some even refused. Then and there Ivan saw he had no \npower over the boyars. He recovered from his illness, but he never forgot \nthe lesson: The boyars were out to destroy hirn. And indeed in the years to \ncorne, many of the most powerful of them defected to Russia's main ene­\nmies, Poland and Lithuania, where they plotted their return and the over­\nthrow of the czar. Even one of Ivan's dosest friends, Prince Andrey \nKurbski, suddenly turned against hirn, defecting to Lithuania in 1564, and \nbecoming the strongest of Ivan's enemies. \nWhen Kurbski began raising troops for an invasion, the royal dynasty \nseerned suddenly more precarious than ever. With emigre nobles foment­\ning invasion from the west, Tartars bearing down from the east, and the bo­\nyars stirring up trouble within the country, Russia's vast size made it a \nnightmare to defend. In whatever direction Ivan struck, he would leave \nhirnself vulnerable on the other side. Only if he had absolute power could \nhe deal with this many-headed Hydra. And he had no such power. \nIvan brooded until the morning of December 3, 1564, when the citi­\nzens of Moscow awoke to a strange sight. Hundreds of sleds filled the \nsquare before the Kremlin, loaded with the czar's treasures and with provi­\nsions for the entire court. They watched in disbelief as the czar and his \ncourt boarded the sleds and left town. Without explaining why, he estab­\nlished hirnself in a village south of Moscow. For an entire month a kind of \nterror gripped the capital, for the Muscovites feared that Ivan had aban­\ndoned them to the bloodthirsty boyars. Shops closed up and riotous mobs \ngathered daily. Finally, on January 3 of 1565, a letter arrived from the czar, \nexplaining that he could no longer bear the boyars' betrayals and had de­\ncided to abdicate once and for all. \nRead aloud in public, the letter had a startling effect: Merchants and \ncommoners blamed the boyars for Ivan's decision, and took to the streets, \nterrifying the nobility with their fury. Soon a group of delegates represent­\ning the church, the princes, and the people made the joumey to Ivan's vil­\nlage, and begged the czar, in the name of the holy land of Russia, to return \nto the throne. Ivan listened but would not change his mind. After days of \nhearing their pleas, however, he offered his subjects a choice: Either they \ngrant hirn absolute powers to govern as he pleased, with no interference \nfrorn the boyars, or they find a new leader. \nFaced with a choice between civil war and the acceptance of despotie \npower, almost every sector of Russian society \"opted\" for a strong czar, \ncalling for Ivan's return to Moscow and the restoration oflaw and order. In The German Chancel­\nlor Bismarck. enraged \nat the constant criti­\ncisms from Rudolf \nVirchow (the German \npathologist ami liberal \npolitician ), had his \nseconds call upon the \nscientist to chal/enge \nhim to a duel. \"As the \nchallenged party, I have \nthe choice of weapons, \" \nsaid Virchow, \"and I \nchoose these.\" He held \naloft two large and \napparently identical \nsausages. \"One of \nthese,\" he went on, \"is \ninfected with deadly \ngerms; the other is \nperfectly sound. Let \nHis Excellency decide \nwhich one he wishes to \neat. and I will eat the \nother.\" Almost immedi­\nately the message came \nback that the chancel­\nlor had decided to \ncancel the duel. \nTHE L1TTLE, BROWN \nBOOK OF ANECDOTFS, \nCLiFTON FADIMAN, RD., \n1985 \nLAW 31 255 \n'('HE LlAR \nOnce upon a time there \nwas a king of Armenia, \nwho, being of a curious \nturn of mind and in \nneed ofsome new \ndiversion, sent his \nheralds throughout the \nland to make \nthe following \nproc!amation: \n\"Hear this!

Even if Ivall came out of such a war on top, the country would be dev­\nastated and its divisions would be stronger than ever. His weapon of choice \nin the past had been to make a bold, offensive move. Now, however, that \nkind of move would turn against him-the more boldly he confronted his \nenemies, the worse the reactions he would spark \nThe main weakness of a show of force is that it stirs up resentment and \neventually leads to a response that eats at your authority_ Ivan, immensely \ncreative in the use of power, saw clearly that the only path to the kind of \nvictory he wanted was a false withdrawal. He would not force the country \nover to his position, he would give it \"options\": either his abdication, and \ncertain anarchy, or his accession to absolute power. To back up his move, \nhe made it clear that he preferred to abdicate: \"Call my bluff,\" he said, \n\"and watch what happens.\" No one called his bluff. By withdrawing for just \na month, he showed the country a glimpse of the nightmares that would \nfollow his abdication-Tartar invasions, civil war, ruin. (All of these did \neventually come to pass after Ivan's death, in the infamous \"Time of the \nTroubles.\") \nWithdrawal and disappearance are classic ways of controlling the op­\ntions. You give people a sense ofhow things will fall apart without you, and \nyou offer them a \"choice\": I stay away and you suffer the consequences, or \nI return under circumstanc es that I dictate. In this method of controlling \npeople's options, they choose the option that gives you power because the \nalternative is just too unpleasant. You force their hand, but indirectly : They \nseem to have a choice. Whenever people feel they have a choice, they walk \ninto your trap that much more easily. \nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 11 \nAs a seventeenth-century French courtesan, Ninon de Lenclos found that \nher life had certain pleasures. Her lovers came from royalty and aristoc­\nracy, and they paid her well, entertained her with their wit and intellect, \nsatisfied her rather demanding sensual needs, and treated her almost as an \nequal. Such a life was infinitely preferable to marriage. In 1643, however, \nNinon's mother died suddenly, leaving her, at the age of twenty-three, to­\ntally alone in the world-no family, no dowry, nothing to fall back upon. A \nkind of panic overtook her and she entered a convent, turning her back on \nher illustrious lovers. A year later she left the convent and moved to Lyons. \nWhen she finally reappeared in Paris, in 1648, lovers and suitors flocked to \nher dOOf in greater numbers than ever before, for she was the wittiest and \nmost spirited courtesan of the time and her presence had been greatly \nmissed. \nNinon's foHowers quickly discovered, however, that she had changed \nher old way of doing things, and had set up a new system of options. The \ndukes, seigneurs, and princes who wanted to pay for her serv ices could \ncont inue to do so, but they were no longer in control-she would sleep \nwith them when she wante d, according to her whim. All their money \nbought them was a possi bility. If it was her pleasure to sleep with them only \nonee a month, so be it. \nThose who did not want to be what Ninon called a payeur could join \nthe large and growing group of men she caHed her martyr.f-men who vis­\nited her apartment principally for her friendship, her biting wit, her lute­\nplaying, and the company of the most vibrant minds of the period, \nincluding Moliere, La Rochef oucauld, and Saint-Evremond. The martyrs, \ntoo, however, enterta ined a poss ibility : She would regularly select from \nthem a favori, a man who would become her lover without having to pay, \nand to whom she would aban don herself completely for as long as she so \ndesi red-a week, a few mont hs, rarely longer. A payeur could not become a \nfovori, but a martyr had no guarantee of becoming one, and indeed could \nremain disappointed for an entire lifetime. The poet Charleval, for exam­\npIe, never enjoyed Ninon's favors, but never stopped coming to visit -he \ndid not want to do without her compa ny. \nAs word of this system reached polite French society, Ninon became \nthe object of intense host ility. Her reversal of the position of the courtesan \nscanda lized the queen mother and her court. Much to their horror, how­\never, it did not dis courage her male suitors- indeed it only increased their \nnumbers and intensified their desire. It became an honor to be a payeur, \nhelping Ninon to maintain her lifestyle and her glittering salon, accompa­\nnying her sometime s to the theater, and sleeping with her when she chose. \nEven more distingui shed were the martyrs, enjoying her compa ny without \npaying for it and maintaining the hope, however remote, of some day be­\ncoming her favori. That pos sibility spurred on many a young nobleman, as \nword spread that none among the courtesans eould surpass Ninon in the \nart of love. And so the married and the sing le, the old and the young, en­\ntered her web and chose one of the two options presented to them, both of \nwhich amply satisfied her. \nInterpretation \nThe life of the courtesan entailed the pos sibility of apower that was denied \na marri ed woman, but it also had obvious perils. The man who paid for the \ncourte san's serv ices in essence owned her, determining when he could pos­\nsess her and when, later on, he would abandon her. As she grew older, her \noptions narrowed, as fewer men chose her. To avoid a life of poverty she \nhad to amass her fortune while she was young. The courte sa n's legendary \ngreed, then, reflected a practical neces sity, yet also lessened her aHure, \nsinee the illusion of being desired is important to men, who are often alien-dered. \"Surely you \nremember?

Eil., \n1985 \n258 LAW 31 ated if their partner is too interested in their money. As the courtesan aged, \nthen, she faced a most difficult fate. \nNinon de Lenclos had a horror of any kind of dependence. She early \non tasted a kind of equality with her lovers, and she would not settle into a \nsystem that left her such distasteful options. Strangely enough, the system \nshe devised in its place seemed to satisfy her suitors as much as it did her. \nThe payeurs may have had to pay, but the fact that Ninon would only sleep \nwith them when she wanted to gave them a thrill unavailable with every \nother courtesan : She was yielding out of her own desire. The martyrs' \navoidance of the taint of having to pay gave them a sense of superiority; as \nmembers of Ninon's fraternity of admirers, they also might some day expe­\nrience the ultimate pleasure of being her favori. Finally, Ninon did not \nforce her suitors into either category. They could \"choose\" which side they \npreferred-a freedom that left them a vestige of masculine pride. \nSuch is the power of giving people a choice, or rather the illusion of \none, for they are playing with cards you have dealt them. Where the alter­\nnatives set up by Ivan the Terrible involved a certain risk-one option \nwould have led to his losing his power-Ninon created a situation in which \nevery option redounded to her favor. From the payeurs she received the \nmoney she needed to run her salon. And from the martyrs she gained the \nultimate in power: She could surround herself with a bevy of admirers, a \nharem from which to choose her lovers. \nThe system, though, depended on one critical factor: the possibility, \nhowever remote, that a martyr could become a favori. The illusion that \nriches, glory, or sensual satisfaction may someday fall into your victim's lap \nis an irresistible carrot to include in your list of choices. That hope, how­\never slim, will make men accept the most ridicul ous situations, because it \nleaves them the all-important option of a dream. The illusion of choice, \nmarried to the possibility of future good fortune, will lure the most stub­\nborn sucker into your glittering web. \nKEYS TO POWER \nWords like \"freedom,\" \"options,\" and \"choice\" evoke apower of possibility \nfar beyond the reality of the benefits they entail. When examined closely, \nthe choices we have-in the market place, in elections, in our jobs-tend to \nhave noticeable limitations: They are often a matter of a choice simply be­\ntween A and B, with the rest of the alphabet out of the pieture. Yet as long \nas the faintest mirage of choice flickers on, we rarely focus on the missing \noptions. We \"choose\" to believe that the game is fair, and that we have our \nfreedom. We prefer not to think too much about the depth of our liberty to \nchoose. \nThis unwillingn ess to probe the smallness of our choices sterns from \nthe fact that too much freedom creates a kind of anxiety. The phrase \"un­\nlimited options\" sounds infinitely promising, but unlimited options would \nactually paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose. Our limited range of \nchoices comforts uso \nThis supplie s the clever and cunning with enormous opportunities for \ndeception. For people who are choosing between alternativ es find it hard \nto believe they are being manipulated or deceived; they cannot see that \nyou are allowing them a small amount of free will in exchange for a much \nmore powerful imposition of your own will. Setting up a narrow range of \nchoices, then, should always be a part of your deceptions. There is a say­\ning: If you can get the bird to walk into the cage on its own, it will sing that \nmuch more prettily. \nThe following are among the most common forms of \"controlling the \noptions\": \nColor the Choices. This was a favored technique of Henry Kissinger. As \nPresident Richard Nixon's secretary of state, Kissinger considered hirnself \nbetter informed than his boss, and believed that in most situations he could \nmake the best decision on his own. But if he tried to determine policy, he \nwould offend or perhaps enrage a notoriously insecure man. So Kissinger \nwould propose three or four choices of action for each situation, and would \npresent them in such a way that the one he preferred always seemed the \nbest solution compared to the others. Time after time, Nixon fell for the \nbait, never suspecting that he was moving where Kissinger pushed hirn. \nThis is an excellent device to use on the insecure master. \nForce the Resister . One of the main problems faced by Dr. Milton H. Er­\nickson, a pioneer of hypnosis therapy in the 1950s, was the relapse. His pa­\ntients might seem to be recovering rapidly, but their apparent suscept ibility \nto the therapy masked a deep resistance: They would soon relapse into old \nhabits, blame the doctor, and stop coming to see hirn. To avoid this, Erick­\nson began ordering some patients to have a relapse, to make themselves feel \nas bad as when they first came in-to go back to square one. Faced with \nthis option, the patients would usually \"choose\" to avoid the relapse­\nwhich, of course, was what Ericks on really wanted. \nThis is a good technique to use on children and other willful people \nwho enjoy doing the opposite of what you ask them to: Push them to \n\"choose\" what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite. \nAlter the Playing Field. In the 1860s, John D. Rockefeller set out to cre­\nate an oil monopoly. If he tried to buy up the smaller oil companies they \nwould figure out what he was doing and fight back. Instead, he began se­\ncretly buying up the railway companies that transported the oil. When he \nthen attempted to take over a particular company, and met with resistance, \nhe reminded them of their dependence on the rails. Refusing them ship­\nping, or simply raising their fees, could ruin their business. Rockefeller al­\ntered the playing field so that the only options the small oil producers had \nwere the ones he gave them. \nIn this tactic your opponents know their hand is being forced, but it \ndoesn't matter. The technique is effective against those who resist at all \ncosts. \nLAW 31 259 \n260 LAW 31 The Shrinking Options. The late-nineteent h-century art dealer Am­\nbroise Vollard perfected this technique. \nCustomers would come to Vollard's shop to see some Cezannes. He \nwould show three paintings, neglect to mention a price, and pretend to \ndoze off. The visitors would have to leave without deciding. They would \nusually come back the next day to see the paintings again, but this time \nVollard would pull out less interesting works, pretending he thought they \nwere the same ones. The baffled customers would look at the new offer­\nings, leave to think them over, and return yet again. Once again the same \nthing would happen: Vollard would show paintings of lesser quality still. Fi­\nnally the buyers would realize they had better grab what he was showing \nthem, because tomorrow they would have to settle far something worse, \nperhaps at even higher prices. \nA variation on this technique is to raise the price every time the buyer \nhesitates and another day goes by. This is an excellent negotiating ploy to \nuse on the chronically indecisive, who will fall for the idea that they are get­\nting a better deal today than if they wait till tomorrow. \nThe We ak Man on the Precip ice. The weak are the easiest to maneuver \nby controlling their options. Cardinal de Retz, the great seventeenth-cen­\ntury provocateur, served as an unofficial assistant to the Duke of Orleans, \nwho was notoriously indecisive. It was a constant struggle to convince the \nduke to take action-he would hem and haw, weigh the options, and wait \ntill the last moment, giving everyone around hirn an ulcer. But Retz discov­\nered a way to handle hirn: He would describe all sorts of dangers, exagger­\nating them as much as possible, until the duke saw a yawning abyss in \nevery direction except one: the one Retz was pushing hirn to take. \nThis tactic is similar to \"Color the Choices,\" but with the weak you \nhave to be more aggressive. Work on their emotions- use fear and terror \nto propel them into action. Try reason and they will always find a way to \nprocrastinate. \nBrothers in Crime. This is a classic con-artist technique: You attract YOUf \nvictims to same criminal scheme, creating a bond of blood and guilt be­\ntween you. They participate in your deception, commit a crime (or think \nthey do-see the story of Sam Geezil in Law 3), and are easily manipu­\nlated. Serge Stavisky, the great French con artist of the 1920s, so entangled \nthe government in his scams and swindles that the state did not dare to \nprosecute hirn, and \"chose\" to leave hirn alone. It is often wise to implicate \nin your deceptions the very person who can do you the most harm if you \nfail. Their involvement can be subtle--even a hint of their involvement \nwill narrow their options and buy their silence. \nThe Horns of a Dilemma. This idea was demonstrated by General \nWilliam Sherman's infamous march through Georgia during the American \nCivil War. Although the Confederates knew what direction Sherman was \nheading in, they never knew if he would attack from the left or the right, for \nhe divided his army into two wings--- and if the rebels retreated from one \nwing they found themselves facing the other. This is a classic triallawyer's \ntechnique: The lawyer leads the witnesses to decide between two possible \nexplanati ons of an event, both of which poke a hole in their story. They \nhave to answer the lawyer's questions, but whatever they say they hurt \nthemselves. The key to this move is to strike quick ly: Deny the victim the \ntime to think of an escape. As they wriggle between the horns of the \ndilemma, they dig their own grave. \nUndersta nd: In your struggles with your rivals, it will often be necessary \nfor you to hurt them. And if you are clearly the agent of their punishment, \nexpect a counte rattack-e xpect revenge. If, however, they seem to them­\nselves to be the agents of their own misfortune, they will submit quietly. \nWhen Ivan left Moscow for his rural village, the citizens asking hirn to re­\nturn agreed to his demand for absolute power. Over the years to come, \nthey resented hirn less for the terror he unleashed on the country, because, \nafter all, they had granted hirn his power themselves. This is why it is al­\nways good to allow your victims their choice of poison, and to cloak your \ninvolvement in providing it to them as far as possible. \nImage: The Horns of \nthe Bull. The bull \ninto the cor­\nhorns- not \nwhich you \nable to es­\npairofhorns \nwithin their backs you \nner with its \na single horn, \nmight be \ncape, but a \nthat trap you \nhold. Run right or run \nleft-either w a y y 0 u \nmove into their piercing \nends and are gored . \nAuthority: For the wounds and every other evil that men inflict upon them­\nselves spontaneously, and of their own choice, are in the long run less \npainful than those inflicted by others. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527) \nLAW 31 261 \n262 LAW 31 REVERSAL \nControlling the options has one main purpose: to disguise yourself as the \nagent of power and punishment. The tactic works best, then, for those \nwhose power is fragile, and who cannot operate too openly without incur­\nring suspicion, resentment, and anger. Even as a general rule, however, it is \nrarely wise to be seen as exerting power directly and forcefully, no matter \nhow secure or strong you are. 1t is usually more elegant and more effective \nto give people the illusion of choice. \nOn the other hand, by limiting other people's options you sometimes \nlimit your OWll. There are situations in which it is to your advantage to \nallow your rivals a large degree of freedom: As you watch them operate, \nyou give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather informati on, and plan \nyour deceptions. The nineteenth-century banker James Rothschild liked \nthis method: He feIt that if he tried to control his opponents' movements, \nhe lost the chance to observe their strategy and plan a more effective \ncourse. The more freedom he allowed them in the short term, the more \nforcefully he could act against them in the long run. \nLAW \n32 \nPLAY TO PE OPL E'S \nFANT ASIES \nJUDGMEN T \nThe truth is often avoided because it is ugly and un­\npleasant. Never appeal to truth and reality unless you \nare prepared for the anger that comes from disen­\nchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people \nwho can manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are \nlike oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is \ngreat power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses. \n263 \nTIIE Fl \\F,IL\\ L OF \n'1'11 1': LlO'\\ I':�S \nThe !ion having \nsudden/y lost his \nqueen, every one \nhastened (0 show alle­\ngiance to the monarch, \nby offering conso/a­\ntirm, These comp/i­\nments, a/as, served but \nto increase the \nwidower' s affliction. \nDue nmice was given \nthroughout the king­\ndom that the funeral \nwou/d be performed at \na certain time and \nplace; the lion:, officers \nwere ordered to be in \nallendance, to regulate \nthe ceremony, and \nplace the company \naccording to their \nrespeclive rank. \nOne may weil judge no \none absented hirnself \nThe monarch gave way \nto his grief, and the \nwhole cave, !ions hav­\ning no other temples, \nresounded with his \ncries.

In the Middle Ages and High Re­\nnaissance, its virtual monopoly on trade to the east made it the wealthiest \ncity in Europe. Under a beneficent republican government, Venetians en­\njoyed liberties that few other Italians had ever known. Yet in the sixteenth \ncentury their fortunes suddenly change d. The opening of the New Wo rld \ntransf erred power to the Atlantic side of Europe-to the Spanish and Por­\ntugu ese, and later the Dutch and Engli sh. Venice could not compete eco­\nnomically and its empire gradually dwind led. The final blow was the \ndevastating loss of a prized Mediterranean poss ession, the island of \nCypr us, captured from Venice by the Turks in 1570. \nNow noble familie s went broke in Venice, and banks began to fold. A \nkind of gloom and depression settled over the citizens. They had known a \nglittering past-had either lived through it or heard stories about it frorn \ntheir elders. The closeness of the glory years was humiliating. The Vene­\ntians half believed that the goddess Fortune was only playing a joke on \nthem, and that the old days would soon return . For the time being, though, \nwhat could they do? \nIn 1589 rumors began to swirl around Venice of the arrival not far \naway of a mysterious man called \"11 Bragadin o,\" a master of alchemy, a \nman who had won incredible wealth through his ability, it was said, to mul­\ntiply gold through the use of a secret substa nce. The rumor spread quickly \nbecause a few years earlier, a Venetian nobleman passing through Poland \nhad heard a leamed man prophesy that Venice would recover her past \nglory and power if she could find a man who understood the alchemic art \nof manufacturing gold. And so, as word reached Venice of the gold this \nBragadino possess ed-he clinked gold coins continuously in his hands , \nand golden objects filled his palace-s ome began to dream : Through hirn, \ntheir city would prosper again. \nMembers of Venice's most important noble families accord ingly went \ntogether to Brescia, where Bragadino li ved. They toured his palace and \nwatched in awe as he demonst rated his gold-making abiliti es, taking a \npinch of seem ingly wort hless minerals and transforming it into several \nounc es of gold dust. The Venetian senate prepared to debate the idea of ex­\ntending an official invitation to Bragadino to stay in Venice at the city's ex­\npense, when word suddenly reached them that they were compet ing with \nthe Duke of Mantua for bis serv ices. They heard of a mag nificent party in \nBragadin o's palace for the duke, featuring garments with golden butto ns, \ngold watc hes, gold plates, and on and on. Wo rried they might lose Bra­\ngadino to Mantua, the senate voted almost unanimously to invite hirn to \nVenice, promising him the mountain of money he would need to continue \nliving in his luxurious style-but only if he came right away. \nLate that year the mysterious Bragadino arrived in Venice. With his \npiercing dark eyes under thick brows, and the two enormous black mastiffs \nthat accompanied him everyw here, he was forbidding and impressive. He \ntook up residence in a sumptuous palace on the island of the Giudecca, \nwith the republic funding his banquets, his expensive clothes, and all his \nother whims. A kind of alchemy fever spread through Venice. On street \ncorners, hawkers would sell coal, distilling apparat us, bellows, how-to \nbooks on the subject. Everyone began to practice alchemy-everyone ex­\ncept Bragadino. \nThe alchemist seemed to be in no hurry to begin manufacturing the \ngold that would save Venice from ruin. Strangely enough this only in­\ncreased his popularity and following ; people thronged from all over Eu­\nrope, even Asia, to meet this remarkable man. Months went by, with gifts \npouring in to Bragadino from all sides. Still he gave no sign of the miracle \nthat the Venetians confidently expected hirn to produce. Eventually the cit­\nizens began to grow impatient, wondering if he would wait forever. At first \nthe senators warned them not to hurry hirn-he was a capricious devil, \nwho needed to be cajoled. Finally, though, the nobility began to wonder \ntoo, and the senate came under pressure to showareturn on the city's bal­\nlooning investment. \nBragadino had only scorn for the doubters, but he responded to them. \nHe had, he said, already deposited in the city's mint the mysterious sub­\nstance with which he multiplied gold. He could use this substance up all at \nonce, and produce double the gold, but the more slowly the process took \nplace, the more it would yield. If left alone for seven years, sealed in a cas­\nket, the substance would multiply the gold in the mint thirty times over. \nMost of the senators agreed to wait to reap the gold mine Bragadino \npromised. Others, however, were angry: seven more years of this man liv­\ning royally at the public trough ! And many of the common citizens of \nVenice echoed these sentiments. Finally the alchemist's enemies demanded \nhe produce a proof of his skills: a substantial amount of gold, and soon. \nLofty, apparently devoted to his art, Bragadino responded that Venice, \nin its impatience, had betrayed hirn, and would therefore lose his services. \nHe left town, going first to nearby Padua, then, in 1590, to Munich, at the \ninvitation of the Duke of Bavaria, who, like the entire city of Venice, had \nknown great wealth but had fallen into bankruptcy through his own profli­\ngacy, and hoped to regain his fortune through the famous alchemist's ser­\nvices. And so Bragadino resumed the comfort able arrangement he had \nknown in Venice, and the same pattern repeated itself. \nInterpretati on \nThe young Cypriot Mamugna had lived in Venice for several years before \nreincarnating hirnself as the alchemist Bragadino. He saw how gloom had \nsettled on the city, how everyone was hoping for a redemption from some \nindefinite source. While other charlatans mastered everyday cons based on \nsleight of hand, Mamugna mastered human nature. With Venice as his tar­\nget from the start, he traveled abroad, made some money through his \nalchemy scams, and then returned to Italy, setting up shop in Brescia. \nThere he created areputation that he knew would spread to Venice. From \na distance, in fact, his aura of power would be all the more impressive. \nAt first Mamugna did not use vulgar demonstrations to convince peo-formerly strangled his \nwife and son. A courtier \nthought fit to inform the \nbereaved monarch, and \neven affirmed that he \nhad seen the stag laugh. \nThe rage of a king, says \nSolomon, is terrible, \nand especially that of \na lion-king. \"Pitiful \nforesterf\" he exclaimed, \n\"darest thou laugh \nwhen all around are \ndissolved in tears?

And these established the cyde that kept him going: His ob­\nvious wealth confirmed his reputation as an alchemist, so that patrons like \nthe Duke of Mantua gave him money, which allowed him to live in wealth, \nwhich reinforced his reputation as an alchemist, and so on. Only once this \nreputation was established, and dukes and senators were fighting over hirn, \ndid he resort to the trifling necessity of a demonstration. By then, however, \npeople were easy to deceive: They wanted to believe. The Venetian sena­\ntors who watched him multiply gold wanted to believe so badly that they \nfailed to notice the glass pipe up his sleeve, from which he slipped gold \ndust into his pinches of minerals. Brilliant and capricious, he was the al­\nchemist of their fantasies-and once he had created an aura like this, no \none noticed his simple deceptions. \nSuch is the power of the fantasies that take root in us, especially in \ntimes of scarcity and dedine. People rarely believe that their problems \narise from their own misdeeds and stupidity. Someone or something out \nthere is to blarne-the other, the world, the gods-and so salvation comes \nfrom the outside as weH. Had Bragadino arrived in Venice armed with a \ndetailed analysis of the reasons behind the city's economic dedine, and of \nthe hard-nosed steps that it could take to turn things around, he would \nhave been scomed. The reality was too ugly and the solution too painful­\nmostly the kind of hard work that the citizens' ancestors had mustered to \ncreate an empire. Fantasy, on the other hand-in this case the romance of \nalchemy-was easy to understand and infinitely more palatable. \nTo gain power, you must be a source of pleasure for those around \nyou-and pleasure comes from playing to people's fantasies. Never \npromise a gradual improvement through hard work; rather, promise the \nmo on, the great and sudden transformation, the pot of gold. \nNo man need despair of gaining converts to the most extravag ant \nhypothesis who has art enough to represent it in favorable colors, \nDavid Hume, 1711-1776 \nKEYS TO POWER \nFantasy can never operate alone. It requires the backdrop of the humdrum \nand the mundane. It is the oppressiveness of reality that allows fantasy to \ntake root and bloom. In sixteenth-century Venice, the reality was one of de­\ndine and loss of prestige. The corresponding fantasy described a sudden \nrecovery of past glories through the miracle of alchemy. While the reality \nonly got worse, the Venetians inhabited a happy dream world in which \ntheir city restored its fabulous wealth and power ovemight, tuming dust \ninto gold. \nThe person who can spin a fantasy out of an oppressive reality has ac­\ncess to untold power. As you search for the fantasy that will take hold of the \nmasses, then, keep your eye on the banal truths that weigh heavily on us \nall. Never be distracted by people's glamorous portraits of themselves and \ntheir lives; search and dig far what really imprisons them. Once you find \nthat, you have the magical key that will put great power in your hands. \nAlthough times and people change, let us examine a few of the oppres­\nsive realities that endure, and the opportunities for power they provide: \nTM Reality: Change is slow and gradual. It requires hard work, a bit o[ luck, a [air \namount o[selfsacrifice, and a lot p[patience. \nThe Fantasy: A sudden transformation will bring a total change in one's fortunes, \nbypassing work, luck, selfsacrifice, and time in one [antastic stroke. \nThis is of course the fantasy par excellence of the charlatans who \nprowl among us to this day, and was the key to Bragadino's success. \nPromise a great and total change-from poor to rich, sickness to health, \nmisery to ecstasy-and you will have followers. \nHow did the great sixteenth -century German quack Leonhard \nThumeisser become the court physician for the Elector of Brandenburg \nwithout ever studying medicine? Instead of offering amputations, leeches, \nand foul-tasting purgatives (the medicaments of the time), Thumeisser of­\nfered sweet-tasting elixirs and promised instant recovery. Fashionable \ncourtiers especially wanted his solution of \"drinkable gold,\" which cost a \nfortune. If so me inexplicable illness assailed you, Thumeisser would con­\nsult a horoscope and prescribe a talisman. Who could resist such a \nfantasy-health and well-being without sacrifice and pain! \nThe Reality: The social realm has hard-set codes and boundaries. We understand \nthese limits and know that we have to move within the same [amiliar circles, day in \nand day out. \nThe Fantasy: We can enter a totally new world with different codes and the promise \no[ adventure. \nIn the early 1700s, all London was abuzz with talk of a mysterious \nstranger, a young man named George Psalmanazar. He had arrived from \nwhat was to most Englishmen a fantastical land: the island of Formosa \n(now Taiwan), off the coast of China. Oxford University engaged \nPsalmanazar to teach the island's language ; a few years later he translated \nthe Bible into Formosan, then wrote a book-an immediate best-seIler-on \nFormosa's history and geography. English royalty wined and dined the \nyoung man, and everywhere he went he entertained his hosts with won­\ndrous stories of his homeland, and its bizarre customs. \nAfter Psalmanazar died, however, his will revealed that he was in fact \nmerely a Frenchman with a rich imaginati on. Everything he had said about \nFormosa-its alphabet, its language, its literature, its entire culture-he had \ninvented. He had built on the English publ ic's ignorance of the place to \nconcoct an elaborate story that fulfilled their desire for the exotic and \nLAW 32 267 \n268 LAW 32 strange. British culture's rigid control of people's dangerous dreams gave \nhirn the perfect opportunity to exploit their fantasy. \nThe fantasy of the exotic, of course, can also skirt the sexual. It must \nnot come too elose, though, for the physical hinders the power of fantasy; it \ncan be seen, grasped, and then tired of-the fate of most courtesans. The \nbodily charms of the mistress only whet the master's appetite for more and \ndifferent pleasures, a new beauty to adore. To bring power, fantasy must re­\nmain to some degree unrealized, literally unreal. The dancer Mata Hari, \nfor instance, who rose to public prominence in Paris before World War I, \nhad quite ordinary looks. Her power came from the fantasy she created of \nbeing strange 'and exotic, unknowable and indedphera ble, The taboo she \nworked with was less sex itself than the breaking of sodal codes. \nAnother form of the fantasy of the exotic is simply the hope for relief \nfrom boredom. Con artists love to play on the oppressiveness of the work­\ning world, its lack of adventure. Their cons might involve, say, the recov­\nery of lost Spanish treasure, with the possible partidpation of an alluring \nMexican seiiorita and a connection to the president of a South American \ncountry-anything offering release from the humdrum. \nThe Reality: Society is frag;mented and foll of conflict. \nThe Fantasy: People can come together in a mystical union ofsouls. \nIn the 1920s the con man Oscar Hartzell made a quick fortune out of \nthe age-old Sir Frands Drake swindle-basically promising any sucker who \nhappened to be surnamed \"Drake\" a substantial share of the long-lost \n\"Drake treasure,\" to which Hartzell had access. Thousands across the Mid­\nwest fell for the scam, which Hartzell eleverly turned into a crusade against \nthe government and everyone else who was trying to keep the Drake for­\ntune out of the rightful hands of its heirs. There developed a mystical union \nof the oppressed Drakes, with emotional rallies and meetings . Promise such \na union and you can gain much power, but it is a dangerous power that can \neasily turn against you. This is a fantasy for demagogues to play on. \nThe Reality: Death. The dead cannot be brought back, the past cannot be changed. \nThe Fantasy: A sudden reversal ofthis intolerable fact. \nThis con has many variations, but requires great skill and subtlety. \nThe beauty and importance of the art of Vermeer have long been rec­\nognized, but his paintings are small in number, and are extremely rare. In \nthe 1930s, though, Vermeers began to appear on the art market. Experts \nwere called on to verify them, and pronounced them real. Pos session of \nthese new Vermeers would crown a collector's career. It was like the resur­\nrection of Lazarus: In a strange way, Vermeer had been brought back to \nlife. The past had been changed. \nOnly later did it come out that the new Vermeers were the work of a \nmiddle-aged Dutch forger named Han van Meegeren. And he had chosen \nVermeer for his scam because he understood fantasy: The paintings would \nseem real precisely because the public, and the experts as weIl, so desper­\nately wanted to believe they were. \nRemember: The key to fantasy is distance. The distant has allure and \npromise, seems simple and problem free. What you are offering, then, \nshould be ungraspabl e. Never let it become oppressively familiar; it is the \nmirage in the distance, withdrawing as the sucker approac hes. Never be \ntoo direct in describing the fantasy-keep it vague. As a forger of fantasies, \nlet your victim come elose enough to see and be tempted, but keep hirn far \naway enough that he stays dreaming and desiring. \nImage: The \nMoon. Unattain able, \nalways changing shape, \ndisappearing and reappear­\ning. We look at it, imagine, \nwonder, and pine-never fa­\nmiliar, continuous provoker \nof dream s. Do not offer \nthe obvious. Promise \nthe moon. \nAuthority : A lie is an allurement, a fabrication, that can be embell­\nished into a fantasy. It can be elothed in the raiments of a mystic \nconceptio n. Truth is cold, sober fact, not so comfortable to absorb. \nA lie is more palatable. The most detested person in the world is \nthe one who always teIls the truth, who never romances. . . . \nI found it far more interesting and profitable to romance than to \ntell the truth. (Joseph Weil, a.k.a. \"The Yellow Kid,\" 1875-1976) \nLAW 32 269 \n270 LAW 32 REVERSAL \nIf there is power in tapping into the fantas ies of the masses, there is also \ndanger. Fantasy usually contains an element of play-the public half real­\nizes it is being duped, but it keeps the dream alive anyway, relishing the en­\ntertainment and the temporary diversion from the every day that you are \nproviding. So keep it light -never come too elose to the place where you \nare actually expected to produce results . That place may prove extremely \nhazardous. \nAfter Bragadino estab lished hirnself in Munieh, he found that the \nsober-minded Bavarians had far less faith in alchemy than the tempera­\nmental Venetians. Only the duke really believed in it, for he needed it des­\nperately to rescue him from the hopeless mess he was in. As Bragadino \nplayed his familiar waiting gam e, accepting gifts and expecting patience, \nthe public grew angry. Money was being spent and was yielding no results. \nIn 1592 the Bavarians dema nded justice, and eventually Bragadino found \nhirnself swinging from the gallo ws. As before, he had promised and had \nnot delivered, but this time he had mis judged the forbearance of his hosts, \nand his inability to fulfill their fantasy proved fatal. \nOne last thing: Never make the mistake of imagining that fantasy is al­\nways fant astical. It certa inly contrasts with reality, but reality itself is some­\ntimes so theatrical and styli zed that fantasy be comes ad esire for simple \nthings. The image Abraham Lincoln created of hirnself , for example, as a \nhomespun country lawyer with a beard, made him the common man's \npresident. \nP. T. Barn um created a successful act with Tom Thumb, a dwarf who \ndressed up as fam ous leaders of the past, such as Napoleon, and lam­\npooned them wickedly. The show delighted everyone, right up to Queen \nVictoria, by appealing to the fan tasy of the time: Enough of the vain­\nglorious rulers of history, the common man knows best. Tom Thumb re­\nversed the familiar pattern of fantasy in which the strange and unknown \nbe comes the ideal. But the act still obeyed the Law, for underl ying it \nwas the fantasy that the simple man is without problems, and is happier \nthan the powerful and the rich. \nBoth Lincoln and Tom Thumb played the commoner but carefully \nmaintained their distanc e. Should you play with such a fantasy, you too \nmust carefully cultivate distance and not allow your \"common\" persona to \nbecome too familiar or it will not project as fantasy. \nLAW \n33 \nDISC OVER EA CH \nMA N'S TH UMBS CR EW \nJUDGME NT \nEveryone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall.

We \nwould like no thing more than to be left to do things our own way. Con­\nstantly butting up against these resistances will cost you a lot of energy. \nOne of the most important things to realize about people, though, is that \nthey all have a weakness, some part of their psychological arrn or that will \nnot resist, that will bend to your will if you find it and push on it. Some peo­\npIe wear their weaknesses openly, others disguise them. Those who dis­\nguise them are often the ones most effectively undone through that one \nchink in their arrn or. \nIn planning YOUf assault, keep these principl es in mi nd: \nPay Attention to Gestures and Unconscious Signals. As Sigmund \nFreud remarked, \"No mortal can keep a secret. If his lips are silent, he chat­\nters with his fingertip s; betra yal oozes out of hirn at every pore.\" This is a \ncritical concept in the search for a person's weakness -it is revealed by \nseemingly unimp ortant ge stures and passing words. \nThe key is not only what you look for but where and how you look. \nEveryday conversation suppli es the richest mine of weaknesses, so train \nyourself to listen. Start by always seeming interested-the appearance of a \nsympathetic ear will SpUf anyone to talk. A clever trick, often used by the \nnineteenth-century French state sman Talleyrand, is to appear to open up to \nthe other person, to share a secret with them. It can be completely made \nup, or it can be real but of no great importance to you-the impo rtant \nthing is that it should seern to come from the heart. This will usually elicit a \nresponse that is not only as frank as Y0ufS but more genuine--a response \nthat reveals a weakness. \nIf you suspect that someone has a particular soft spot, probe for it indi­\nrectly. If, for instanc e, you sense that a man has a need to be loved, openly \nflatter him. If he laps up Y0uf compliments, no matter how obvious, you \nare on the right track. Train Y0uf eye for details-how someone tips a \nwaiter, what delights aperson, the hidden messages in clothes. Find peo­\nple's idols, the things they worship and will do anything to get-perhaps \nyou can be the supplier of their fanta sies. Rememb er: Since we all try to \nhide Ouf weakn esses, there is little to be learned from Ouf conscious beha v­\nior. What oozes out in the little things outside Ouf conscious control is what \nyou want to know. \nFind the Helpless Child. Most wea knesses begin in childhood, before \nthe self builds up compensa tory defen ses. Perhaps the child was pampered \nor indulged in a particular area, or perhaps a certain emotional need went \nunfulfi lled; as he or she grows older, the indulgence or the deficiency may \nbe buried but never disa ppears. Knowing about a childh ood need gives \nyou a powerful key to a person's weakn ess. \nOne sign of this weak ness is that when you touch on it the person will \noften act like a child, Be on the lookout, then, for any behavior that should \nhave been outgrown. If your victims or rivals went without something im­\nportant, such as parental support, when they were children, supply it, or its \nfacsimile. If they reveal a secret taste, a hidden indulgen ce, indulge it. In ei­\nther case they will be unable to resist you. \nLook for Cont rasts. An overt trait often conceals its opposite. People \nwho thump their chests are often big cowards; a prudish exterior may hide \na lascivious soul; the uptight are often screaming for advent ure; the shy are \ndying for attention. By probing beyond appeara nces, you will often find \npeople's weaknesses in the opposite of the qualities they reveal to you. \nFind the We ak Link. Sometimes in your search for weaknesses it is not \nwhat but who that matters. In today's versions of the court, there is often \nsomeone behind the scenes who has a great deal of power, a tremendous \ninfluence over the person superficially on top. These behind-the-scenes \npowerbrokers are the group's weak link: Win their favor and you indirectly \ninfluence the king. Altematively, even in a group of people acting with the \nappearance of one will-as when a group und er attack closes ranks to resist \nan outsider-there is always a weak link in the chain. Find the one person \nwho will bend under pressure. \nFill the Void. The two main emotional voids to fill are insecurity and un­\nhappiness. The insecure are suckers for any kind of social validation; as for \nthe chron ically unhappy, look for the roots of their unhappiness. The inse-­\neure and the unhappy are the people least able to disguise their weak­\nnesses. The ability to fill their emotional voids is a great source of power, \nand an indefinitely prolongable one. \nFeed on Uncontrolla ble Emotions. The uncontrollable emotion can be \na paranoid fear-a fear disproportionate to the situation-or any base mo­\ntive such as lust, greed, vanity, or hatred. People in the grip of these emo­\ntions often cannot control themselves, and you can do the controlling for \nthem. \nOBSER VANCES OF THE LAW \nObservance I \nIn 1615 the thirty-year-old bishop ofLU/;:on, later known as Cardinal Riche­\nHeu, gave a speech before representatives of the three estates of France­\nclergy, nobility, and commoners. Richelieu had been chosen to serve as \nthe mouthpiece for the clergy-an immense responsibility for a man still \nyoung and not particularly well known. On all of the important issues of \nthe day, the speech followed the Church line. But near the end of it Riche­\nHeu did something that had nothing to do with the Church and everything \nto do with his career. He tumed to the throne of the fifteen-year-old King \nLouis XIII, and to the Queen Mother Marie de' Medicis, who sat beside Then what did his dear \nfriend do?

In­\nstead, however, he looked directly at and only at the queen mother. Indeed \nhis speech ended in long and fulsome praise of her, praise so glowing that it \nactually offended some in the Church . But the smile on the queen's face as \nshe lapped up Richelieu' s compliments was unforgetta ble. \nA year later the queen mother appointed Richelieu secretary of state \nfor foreign affa irs, an incredible coup for the young bishop. He had now \nente red the inner cirele of power, and he studied the workings of the court \nas if it were the machinery of a watch. An Itali an, Concino Concini, was \nthe queen mother 's favorite, or rather her lover, a role that made hirn per­\nhaps the most powerful man in France. Concini was vain and foppish, and \nRichelieu played him perfect ly-atte nding to him as if he were the king. \nWithin months Richelieu had become one of Concini's favorit es. But \nsomething happ ened in 1617 that turned everything upside down: the \nyoung king, who up until then had shown every sign of being an idiot, had \nConcini mur dered and his most important associates imp risoned, In so \ndoing Louis took command of the country with one blow, sweeping the \nqueen mother aside. \nHad Richelieu played it wrong? He had been elose to both Concini \nand Marie de Medicis, whose adv isers and ministers were now all out of \nfavor, some even arrested. The queen mother herself was shut up in the \nLouvre, a virtual prisoner. Richelieu wasted no time . If everyone was de­\nserting Marie de Medicis, he would stand by her. He knew Louis could not \nget rid of her, for the king was still very young, and had in any case always \nbeen inordinately attached to her. As Marie's only remaining powerful \nfriend, Richelieu filled the valuable function of liaison between the king \nand his mother. In return he received her protection, and was able to sur­\nvive the palace coup, even to thri ve. Over the next few years the queen \nmother grew still more dependent on hirn, and in 1622 she repaid hirn for \nhis loyalty: Through the inte rcession of her allies in Rome, Richelieu was \nelevated to the powerful rank of cardinal. \nBy 1623 King Louis was in trouble. He had no one he could trust to \nadvise hirn, and although he was now a young man instead of a boy, he re­\nmained childish in spirit, and affairs of state came hard to hirn. Now that he \nhad taken the throne, Marie was no longer the regent and theoretica lly had \nno power, but she still had her son's ear, and she kept telling him that \nRichelieu was his only possible savior. At first Louis would have none of \nit-he hate d the cardinal with a passion, only tolerating him out of love for \nMarie. In the end, however, isolate d in the court and crippled by his own \nindecisiven ess, he yielded to his mother and made Richelieu first his chief \ncouncilor and later prime minister. \nNow Richelieu no longer needed Marie de Medicis. He stopp ed visit­\ning and courting her, stopped listening to her opinions, even argued with \nher and opposed her wishes. Instead he concentrated on the king, making \nhimself indispensable to his new master. All the previous premiers, under­\nstanding the king's childis hness, had tried to keep him out of troubl e; the \nshrewd Richelieu played hirn differentl y, deliberately pushing hirn into \none ambitious project after another, such as a crusade against the \nHuguenots and finally an extended war with Spain. The immensity of \nthese projects only made the king more dependent on his powerful pre­\nmier, the only man able to keep order in the realm. And so, for the next \neighteen years, Richelieu, exploiting the king's weakne sses, govemed and \nmolded France according to his own vision, unifying the country and mak­\ning it a strong European power for centuries to come. \nInterpretat ion \nRichelieu saw everything as a military campaign, and no strategie move \nwas more important to hirn than discovering his enemy's weakne sses and \napplying pressure to them. As early as his speech in 1615, he was looking \nfor the weak link in the chain of power, and he saw that it was the queen \nmother. Not that Marie was obviously weak-she govemed both France \nand her son; but Richelieu saw that she was really an insecure woman who \nneeded constant masculine attention. He showered her with affection and \nrespect, even toadying up to her favorite, Concini . He knew the day would \ncome when the king would take over, but he also recognized that Louis \nloved his mother dearly and would always remain a child in relat ion to her. \nThe way to control Louis, then, was not by gaining his favor, which could \nchange ovemight, but by gaining sway over his mother, for whom his af­\nfection would never change . \nOnce Richelieu had the position he desired-prime minister-he dis­\ncarded the queen mother, moving on to the next weak link in the chain: \nthe king's own character. There was apart of hirn that would always be a \nhelpless child in need of higher authority. 1t was on the foundation of the \nking's weakne ss that Richelieu established his own power and farne. \nRemember: When entering the court, find the weak link. The person \nin control is often not the king or queen; it is someone behind the scenes­\nthe favorite, the husband or wife, even the court fool. This person may \nhave more weaknesses than the king hirnself, because his power depends \non all kinds of capricious factors outside his control. \nFinally, when dealing with helpless children who cannot make deci­\nsions, play on their weakne ss and push them into bold ventures. They will \nhave to depend on you even more, for you will become the adult figure \nwhom they rely on to get them out of scrapes and to safety. \nObservance II \nIn December of 1925, guests at the swanki est hotel in Palm Beach, Florida, \nwatched with interest as a mysterious man arrived in a Rolls-Royce driven \nby a J apanese chauffeur. Over the next few days they studied this hand­\nsame man, who walked with an elegant cane, received telegrams at all \nhours, and only engaged in the briefest of conversat ions. He was a count, \nthey heard, Count Victor Lustig, and he came from one of the wealthiest \nfamilies in Europe-but this was all they could find out. \n1magine their amazement, then, when Lustig one day walked up to \none of the least distinguished guests in the hotel, a Mr. Herman Loller, '1'111' LlTTI F TIII\\CS \nCOI 'Y/, \nAs time went on I came \nto laok for Ihe liftle \nweaknesses .... lt's the \ntiftle things that count. \nOn one occasion, I \nworked on the presi­\ndent of a large hank in \nOmaha.

He feit honored and somewhat intimidated by \nthis sophisticated man, who spoke perfect English with a hint of a foreign \naccent. Over the days to come, the two became friends. \nLoUer of course did most of the talking, and one night he confessed \nthat his business was doing poorly, with more troubles ahead. In return, \nLustig confided in his new friend that he too had serious money \nproblems-Communists had seized his family estate and aU its assets. He \nwas too old to learn a trade and go to work. Luckily he had found an an­\nswer-\"a money-making machine.\" \"You counterf eit?\" LaUer whispere d in \nhalf-shock. No, Lustig replied, explaining that through a secret chemical \nprocess, his machine could duplicate any paper currency with complete ac­\ncuracy. Put in a doUar bill and six hours later you had two, both perfect. He \nproceeded to explain how the machine had been smuggle d out of Europe, \nhow the Germans had developed it to undermine the British, how it had \nsupported the count for several years, and on and on. When LaUer insisted \non a demonstration, the two men went to Lustig's room, where the count \nproduced a magnificent mahogany box fitted with slots, cranks, and dials. \nLoller watched as Lustig inserted a dollar bill in the box. Sure enough, \nearly the foUowing moming Lustig puUed out two bills, stiU wet from the \nchemicals. \nLustig gave the notes to LaUer, who immediately took the bills to a \nlocal bank-which accepted them as genuin e. Now the businessman fever­\nishly begged Lustig to sell hirn a machin e. The count explained that there \nwas only one in existence, so Loller made hirn a high offer: $25,000, then a \nconsiderable amount (more than $400,000 in today's terms). Even so, \nLustig seemed reluctant: He did not feel right about making his friend pay \nso much. Yet finally he agreed to the sale. After all, he said, \"I suppose it \nmatters little what you pay me. You are, after all, going to recover the \namount within a few days by duplicating your own bills.\" Making LoUer \nswear never to reveal the machine's existence to other people, Lustig ac­\ncepted the money. Later the same day he checked out of the hotel. A year \nlater, after many futile attempts at duplicating bills, LaUer finaUy went to \nthe police with the story of how Count Lustig had conned hirn with a pair \nof doUar bills, some chemicals, and a worthless mahogany box. \nInterpretation \nCount Lustig had an eagle eye for other people's weakne sses. He saw them \nin the smallest gesture. LaUer, for instance, overtipped waiters, seemed \nnervous in conversation with the concierge, talked loudly about his busi­\nness. His weakne ss, Lustig knew, was his need for social validation and for \nthe respect that he thought his wealth had earned hirn. He was also chroni­\ncally insecure. Lustig had come to the hotel to hunt for prey. In LaUer he \nhomed in on the perfect sucker-a man hungering for someone to fill his \npsychic voids. \nIn offering LoUer his friendship, then, Lustig knew he was offering him \nthe immediate respect of the other guests. As a count, Lustig was also offer-\ning the newly rich businessman access to the glittering world of old wealth. \nAnd for the coup de gräce, he apparently owned a machine that would res­\neue Laller from his worries. It would even put hirn on a par with Lustig \nhirnself, who had also used the machine to maintain his status. No wonder \nLoller took the bait. \nRememb er: When searching for suckers, always look for the dissatis­\nlied, the unhapp y, the insecure. Such people are riddled with weaknesses \nand have needs that you can fill. Their neediness is the groove in which \nyou place your thumbnail and turn them at will. \nObservance III \nIn the year 1559, the French king Henri II died in a jousting exhibiti on. His \nson assumed the throne, becoming Francis II, but in the background stood \nHenri's wife and queen, Catherine de' Medicis, a woman who had long \nago proven her skill in affairs of state. When Francis died the next year, \nCatherine took control of the country as regent to her next son in line of \nsueeession, the future Charles IX, a mere ten years old at the time. \nThe main threats to the queen's power were Antoine de Bourbon, king \nof Navarre, and his brother, Louis, the powerful prince of Cande, both of \nwhom could elaim the right to serve as regent instead of Catherine, who, \nafter all, was Italian-a foreigner. Catherine quickly appointed Antoine \nlieutenant general of the kingdom, a title that seemed to satisfy his ambi­\ntion. It also meant that he had to remain in court, where Catherine could \nkeep an eye on hirn. Her next move proved smarter still: Antoine had a \nnotorious weakness for young women, so she assigned one of her most at­\ntraetive maids of honor, Louise de Rouet, to seduce hirn. Now Antoine's \nintimate, Louise reported all of his actions to Catherin e. The move worked \nso brilliantly that Catherine assigned another of her maids to Prince \nConde, and thus was formed her escadron volant\\-\"f lying squadron\"-of \nyoung girls whom she used to keep the unsuspecting males in the court \nunder her control. \nIn 1572 Catherine married off her daughter, Marguerite de Valois, to \nHenri, the son of Antoine and the new king of Navarre. To put a family that \nhad always struggled against her so elose to power was a dangerous move, \nso to make sure of Henri's loyalty she unleashed on hirn the loveliest mem­\nber of her \"flying squadron,\" Charlotte de Beaune Semblan�ay, baroness \nof Sauves. Catherine did this even though Henri was married to her daugh­\nter. Within weeks, Marguerite de Valois wrote in her memoirs, \"Mme. de \nSauves so completely ensnared my husband that we no longer slept to­\ngether, nor even conversed.\" \nThe baroness was an excellent spy and helped to keep Henri under \nCatherine's thumb. When the queen's younge st son, the Duke of Alen�on, \ngrew so elose to Henri that she feared the two might plot against her, she \nassigned the baroness to hirn as weIl . This most infamous member of the \nflying squadron quickly seduced Alen�on, and soon the two young men \nfought over her and their friendship quickly ended, along with any danger \nof a conspiracy. And while I am on the \nsubject, there is another \nfact that deserves \nmention. I t is this. A \nman shows his charae­\nter just in the way in \nwhich he deals with \ntrifles-for then he is \noff his guard. This will \noften afford a good \nopportunity of ohserv­\ning ehe boundless \negoism of a man's \nnature, and his total \nlack of consideration \nfor others; and if these \ndefcets show them­\nselves in small things, \nor merely in his general \ndemeanour, you will \nfind that they also \nunderhe his action in \nmatters of importancc, \nalthough he may \ndisguise the fact. This ü \nan opportl/nity whieh \nshould not he missed. \nIf in the liule affairs of \nevery day-th e trifIes of \nlife ... -a man is \nineonsiderate and seeks \nonly what is advanta­\ngeous or convenient to \nhimselJ. to the preju­\ndice of others' rights; if \nhe appropriates to \nhirnself that which \nhelongs to a/l alike, you \nmay he sure there is no \njustiee in his heart, ami \nthat he would be a \nseoundrel on a whole­\nsale scale, only that law \nand compulsion hind \nhis hands. \nARTHUR \nSCHOPENHAUER, \n1788- 1860 \nLAW 33 277 \n'1'11 1': BAT T!.E ,lI' \nPIIAHSAL LI \nWhen the two armies \n[Julius Caesar's and \nPompey'sj were come \ninto Pharsalia, and \nboth eneamped there, \nPompey's thoughts ran \nthe same way as they \nhad done before, \nagainstfighting. , , , But \nthose who were about \nhim were greatly confi­\ndent of ;'!Ieeess ... as if \nthey had already \nconquered .... The \ncavalry especially were \nobstinate for fighting, \nbeing splendid/y armed \nand brave/y mounted, \nand valuing themselves \nupon the fine horses \nthey kept, and upon \ntheir own handsome \npersons; as also upon \nthe advantage oftheir \nnumbers, for they were \nfive thousand against \none thollsand of \nCaesar:,·. Nor were the \nnumbers ofthe infantry \nless disproportionate, \nthere being forty-five \nthollsand of Pompey :,. \nagainst twenty-two \nthousand ofthe enemy. \n[The next dayj whi/st \nthe infantry was thus \nsharp/y engaged in the \nmain battle, on the \nflank Pompey's horse \nrode up confidently, \nami opened [his \ncavalry:'1 ranks very \nwide, that they might \nsurround the right wing \nof Caesar. But before \nthey engaged, Caesar:, \ncohorts rushed out ami \nattaeked them, and did \nnot dart their ja velins \nat a distanee, nor strike \nat the thighs and legs, \nas they uSllally did in \nclose battle, but aimed \nat their faees. For thus \n278 LAW 33 Interpretation \nCatherine had seen very early on the sway that amistress has over a man \nof power: Her own husband, Henri 11, had kept one of the most infamous \nmistresses of them all, Diane de Poitiers_ What Catherine learned from the \nexperience was that a man like her husband wanted to feel he could win a \nwoman over without having to rely on his status, which he had inherited \nrather than earned_ And such a need contained a huge blind spot: As long \nas the woman began the affair by acting as if she had been conquered, the \nman would fail to notice that as time passed the mistress had come to hold \npower over hirn, as Diane de Poitiers did over Henri_ It was Catheri ne's \nstrategy to turn this weakne ss to her advantage , using it as a way to conquer \nand control men. All she had to do was unleash the loveliest women in the \ncourt, her \"flying squadro n,\" on men whom she knew shared her hus­\nband's vulnerability. \nRemem ber: Always look for passions and ob sessions that cannot be \ncontrolled. The stronger the passion, the more vulnerable the person. This \nmay seem surprising, for passionate people look strong. In fact, however, \nthey are simply filling the stage with their theatricality, distracting people \nfrom how weak and helpless they really are. A man's need to conquer \nwomen actually reveals a tremendous helplessness that has made suckers \nout of them for thousands of years. Look at the part of a person that is most \nvisible-their greed, their lust, their intense fear. These are the emotions \nthey cannot conceal, and over which they have the least control. And what \npeople cannot control, you can control for them. \nObservance IV \nArabella Hunting ton, wife of the great late-nineteenth-century railroad \nmagnate Collis P. Huntington, came from humble origins and always \nstruggled for social recognition among her wealthy peers. When she gave a \nparty in her San Francisco mansion, few of the social elite would show Upj \nmost of them took her for a gold digger, not their kind. Because of her hus­\nband's fabulous wealth, art dealers courted her, but with such condesc en­\nsion they obviously saw her as an upstart. Only one man of conseq uence \ntreated her different ly: the dealer Joseph Duveen. \nFor the first few years of Duveen's relationship with Arabella, he made \nno effort to seIl expensive art to her. Instead he accompanied her to fine \nstores, chatted endlessly about queens and princesses he knew, on and on. \nAt last, she thought, a man who treated her as an equal, even a superior, in \nhigh society. Meanwhile, ifDuveen did not try to seIl art to her, he did sub­\ntly educate her in his aesthetic ideas-namely, that the best art was the \nmost expensive art. And after Arabella had soaked up his way of seeing \nthings, Duveen would act as if she always had exquisite taste, even though \nbefore she met hirn her aesthetics had been abysmal. \nWhen Collis Huntington died, in 1900, Arabella came into a fortune. \nShe suddenly started to buy expensive paintings, by Rembrandt and \nVeläzquez, for example-and only from Duveen. Years later Duveen sold \nher Gainsboroug h's Blue Boy for the highest price ever paid for a work of \nart at the time, an astounding purchase for a family that previously had \nshown little interest in collecting. \nInterpretation \nJoseph Duveen instantly understood Arab ella Huntington and what made \nher tick : She wanted to feel important, at horne in soci ety. Intensely inse­\neure about her lower-class background, she needed confirmation of her \nnew social stat us. Duveen waited. Instead of rushing into trying to per­\nsuade her to collect art, he subtly went to work on her weak nesses. He \nmade her feel that she deserved his atte ntion not because she was the wife \nof one of the wealth iest men in the world but because of her own special \neharac ter-and this completely melted her. Duveen never condescended \nto Ara beIla; rather than lecturing to her, he instilled his ideas in her indi­\nreetly. The result was one of his best and most devoted clients, and also the \nsale of The Blue Boy. \nPeople's need far validation and recognit ion, their need to feel impor­\ntant, is the best kind of wea kness to expl oit. First, it is almost univers al; sec­\nond, exploiting it is so very easy. All you have to do is find ways to make \npeople feel better about their taste , their sodal standing, their intellig ence. \nOnce the fish are hooked, you can reel them in again and aga in, for \nyears -you are filling a positive role, giving them what they cannot get on \ntheir own. They may never suspect that you are turning them like a thumb­\nserew, and if they do they may not care, because you are making them feel \nbetter about themselve s, and that is worth any price. \nObservance V \nIn 1862 King William of Prussia named Otto von Bismarck premier and \nminister for foreign affa irs. Bismarck was known for his boldness, his ambi­\ntion-and his interest in strengthening the military. Since William was sur­\nrounded by liberal s in his govemment and cabinet, politidans who already \nwanted to limit his powers, it was quite dangerous for hirn to put Bismarck \nin this sensitive position. His wife , Queen Augusta, had tried to dis suade \nhirn, but although she usually got her way with hirn, this time William \nstuck to his guns. \nOnly a week after becom ing prime minister, Bismarck made an im­\npromptu speech to a few dozen ministers to convince them of the need to \nenlarge the army. He ended by saying, \"The great questions of the time \nwill be dedded, not by speeches and resolutions of majorities, but by iron \nand blood.\" His speech was immediately disseminated throughout Ger­\nmany. The queen screamed at her husband that Bismarck was a barbaric \nmilitar ist who was out to usurp control of Pru ssia, and that William had to \nlire hirn. The liber als in the govemment agreed with her. The outcry was \nso vehement that WiIliam began to be afraid he would end up on a scaf­\nfold, like Louis XVI of France, if he kept Bismarck on as prime minister. \nBismarck knew he had to get to the king befare it was too late . He also \nknew he had blundered, and should have tempered his fiery words. Yet as \nhe contemplated his strategy, he decided not to apologize but to do the \nexact opposite. Bismarck knew the king weIl. Caesar had instructed \nthem, in hopes that \nyoung gentlemen, who \nhad not known much \nof baltles and wounds, \nbut came wearing their \nhair long, in ehe jlower \nof their age and height \nof their beauty, would \nbe more apprehensive \nofsuch blows, and not \ncare for hazarding both \na danger at present and \na blemish for the \nfuture. \nAnd so it proved, for \nthey were so far from \nbearing the stroke of \nthe javelim; that they \neould not stand the \nsight ofthem, but \nturned about, ami \neovered their faces to \nsee ure them. Onee in \ndisorder, presently they \nturned about to jly; and \nso most shamefully \nruined alf. For those \nwho had beat them \nhack at onee \noutjlanked the infantry, \nand falling on their \nrear, cut ehem to pieces. \nPompey, who \neommanded the other \nwing ofthe army, when \nhe saw his cavalry thus \nbroken and flying, was \nno longer himself; nor \ndid he now remember \nthat he was Pompey the \nGreat, but, like one \nwhom some god had \ndeprived of his senses, \nretired to his tent with­\nout speaking a word, \nand there sat to expect \nthe event, till the whole \narmy was routed. \nTHE LlFE OF JULlllS \nCAESAR. \nPUJTARCH, \nC. A.D. 46-120 \nLAW 33 279 \n280 LAW 33 When the two men met, William, predictably, had been worked into a \ntizzy by the queen. He reiterated his fear of being guil lotined. But Bismarck \nonly replied, \"Yes, then we shall be dead! We must die sooner or later, and \ncould there be a more respectable way of dying? I should die fighting for \nthe cause of my king and master. Your Ma je sty would die sealing with your \nown blood your royal rights granted by God's grace. Whether upon the \nscaffold or upon the battle field make s no difference to the glorious staking \nof body and life on behalf of rights granted by God's grace !\" On he went, \nappealing to Willi am's sense of honor and the majesty of his position as \nhead of the army. How could the king allow people to push hirn around? \nWa sn't the honor of Germany more important than quibbling over words? \nNot only did the prime minister convince the king to stand up to both his \nwife and his parliament, he persuaded hirn to build up the army- Bis­\nmarck's goal all along. \nInterpretation \nBismarck knew the king feIt buHied by those around hirn. He knew that \nWilliam had a military background and a deep sense of honor, and that he \nfeit ashamed at his cravenness before his wife and his government. William \nsecretly yearned to be a great and mighty king, but he dared not express \nthis ambition because he was afraid of ending up like Louis XVI. Where a \nshow of courage often conceals a man's timidity, William's timidity con­\ncealed his need to show courage and thump his chest. \nBismarck sensed the longing for glory beneath Willi am's pacifist front, \nso he played to the king's insecurity about his manhood, finaHy pushing \nhirn into three wars and the creation of a German empire. Timidity is a po­\ntent weakness to exploit. Timid souls often yearn to be their opposit e-to \nbe Napoleons. Yet they lack the inner strength. You, in essence, can be­\ncome their Na poleon, pushing them into bold act ions that serve YOUf \nneeds while also making them dependent on you. Remember: Look to the \nopposites and never take appearances at face value. \nIm age: The \nTh umbsc rew . \nYo ur enemy \nhas secrets that \nhe guards, thinks \nthoughts he will \nnot revea l. But \nthey come out in \nways he cannot \nhelp. It is there some­\nwhere, a groove of \nweakness on his head, \nat his heart, over his \nbeH y. Once you find the \ngroove, put YOUf thumb in \ni t and turn hirn at will . \nAuthority: Find out each man's thumbscrew. 'Tis the art of setting their \nwills in action. It needs more skill than resolut ion. You must know \nwhere to get at anyone. Every volition has a special motive which varies \naccording to taste. All men are idolaters, some of farne, others of self­\ninterest, most of pleasure. Skill consists in knowing these idols in order \nto bring them into play. Knowing any man's mainspring of motive \nyou have as it were the key to his will. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) \nREVERSAL \nPlaying on people's weakness has one significant danger: You may stir up \nan action you cannot control. \nIn YOUf games of power you always look several steps ahead and plan \naccordingly. And you exploit the fact that other people are more emotional \nand incapable of such foresight. But when you play on their vulnerabiliti es, \nthe areas over which they have least control, you can unleash emotions \nthat will upset YOUf plans. Push timid people into bold action and they may \ngo too far; answer their need for attention or recognition and they may \nneed more than you want to give them. The helpless, childish element you \nare playing on can turn against you. \nThe more emotional the weakness, the greater the potential danger. \nKnow the limits to this game, then, and never get carried away by your \ncontrol over YOUf victims. You are after power, not the thrill of control. \nLAW 33 281 \n282 LAW \n34 \nBE RO YA L IN YO UR OWN \nFASHI ON : ACT LIKE A \nKING TO BE TREATE D \nLIKE ONE \nJUDGMENT \nThe way you carry yourself will often determine how you \nare treated: In the long run, appearing vulgar or com­\nmon will make people disr espect you. For a king respects \nhimself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By \nacting regally and confident 0/ your powers, you make \nyourself seem destined to wear a crown. \nTRANSGR ESSION OF THE LAW \nIn July of 1830, a revolution broke out in Paris that forced the king, \nCharles X, to abdicate . A commission of the highest authoriti es in the land \ngathered to choose a successor, and the man they picked was Louis­\nPhilippe, the Duke of Orleans. \nFrom the beginning it was clear that Louis-Philippe would be a differ­\nent kind of king, and not just because he came from a different branch of \nthe royal family, or because he had not inherited the crown but had been \ngiven it, by a commission, putting his legitimacy in question. Rather it was \nthat he disliked ceremony and the trappings of royalty ; he had more \nfriends among the bankers than among the nobil ity; and his style was not \nto create a new kind of royal rule, as Napoleon had done, but to downplay \nhis status, the better to mix with the businessmen and middle-class folk \nwho had called hirn to lead. Thus the symbols that came to be associa ted \nwith Louis-Philippe were neither the scepter nor the crown, but the gray \nhat and umbrella with which he would proudly walk the streets of Paris, as \nifhe were a bourgeois out for a stroll. When Louis-Philip pe invitedJames \nRothschild, the most important banker in France, to his palace, he treated \nhim as an equal. And unlike any king before hirn, not only did he talk busi­\nness with Monsieur Rothschild but that was literally all he talked, for he \nloved money and had amassed a huge fortune. \nAs the reign of the \"bourgeois king\" plodded on, people came to de­\nspise hirn . The aristocracy could not endure the sight of an unkingly king, \nand within a few years they tumed on hirn. Meanwhile the growing class of \nthe poor, including the radicals who had chased out Charles X, found no \nsatisfaction in a ruler who neither acted as a king nor govemed as a man of \nthe people. The bankers to whom Louis-Phili ppe was the most beholden \nsoon realized that it was they who controlled the country, not he, and they \ntreated hirn with growing contempt. One day, at the start of a train trip or­\nganized for the royal family, James Rothschild actually berated him-and \nin public-for being late. Once the king had made news by treating the \nbanker as an equal; now the banker treated the king as an inferior. \nEventually the workers' insurrections that had brought down Louis­\nPhilippe's predecessor began to reemerge, and the king put them down \nwith force. But what was he defending so brutally? Not the institution ofthe \nmonarchy, which he disdained, nor a democra tic republic, which his rule \nprevente d. What he was really defending, it seemed, was his own fortune, \nand the fortunes of the bankers-not a way to inspire loyalty among the \ncitizenry. \nIn early 1848, Frenchmen of all classes began to demonstrate for elec­\ntoral reforms that would make the country truly democrat ic. By February \nthe demonstrations had tumed violent. To assuage the populace, Louis­\nPhilippe fired his prime minister and appointed a liberal as areplacement. \nBut this created the opposite of the desired effect: The people sensed they \ncould push the king around. The demonstrations tumed into a full-fledged \nrevoluti on, with gunfire and barricades in the streets. Never lose your \nself-respect, nor be too \nfamiliar with yourself \n. when you are ahme. \nLet your integrity itself\" \nbe your own standard \nof rectitude, and be \nmore indebted to the \nseverity of your own \njudgment of yourself \nthan to all external \nprecepts.

With a suddenness that caught everyone by surprise, Louis­\nPhil ippe abdicated that very evening and fled to England. He left no suc­\ncessor, nor even the suggestion of one--his whole government folded up \nand dissolved like a traveling circus leaving town. \nInterpretation \nLouis- Philippe consciously dissolved the aura that naturally pertains to \nkings and leaders. Scof fing at the symbolism of gran deur, he believed a \nnew world was dawning, where rulers should act and be like ordinary citi­\nzens. He was right: A new world, without kings and queens, was cert ainly \non its way. He was profoundly wrong, however, in predict ing a change in \nthe dynamics of power. \nThe bourge ois king's hat and umbrella amu sed the French at first, but \nsoon grew irritating. People knew that Louis-Philippe was not really like \nthem at all-that the hat and umbrella were essentially a kind of trick to en­\ncourage them in the fantasy that the country had suddenly grown more \nequal. Actually, though, the divisions of wealth had never been grea ter. \nThe French expected their ruler to be a bit of a showman, to have some \npresence. Even a radical like Robespierre, who had briefly come to power \nduring the French Revolution fifty years earlier, had understood this, and \ncertainly Napoleon, who had turned the revolutionary republic into an im­\nperial regime, had known it in his bones. Indeed as soon as Louis- Philippe \nfled the stage, the French revealed their true desire: They elected \nNapoleon's grand-nephew president. He was a virtual unk nown, but they \nhoped he would re-crea te the great general's powerful aura, erasing the \nawkw ard memory of the \"bourgeois king .\" \nPowerful people may be tempted to affe ct a common-man aura, trying \nto create the illusion that they and their subjects or underlings are basi cally \nthe same. But the people whom this false ge sture is intended to impress will \nquickly see through it. They understand that they are not being given more \npower-that it only appears as if they shared in the powerful person's fate. \nThe only kind of common touch that works is the kind affe cted by Franklin \nRoosevelt, a style that said the president shared values and goals with the \ncommon people even while he remained a patrician at heart. He never \npretended to erase his distance from the crowd. \nLeaders who try to dissolve that dista nce through a false chumminess \ngradually lose the ability to inspire loyalty, fear, or love. Instead they elicit \ncontempt. Like Louis- Philippe, they are too uninspiring even to be worth \nthe guillotine--the best they can do is simply vanish in the night, as if they \nwere never there. \nOBSER VA NCE OF THE LAW \nWhen Christopher Columbus was trying to find funding for his legendary \nvoyages, many around hirn believed he came from the ltalian aristocra cy. \nThis view was passed into history through a biography written after the ex­\nplorer's dea th by his son, which describes hirn as a descendant of a Count \nColombo of the Castle of Cuccaro in Montferrat. Colombo in turn was said \nto be descended from the legendary Roman general Colonius, and two of \nhis first cousins were supposedly direct descenda nts of an emperor of Con­\nstantinopl e. An ilIustrious background indeed. But it was nothing more \nthan ilIustrious fantasy, for Columbus was actually the son of Domenico \nColomb o, a humble weaver who had opened a wine shop when Christo­\npher was a young man, and who then made his living by seIling cheese. \nColumbus hirnself had created the myth of his noble backgro und, be­\ncause from early on he feit that destiny had singled hirn out for great \nthings, and that he had a kind of royalty in his blood. Accordingly he acted \nas if he were indeed descended from noble stock. After an uneventful ca­\nreer as a merchant on a commercial vessel, Columbus, originally from \nGenoa, settled in Lisbon. Using the fabricated story of his noble back­\nground, he married into an established Lisbon family that had exceIIent \nconnections with Portuguese royalty. \nThrough his in-Iaws, Columbus finagled a meeting with the king of \nPortugal, Joäo 11, whom he petitioned to finance a westward voyage aimed \nat discovering a shorter route to Asia. In return for announcing that any \ndiscoveries he achieved would be made in the king's name, Columbus \nIiowanted aseries of rights: the title Grand Admiral of the Oceanic Sea; the \noffice of viceroy over any lands he found; and 10 percent of the future \ncommerce with such lands. All of these rights were to be hereditary and for \naIl time. Columbus made these demands even though he had previously \nbeen a mere merchant, he knew almost nothing about navigati on, he could \nnot work a quadrant, and he had never led a group of men. In short he had \nabsolutely no qualifications for the journey he proposed. Furthermore, his \npetition incIuded no details as to how he would accomplish his plans, just \nvague promises. \nWhen Columbus finished his pitch, Joäo 11 smiled: He politely de­\ncIined the offer, but left the door open for the future. Here Columbus mu�t \nhave noticed something he would never forget: Even as the king turned \ndown the sailor's demands, he treated them as legitimate . He neither \nlaughed at Columbus nor questioned his background and credentials . In \nfact the king was impressed by the boldness of Columbus's requests, and \ncIearly feit comfortable in the company of a man who acted so confidently. \nThe meeting must have convinced Columbus that his instincts were cor­\nrect: By asking for the mo on, he had instantly raised his own status, for the \nking assumed that unless a man who set such a high price on hirnself were \nmad, which Columbus did not appear to be, he must somehow be worth it. \nA few years later Columbus moved to Spain. Using his Portuguese \nconnections, he moved in elevated circles at the Spanish court, receiving \nsubsidies from ilIustrious financiers and sharing tables with dukes and \nprinces. To all these men he repeated his request for financing for a voyage \nto the west-and also for the rights he had demanded fromJoäo 11. Some, \nsuch as the powerful duke of Medina, wanted to help, but could not, since \nthey lacked the power to grant hirn the titles and rights he wanted. But \nColumbus would not back down. He soon realized that only one person HII'f'OCLLI IlE\" ,\\'I' \nSlCY O,\\ \nIn the next generation \nthe family became \nmuch more famous \nthan before through the \ndistinction conferred \nupon it by Cleisthenes \nthe master of 5icyon. \nCleisthenes ' .. had a \ndaughter, Agarista, \nwhom he wished to \nmarry to the hest man \nin all Creece. 50 du ring \nthe Olympic games, in \nwhich he had himself \nwon the chariot race, he \nhad a puhlic announce­\nment made, to the effect \nthat any Creek who \nthought himself good \nenough to oecome \nCleisthenes' son-in-law \nshould present himself \nin 5icyon within sixty \ndays-or sooner if he \nwished-because he \nintended, within fhe \nyear following the \nsixtiefh day, fo hetmth \nhis daughter to her \nfuture hushand, \nCleisfhenes had had a \nrace-frack and a \nwrestling-ring specially \nmade for his purpose, \nami presently the suit­\nors began to arrive­\nevery man of Creek \nnational ity who had \nsomething to be proud \nof either in his coun try \nor in himsel!

In 1487 he finally managed a \nmeeting with the queen, and although he could not convince her to finance \nthe voyage , he completely charmed her, and became a frequent guest in \nthe palace. \nIn 1492 the Spanish finally expelled the Moorish invaders who cen­\nturies earlier had seized parts of the country. With the wartime burden on \nher treasury lifted, Isabella feit she could finally respond to the demands of \nher explorer friend, and she decided to pay for three ships, equipment, the \nsalaries of the crews, and a modest stipend for Columbus. More important, \nshe had a contract drawn up that granted Columbus the titles and rights on \nwhich he had insisted. The only one she denied -and only in the contract's \nfine print-was the 10 percent of all revenues from any lands discovered: \nan absurd demand, since he wanted no time limit on it. (Had the clause \nbeen left in, it would eventually have made Columbus and his heirs the \nwealthiest familyon the planet. Columbus never read the fine print.) \nSatisfied that his demands had been met, Columbus set sail that same \nyear in search of the passage to Asia. (Before he left he was careful to hire \nthe best navigator he could find to help hirn get there.) The mission failed \nto find such a passage, yet when Columbus petitioned the queen to finance \nan even more ambitious voyage the following year, she agreed. By then \nshe had come to see Columbus as destined for great things, \nInterpretat ion \nAs an explorer Columbus was mediocre at best. He knew less about the \nsea than did the average sailor on his ships, could never determine the lati­\ntude and longitude of his discoveries, mistook islands for vast continents, \nand treated his crew badly. But in one area he was a genius: He knew how \nto seIl hirnself. How else to explain how the son of a cheese vendor, a low­\nlevel sea merchant, managed to ingratiate hirnself with the highest royal \nand aristocratic farnilies? \nColumbus had an amazing power to charm the nobility, and it all \ncame from the way he carried hirnself. He projected a sense of confidence \nthat was completely out of proportion to his means. Nor was his confidence \nthe aggressive, ugly self-promotion of an upstart-it was a quiet and calm \nself-assuran ce, In fact it was the same confidence usually shown by the no­\nbility themselve s. The powerful in the old-style aristocracies feit no need to \nprove or assert themsel ves; being noble, they knew they always deserved \nmore, and asked for it. With Columbus, then, they felt an instant affinity, \nfor he carried hirnself just the way they did-elevated above the crowd, \ndestined for greatness. \nUndersta nd: It is within your power to set your own price. How you \ncarry yourself reflects what you think of yourself. If you ask for little, shuf­\nfle your feet and lower your head, people will assurne this reflects your \ncharacter. But this behavior is not you-it is only how you have chosen to \npresent yourself to other people. You can just as easily present the Colum­\nbus front: buoyancy, confidence, and the feeling that you were born to \nwear a crown. \nWith alt great deceivers there is a noteworthy occurrence to which they owe their \npower. In the actual act 0/ deception they are overcome by belief in themselves: it is \nthis which then speaks so miraculousl y and compelti ngly to those around them. \nFriedrich Nietz sehe, 1844-1 900 \nKEYS TO POWER \nAs children, we start OUf lives with great exuberance, expecting and de­\nmanding everything from the world. This generally carries over into OUf \nfirst forays into society, as we begin OUf careers . But as we grow older the \nrebuffs and failUfes we experience set up boundaries that only get firmer \nwith time. Coming to expect less from the world, we accept limitations that \nare really self-imposed. We start to bow and scrape and apologize for even \nthe simplest of requests. The solution to such a shrinking of horizons is to \ndeliberately force ourselves in the opposite directio n-to downplay the \nfailures and ignore the limitati ons, to make oUfselv es demand and expect \nas much as the child. To accomplish this, we must use a particular strategy \nupon oUfselves. Call it the Strategy of the Crown. \nThe Strategy of the Crown is based on a simple chain of cause and ef­\nfect: If we believe we are destined for great things, OUf belief will radiate \noutward, just as a crown creates an aura around a king. This outward radi­\nance will infect the people around us, who will think we must have reasons \nto feel so confident. People who wear crowns seem to feel no inner sense of \nthe limits to what they can ask for or what they can accomplish. This too \nradiates outward. Limits and boundaries disappear. Use the Strategy of the \nCrown and you will be surprised how often it bears fruit. Take as an exam­\npIe those happy children who ask for whatever they want, and get it. Their \nhigh expectat ions are their charm. Adults enjoy granting their wishes- just \nas Isabella enjoyed granting the wishes of Columb us. \nThroughout history, people of undistinguished birth-the Theodoras of \n� Byzantium, the Columbu ses, the Beethovens, the Disraelis-have managed \nto work the Strategy of the Crown, believing so firmly in their own greatness \nthat it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The trick is simp le: Be overcome \nby yoUf self-belief. Even while you know you are practicing a kind of de­\nception on YOUfse lf, act like a king. You are likely to be treated as one. \nThe crown may separate you from other people, but it is up to you to \nmake that separati on real: You have to act differently, demoll Strating your \ndistance from those around you. One way to emphasize YOUf difference is \nto always act with dignity, no matter the circumsta nce. Louis-Philippe gave \nno sense of being different from other people -he was the banker king. \nAnd the moment his subjects threatened him, he caved in. Everyone \nsensed this and pounced. Lacking regal dignity and firmness of purpose, \nLouis-Philippe seemed an impostor, and the crown was easily toppled \nfrom his head. \nRegal bearing should not be confused with arrogan ce. Arrogance may \nseem the king's entitlement, but in fact it betrays insecurity. It is the very \nopposite of a royal demeanor. Hippoc!eides, c/imbing \non to it, danced first \n.\\'Onle Laconian dances, \nnext some Attic ones, \nand ended by standing \non his head and beat­\ning time with his legs in \nthe air. The Laconian \nand Altic dan ces were \nbad enough; but \nCleisthenes , thol/gh \nhe already loathed the \nthought o[ having a \nson-in-law like that, \nnevertheless restrained \nhimself and managed \nto avoid an outburst; \nbut when he saw \nHippocleides beating \ntime with his legs, he \ncould bear it no Ion ger. \n\"Son of Tisander,\" he \ncried, \"you have \ndanced away your \nmarriage.\" \nTIIE HISTORIFS . \nHFRODOTliS . \nFWfl! CENTURY Re. \nLAW 34 287 \n288 LAW 34 Haile Selassie, mler of Ethiopia for forty or SO years beginning in 1930, \nwas once a young man named Lij Tafari. He came from a noble family, but \nthere was no real chance of hirn coming to power, for he was far down the \nline of succession from the king then on the throne, Menelik 11. Neverthe­\nless, from an early age he exhibited a self -confidence and a royal bearing \nthat surprised everyone around hirn. \nAt the age of fourteen, Tafari went to live at the court, where he imme­\ndiately impressed Menelik and became his favorite . Tafar i's grace under \nfire, his patien ce, and his calm self-assurance fascinated the king. The other \nyoung nobles, arrogant, blustery, and envious, would push this slight, \nbookish teenager around. But he never got angry-that would have been a \nsign of insecurity, to which he would not stoop. There were already people \naround hirn who feIt he would someday rise to the top, for he acted as ifhe \nwere already there. \nYears later, in 1936, when the ltalian Fascists had taken over Ethiopia \nand Tafari, now called Haile Selassie, was in exile, he addressed the League \nof Nations to plead his country 's case. The Italians in the audience heckled \nhirn with vulgar abuse, but he maintained his dignified pose, as if corn­\n. pletely unaff ected. This elevated hirn while making his opponents look \neven uglier. Dignity, in fact, is invariably the mask to assurne under difficult \ncircumsta nces: It is as if nothing can affect you, and you have all the time \nin the world to respond. This is an extremely powerful pose. \nA royal demeanor has other uses. Con artists have long known the \nvalue of an aristocratic front; it either dis arms people and makes them less \nsuspicious, or else it intimidates them and puts them on the defensiv�and \nas Count Victor Lustig knew, once you put a sucker on the defensive he is \ndoomed. The con man Yellow Kid Weil, too, would often assurne the trap­\npings of a man of wealth, along with the nonchalance that goes with thern. \nAlluding to some magical method of making money, he would stand aloof, \nlike a king, exuding confidence as if he really were fabulously rich. The \nsuckers would beg to be in on the con, to have a chance at the wealth that \nhe so clearly displayed. \nFinally, to reinf orce the inner psychological tricks involved in project­\ning a royal demeanor, there are outward strateg ies to help you create the \neffect. First, the Columbus Strategy: Always make a bold demand. Set your \nprice high and do not waver. Second, in a dignified way, go after the high­\nest person in the building. This immediately puts you on the same plane as \nthe chief executive you are attacki ng. It is the David and Goliath Strategy: \nBy choosing a great opponent, you create the appearance of great ness. \nThird, give a gift of some sort to those above you. This is the strategy \nof those who have a patron: By giving your patron a gift, you are essentially \nsaying that the two of you are equal. It is the old con game of giving so that \nyou can take. When the Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino wanted the \nDuke of Mantua as his next patron, he knew that if he was slavish and \nsycophantic, the duke would think hirn unworthy ; so he approached the \nduke with gifts, in this case paintings by the writer's good friend Titian. \nAccepting the gifts created a kind of equality between duke and writer: The \nduke was put at ease by the feeling that he was dealing with a man of his \nown aristocratie stamp. He funded Aretino generously. The gift strategy is \nsubtle and brilliant beeause you do not beg: You ask for help in a dignified \nway that implies equality between two people, one of whom just happens \nto have more money. \nRemember: It is up to you to set your own priee. Ask for less and that \nis just what you will get. Ask for more, however, and you send a signal that \nyou are worth a king's ransom. Even those who turn you down respeet you \nfor your eonfidenee, and that respeet will eventually pay off in ways you \ncannot imagine. \nImage: The Crown. Plaee it upon your head \nand you assume a di fferent pose-tranquil \nyet radiating assuranee . Never show \ndoubt, never lose your dignity beneath \nthe erown, or it will not fit. It will seem \nto be destined for one more worthy. Do \nnot wait for a eoronat ion; the great­\nest emperors crown themselves . \nAuthority : Everyone should be royal after his own fashion. Let all your \nactions, even though they are not those of a king, be, in their own \nsphere, worthy of one. Be sublime in your deeds, lofty in your \nthoughts; and in all your doings show that you deserve to be a king \neven though you are not one in reality. (Baltasar Graeiän, 1601-1658) \nLAW 34 289 \n290 LAW 34 REVE RSAL \nThe idea behind the assumption of regal confidence is to set yourself apart \nfrom other people, but if you take this too far it will be your undoing. \nNever make the mistake of thinking that you elevate yourself by humili at­\ning people. Also, it is never a good idea to 100m too high above the \ncrow d-you make an easy target. And there are times when an aristocratic \npose is eminently danger ous. \nCharles I, king of England during the 1640s, faced a profound public \ndisenchantment with the institution of monarchy. Revolts erupted through­\nout the country, led by Oliver Cromwell . Had Charles reacted to the times \nwith insight, supporting reforms and making a show of sacrificing some of \nhis power, history might have been different. Instead he reverted to an \neven more regal pose, seeming outraged by the assa ult on his power and \non the divine institution of monarchy. His stiff kingli ness offended people \nand spurred on their revolts . And eventually Charles lost his head, liter ally. \nUndersta nd: You are radiating confidence, not arrogance or disdain . \nFinally, it is true that you can sometimes find some power through af­\nfecting a kind of earthy vulgarity, which will prove amusing by its extreme­\nness. But to the extent that you win this game by going beyond the limits, \nsep arating yourself from other people by appearing even more vulgar than \nthey are, the game is dang erous: There will always be people more vulgar \nthan you, and you will easily be replaced the following season by someone \nyounger and worse. \nLAW \n35 \nMASTER THE ART \nOF TIMIN G \nJUDGME NT \nNever seem to be in a hurry-hurrying betrays a lack of \ncontrol over yourself, and over time.

Yet he never completely committed \nhimself to the church, never took his vows as a prie st-he had bigger plans. \nPatiently waiting for his chance, he kept his options open. And when the \nFrench Revolution broke out, in 1789, Fouche waite d no longer: He got rid \nof his cassock, grew his hair long, and became a revolution ary. For this was \nthe spirit of the times. To miss the boat at this critical moment could have \nspelt disaster. Fouche did not miss the boat: Befriending the revolutionary \nleader Robespierre, he quickly rose in the rebel ranks. In 1792 the town of \nNantes elected Fouche to be its repres entative to the Nati onal Convention \n(created that year to frame a new cons titution for a French republic) . \nWhen Fouche arrived in Pari s to take his seat at the convention, a vio­\nlent rift had broken out between the moderates and the radical Jacobins. \nFouche sensed that in the long run neither side would emerge victorious. \nPower rarely ends up in the hands of those who start a revolution, or even \nof those who furth er it; power sticks to those who bring it to a conclusion. \nThat was the side Fouche wanted to be on. \nHis sense of timing was uncanny. He started as a moderate, for moder­\nates were in the majority. When the time came to decide on whether or not \nto execute Louis XVI, however, he saw that the people were clamoring for \nthe king's head, so he cast the deciding vote--fo r the guillotine. Now he \nhad become a radical. Yet as tensions came to the boll in Paris, he foresaw \nthe danger of being too closely associated with any one facti on, so he ac­\ncepted a position in the provinces, where he could lie low for a while . A \nfew months later he was assigned to the post of proconsul in Lyons, where \nhe oversaw the execution of dozens of aristocrats. At a certain moment, \nhowever, he called a halt to the killings, sensing that the mood of the coun­\ntry was turning-and despite the blood already on his hands, the citizens of \nLyons hailed him as a savior from what had become known as the Terror. \nSo far Fouche had played his cards brilliantly, but in 1794 his old \nfriend Rob espierre recalled him to Paris to account for his actions in Lyons. \nRobespierre had been the driving force behind the Terror. He had sent \nheads on both the right and the left rolling, and Fouche, whom he no \nlonger truste d, seemed desti ned to provide the next head. Over the next \nfew weeks, a tense struggle ensued: While Rob espierre railed openly \nagainst Fouche, accusing of him dangerous ambit ions and calling for his ar­\nrest, the crafty Fouche worked more indirectly, quietly gaining support \namong those who were beginning to tire of Robespierre's dictatorial con­\ntrol. Fouche was playing for time . He knew that the longer he survived, the \nmore disaff ected citizens he could rally against Robespierre. He had to \nhave broad support before he moved against the powernd leader. He ral­\nlied support among both the moderates and the Jacobi ns, playing on the \nwidespread fear of Robespi erre- -everyone was afraid of being the next to \ngo to the guilloti ne. It all came to frui tion on July 27: The conve ntion \ntumed against Robespierre, shouting down his usual lengthy speech. He \nwas quickly arre sted, and a few days later it was Robespierre 's head, not \nFouche's, that fell into the basket. \nWhen Fouche returned to the convention after Ro bespierre 's death, he \nplayed his most unexpected move: Having led the conspiracy against \nRobespierre, he was expected to sit with the moderates, but 10 and behold, \nhe once again changed sides, joining the radical Jacobins. For perhaps the \nfirst time in his life he aligned hirnself with the minority. Clearly he sensed \nareaction stirring: He knew that the modera te faction that had executed \nRobespierre, and was now about to take power, would initiate a new round \nof the Terror, this time against the radicals. In siding with the Jacobins, \nthen, Fouche was sitting with the martyrs of the days to come---the people \nwho would be considered blameless in the troubles that were on their way. \nTaking sides with what was about to become the losing team was a risky \ngambit, of course, but Fouche must have calculated he could keep his head \nlong enough to quietly stir up the populace against the moderates and \nwatch them fall from power. And indeed, although the moderates did call \nfor his arrest in December of 1795, and would have sent hirn to the guillo­\ntine, too much time had passed. The executions had be co me unpopular \nwith the people, and Fouche survived the swing of the pendulum one more \ntime. \nA new government took over, the Directoire . It was not, however, a \nJacobin government, but a moderate one---more moderate than the gov­\nemment that had reimposed the Terror. Fouche, the radical, had kept his \nhead, but now he had to keep a low profile. He waited patiently on the \nsidelines for several years, allowing time to soften any bitter feelings \nagainst hirn, then he approached the Directoire and convinced them he \nhad a new passion: intellig ence-gathering. He became a paid spy for the \ngovemm ent, excelled at the job, and in 1799 was rewarded by being made \nminister of police. Now he was not just empowered but required to extend \nhis spying to every corner of France---a responsibi lity that would greatly \nreinforce his natural ability to sniff out where the wind was blowing. One \nof the first social trends he detected, in fact, came in the person of \nNapoleon, a brash young general whose destiny he right away saw was en­\ntwined with the future of France. When Napoleon unleashed a coup d'etat, \non November 9, 1799, Fouche pretended to be asleep. Indeed he slept the \nwhole day. For this indirect assistance ---it might have been thought his job, \nafter all, to prevent a military coup-Napoleon kept hirn on as minister of \npolice in the new regime. \nOver the next few years, Napoleon came to rely on Fouche more and \nmore. He even gave this former revolutionary a title, duke of Otranto, and \nrewarded hirn with great wealth. By 1808, however, Fouche, always at­\ntuned to the times, sensed that Napoleon was on the downswing. His futile \nwar with Spain, a country that posed no threat to France, was a sign that he \nwas losing a sense of proportion. Never one to be caught on a sinking ship, \nFouche conspired with Talleyrand to bring about Napoleon's downfall. Al-possessing a jlowing \ntail, which was remark­\nable for the thickness \nand beauty of ifs hair. \nBy the side ofthe weak \nhorse stood a tall \nstrong man, and by the \nside of the powerful \nhO\"'e a short man oI \nmean physique. At a \nsignal the strong man \nseized the tai! of his \nhorse and tried with all \nhis strength to pull it \ntowards hirn, as if to \ntear if off, while the \nweak man began to \npull the hairs one by \none from the tail of the \nstrang horse. \nThe strong man, after \ntugging with all his \nmight to no purpose \nand causing the specta­\ntors a great deal of \namusement in the \npracess, finally gave up \nthe attempt, while the \nweak man quickly and \nwifh very little trouble \nstripped his horse 's tai! \ncompletely bare. Then \nSertorius rose to his \nfeet and said, \"Now \nyou can see, my friends \nand allies, that perse­\nverance is more effec­\ntive than brute strength, \nand that there are many \ndifficulties that cannot \nbe overcome if you try \nto do everything at \non ce, but which will \nyield if you master \nthem liftle by little.

Ey 1814 Napoleon's power had \ncrumbled and allied forces finally conquered hirn. \nThe next government was arestoration of the monarchy, in the form \nof King Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI. Fouche, his nose always sniff­\ning the air for the next social shift, knew Louis would not last long-he had \nnone of Napoleon's flair. Fouche once again played his waiting game, lying \nlow, staying away from the spotlight. Sure enough, in February of 1815, \nNapoleon escaped from the island of Elba, where he had been imprisoned. \nLouis XVIII panicked: His policies had alienated the citizenry, who were \nclamoring for Napoleon's return. So Louis turned to the one man who \ncould maybe have saved his hide, Fouche, the former radical who had sent \nhis brother, Louis XVI, to the guillotine, but was now one of the most pop­\nular and widely admired politicians in France. Fouche, however, would not \nside with a loser: He refused Louis's request for help by pretending that bis \nhelp was unnecessa ry-by swearing that Napoleon would never return \nto power (although he knew otherwise). A short time later, of course, \nNapoleon and his new citizen army were closing in on Paris. \nSeeing his reign about to collapse, feeling that Fouche had betrayed \nhirn, and certain that he did not want this powerful and able man on \nNapoleon's team, King Louis ordered the minister's arrest and execution. \nOn March 16, 1815, policemen surrounded Fouche's coach on a Paris \nboulevard. Was this finally his end? Perhaps, but not immediately : Fouche \ntold the police that an ex-member of government could not be arrested on \nthe street. They fell for the story and allowed hirn to return horne. Later \nthat day, though, they came to his house and once again declared hirn \nunder arrest. Fouche nodded-but would the officers be so kind as allow a \ngentleman to wash and to change his clothes before leaving his house for \nthe last time? They gave their permission, Fouche left the room, and the \nminutes went by. Fouche did not return. Finally the policemen went into \nthe next room-where they saw a ladder against an open window, leading \ndown to the garden below. \nThat day and the next the police combed Paris for Fouche, but by then \nNapoleon's cannons were audible in the distance and the king and all the \nking's men had to flee the city. As soon as Napoleon entered Paris, Fouche \ncame out of hiding. He had cheated the executioner once again. Napoleon \ngreeted his former minister of police and gladly restored hirn to his old \npost. During the 100 days that Napoleon remained in power, until Water-\n100, it was essentially Fouche who governed France. After Napoleon fell, \nLouis XVIII returned to the throne, and like a cat with nine lives, Fauche \nstayed on to serve in yet another governmen t-by then his power and in­\nfluence had grown so great that not even the king dared challenge hirn. \nInterpretation \nIn aperiod of unprecedented turmoil, Joseph Fouche thrived through his \nmastery of the art of timing. He teaches us a number of key lessons. \nFirst, it is critical to recognize the spirit of the times. Fouche always \nlooked two steps ahead, found the wave that would carry hirn to power, \nand rode it. You must always work with the times, anticipate twists and \nturns, and never miss the boat. Sometimes the spirit of the times is obscure: \nRecognize it not by what is loudest and most obvious in it, but by what lies \nhidden and dormant. Look forward to the Napoleons of the future rather \nthan holding on to the ruins of the past. \nSecond, recognizing the prevailing winds does not necessarily mean \nrunning with them. Any potent social movement creates a powerful reac­\ntion, and it is wise to anticipate what that reaction will be, as Fouche did \nafter the execution of Robespierre . Rather than ride the cresting wave of \nthe moment, wait for the tide's ebb to carry you back to power. Upon occa­\nsion bet on the re action that is brewing, and place yourself in the vanguard \nof it. \nFinally, Fouche had remarkable patience. Without patience as your \nsword and shield, your timing will fail and you will inevitably find yourself \na loser. When the times were against Fouche, he did not struggle, get emo­\ntional, or strike out rashly. He kept his cool and maintained a low profile, \npatiently building support among the citizenry, the bulwark in his next rise \nto power. Whenever he found hirnself in the weaker position, he played for \ntime, which he knew would always be his ally if he was patient. Recognize \nthe moment, then, to hide in the grass or slither under a rock, as weIl as the \nmoment to bare your fangs and attack. \nKEYS TO POWER Space we can recover, time never. \nNap oleon Bona parte, 1769-18 21 \nTime is an artificial concept that we ourselves have created to make the \nlimitlessness of eternity and the universe more bearable, more human. \nSince we have constructed the concept of time, we are also able to mold it \nto some degree, to play tricks with it. The time of a child is long and slow, \nwith vast expanses; the time of an adult whizzes by frighteningly fast. \nTime, then, depends on perception, which, we know, can be willfully al­\ntered. This is the first thing to understand in mastering the art of timing. If \nthe inner turmoil caused by our emotions tends to make time move faster, \nit follows that once we control our emotional responses to events, time will \nmove much more slowly. This altered way of dealing with things tends to \nlengthen our perception of future time, opens up possibilities that fear and \nanger dose off, and allows us the patience that is the principal requirement \nin the art of timing. \nThere are three kinds of time for us to deal with; each presents prob­\nlems that can be solved with skill and practice. First there is long time: the \ndrawn-out, years-Iong kind of time that must be managed with patience \nand gentle guidance. Our handling of long time should be mostly defen­\nsive-this is the art of not reacting impulsively, of waiting for opportunity. we shall be in trouble.\" \nSo he had the fellow's \nfeet cut off Both fami­\nlies did exaetly the \nsame thing, but one \ntimed it right, the other \nwrong.

The famous seventeenth -century Ming painter Chou Yung \nrelates a story that altered his behavior forever. Late one winter af temoon \nhe set out to visit a town that lay across the river from his own town. He \nwas bringing some important books and papers with hirn and had commis­\nsioned a young boy to help hirn carry them. As the ferry neared the other \nside ofthe river, Chou Yung asked the boatman ifthey would have time to \nget to the town before its gates closed, since it was a mHe away and night \nwas approaching. The boatman glanced at the boy, and at the bundle of \nloosely tied papers and books-\"Y es,\" he replied, \"if you do not walk too \nfast.\" \nAs they started out, however, the sun was setting. Afraid of being \nlocked out of the town at night, prey to local bandits, Chou and the boy \nwalked faster and faster, finally breaking into a run. Suddenly the string \naround the papers broke and the documents scattered on the ground. It \ntook them many minutes to put the packet together again, and by the time \nthey had reached the city gates, it was too late. \nWhen you force the pace out of fear and impatience, you create a nest \nof problems that require fixing, and you end up taking much longer than if \nyou had taken YOUf time. Hurriers may occasionally get there quicker, but \npapers fly everywhere, new dangers arise, and they find themselves in con­\nstant crisis mode, fixing the problems that they themselves have created . \nSometimes not acting in the face of danger is YOUf best move-you wait, \nyou deliberately slow down. As time passes it will eventually present op­\nportunities you had not imagined. \nWaiting involves controlling not only YOUf own emotions but those of \nYOUf colleague s, who, rnistaking action for power, may try to push you into \nmaking rash moves. In YOUf rivals, on the other hand, you can encourage \nthis same mistake : If you let them rush headlong into trouble while you \nstand back and wait, you will soon find ripe moments to intervene and pick \nup the pieces. This wise policy was the principal strategy of the great early­\nseventeenth-century emperor Tokugawa Ieyasu of Japan. When his prede­\ncessor, the headstrong Hideyoshi, whom he served as a general, staged a \nrash invasion of Korea, Ieyasu did not involve hirnself. He knew the inva­\nsion would be a dis aster and would lead to Hideyoshi's downfa ll. Better to \nstand patiently on the sidelines, even Jor many years, and then be in position \nto seize power when the time is right-exactly what Ieyasu did, with great \nartistry. \nYou do not delibera tely slow time down to live longer, or to take more \npleasUfe in the moment, but the better to play the game of power. First, \nwhen YOUf mind is uncluttered by constant emergencies you will see fur­\nther into the future. Second, you will be able to resist the baits that people \ndangle in front of you, and will keep yourself from becoming another im­\npatient sucker. Third, you will have more room to be flexible. Opportuni­\nties will inevitably arise that you had not expected and would have missed \nhad you forced the pace. Fourth, you will not move from one deal to the \nnext without completing the first one. To build your power's foundation \ncan take years; make sure that foundation is secure. Do not be a flash in the \npan-success that is built up slowly and surely is the only kind that lasts. \nFinally, slowing time down will give you a perspective on the times \nyou live in, letting you take a certain distance and putting you in a less \nemotionally charged position to see the shapes of things to come. Hurriers \nwill often mistake surface phenomena for a real trend, seeing only what \nthey want to see. How much better to see what is really happening, even if \nit is unpleasant or makes your task harder. \nForced Time. The trick in forcing time is to upset the timing of others-to \nmake them hurry, to make them wait, to make them abandon their own \npace, to distort their perception of time. Ey upsetting the timing of your op­\nponent while you stay patient, you open up time for yourself, which is half \nthe game. \nIn 1473 the great Turkish sultan Mehmed the Conqueror invited nego­\ntiations with Hungary to end the off-and-on war the two countries had \nwaged for years. When the Hungarian emissary arrived in Turkey to start \nthe talks, Turkish officials humbly apologized-Me hmed had just left Istan­\nbul, the capital, to battle his longtime foe, Uzun Hasan. Eut he urgently \nwanted peace with Hungary, and had asked that the emissary join hirn at \nthe front. \nWhen the emissary arrived at the site of the fighting, Mehmed had al­\nready left it, moving eastward in pursuit of his swift foe. This happened \nseveral times. Wherever the emissary stopped, the Turks lavished gifts and \nbanquets on hirn, in pleasurable but time-consuming ceremonies. Finally \nMehmed defeated Uzun and met with the emissary. Yet his terms for peace \nwith Hungary were excessively harsh. Mter a few days, the negotiations \nended, and the usual stalemate remained in place. Eut this was fine with \nMehmed. In fact he had planned it that way all along: Plotting his cam­\npaign against Uzun, he had seen that diverting his armies to the east would \nleave his western flank vulnerable. To prevent Hungary from taking advan­\ntage of his weakness and his preoccupation elsewhere, he first dangled the \nlure of peace before his enemy, then made them wait-all on his own \nterms. \nMaking people wait is a powerful way of forcing time, as long as they \ndo not figure out what you are up to. You control the dock, they linger in \nlimbo-and rapidly come unglued, opening up opportunities for you to \nstrike. The opposite effect is equally powerful : You make your opponents \nhurry. Start off your dealings with them slowly, then suddenly apply pres­\nsure, making them feel that everything is happening at once. People who \nlack the time to think will make mistakes-so set their deadlines for them. \nLAW 35 297 \n298 LAW 35 This was the technique Machiavelli admired in Cesare Borgia, who, during \nnegotiati ons, would suddenly press vehemendy for adecision, upsetting \nhis opponent's timing and patience. For who would dare make Cesare \nwait? \nJoseph Duveen, the famous art dealer, knew that if he gave an indeci­\nsive buyer like John D. Rockef eller a deadline -the painting had to leave \nthe country, another tycoon was int erested in it-the dient would buy just \nin time. Freud noticed that patients who had spent years in psychoa nalysis \nwithout improvement would miraculously recover just in time if he fixed a \ndefinite date for the end of the therapy. Jacques Lacan, the farnaus French \npsychoanalyst, used a variation on this tactic-he would sometimes end \nthe customary hour session of therapy after only ten minute s, without \nwaming. After this happened several times, the patient would realize that \nhe had better make maximum use of the time, rather than wasting much of \nthe hour with a lot of talk that meant nothing. The deadline, then, is a pow­\nerful tool. Close off the vistas of indecision and force people to make up \ntheir damn minds or get to the point-never let them make you play on \ntheir excruciating terms. Never give them time. \nMagicians and showmen are experts in forcing time. Houdini could \noften wriggle free of handcuffs in minute s, but he would draw the escape \nout to an hour, making the audience sweat, as time came to an apparent \nstandstill . Magicians have always known that the best way to alter our per­\nception of time is often to slow down the pace. Creating suspense brings \ntime to a terrifying pause: The slower the magicia n's hands move, the eas­\nier it is to create the illusion of speed, making people think the rabbit has \nappeared instantan eously. The great nineteenth-century magician Jean-Eu­\ngene Robert-Houdin took explicit notice of this effect: \"The more slowly a \nstory is told,\" he said, \"the shorter it seems.\" \nGoing slower also makes what you are doing more interest ing-the \naudience yields to your pace, becomes entranced. It is astate in which time \nwhizzes delightfully by. You must practice such illusions, which share in the \nhypnotist's power to alter perceptions of time. \nEnd Time. You can play the game with the utmost artistry-waiting pa­\ntiendy for the right moment to act, putting your competitors off their form \nby messing with their timing-but it won't mean a thing unless you know \nhow to finish. Da not be one of those people who look like paragons of pa­\ntience but are actually just afraid to bring things to a dose: Patience is \nworthless unless combined with a willing ness to fall ruthlessly on your op­\nponent at the right moment. You can wait as long as necessa ry for the con­\ndusion to come, but when it comes it must come quickly. Use speed to \nparalyze your opponent, cover up any mistakes you might make, and im­\npress people with your aura of authority and finality. \nWith the patience of a snake charmer, you draw the snake out with \ncalm and steady rhythms; Once the snake is out, though, would you dangle \nyour foot above its deadly head? There is never a good reason to allow the \nslightest hitch in your endgame. Your mastery of timing can really only be \njudged by how you work with end time-how you quickly change the pace \nand bring things to a swift and definitive conclusion. \nImage: The Hawk.

His ex­\nploits fascinated Americans-he seemed a man from another era, part \nRobin Hood, part Don Juan. After a few years of bitter fighting, however, \nGeneral Carranza emerged as the victor in the Revolution; the defeated \nVilla and his troops went back horne, to the northem state of Chihuahua. \nHis army dwindled and he tumed to banditry again, damaging his popu­\nlarity. Finally, perhaps out of desperation, he began to rail against the \nUnited States, the gringos, whom he blamed for his troubles. \nIn March of 1916, Pancho Villa raided Columbus, New Mexico. Ram­\npaging through the town, he and his gang killed seventeen American sol­\ndiers and civilians. President Woodrow Wilson, like many Americans, had \nadmired Villa; now, however, the bandit needed to be punished. Wilson's \nadvisers urged hirn to send troops into Mexico to capture Villa. For a \npower as large as the United States, they argued, not to strike back at an \narmy that had invaded its territory would send the worst kind of signal. \nFurtherm ore, they continued, many Americans saw Wilson as a pacifist, a \nprinciple the public doubted as a response to violence; he needed to prove \nhis mettle and manliness by ordering the use of force. \nThe pressure on Wilson was strong, and before the month was out, \nwith the approval of the Carranza govemment, he sent an army of ten \nthousand soldiers to capture Pancbo Villa. The venture was called the \nPunitive Expedition, and its leader was the dashing General John J. Persh­\ning, who had defeated guerrillas in the Philippines and Native Americans \nin the American Southwe st. Certainly Pershing could find and overpower \nPancho Villa. \nThe Punitive Expedition became a sensational story, and carloads of \nU.S. reporters followed Pershing into action. The campaign, they wrote, \nwould be a test of American power. The soldiers carried the latest in \nweaponry, communicated by radio, and were supported by reconnais­\nsance from the air. \nIn the first few months, the troops split up into small units to comb the \nwilds of northem Mexico. The Americans offered a $50,000 reward for in­\nformation leading to Villa's capture . But the Mexican people, who had \nbeen disillusioned with Villa when he had retumed to banditry, now idol­\nized hirn for facing this mighty American army. They began to give Persh­\ning false leads: Villa had been seen in this village, or in that mountain \nhideaway, airplanes would be dispatc bed, troops would scurry after them, \nand no one would ever see hirn. The wily bandit seemed to be always one \nstep ahead of the American military. \nBy the summer of that year, the expedition had swelled to 123,000 \nmen.

As \nthe troops made their way back to American territory, rebel forces pursued \nthem, forcing the US. Army to use airplan es to protect its rear flanks. The \nPunitive Expedition was being punished itself-it had turned into a retreat \nof the most humiliating sort. \nInterpretation \nWoodrow Wilson organized the Punitive Expedition as a show of force: He \nwould teach Pancho Villa a lesson and in the process show the world that \nno one, large or small, could attack the mighty United States and get away \nwith it. The expedition would be over in a few weeks, and Villa would be \nforgotten. \nThat was not how it played out. The longer the expedition took, the \nmore it focused attention on the Americans' incompetence and on Villa's \ncleverness_ Soon what was forgotten was not Villa but the raid that had \nstarted it all. As a minor annoyance became an international embarrass­\nment, and the enraged Americans dispatched more troops, the imbalance \nbetween the size of the pursuer and the size of the pursued -who still man­\naged to stay free-made the affair a joke.

He could have organized a trap on the Ameri­\ncan side of the border, anticipating the next raid. Or he could have ignored \nthe matter altogether for the time being, waiting for the Mexicans them­\nselves to do away with Villa of their own accord. \nRemember: You choose to let things bother you_ You can just as easily \nchoose not to notice the irritating offender, to consider the matter trivial \nand unworthy of your interest.

Catherine had failed to pro­\nduce a son, a male heir who would ensure the continuance of his dynasty, \nand Henry thought he knew why: He had read in the Bible the passage, \n\"And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing: he hath \nuncovered his brother 's nakedness; they shall be childless.\" Before marry­\ning Henry, Catherine had married his older brother Arthur, but Arthur \nhad died five months later. Henry had waited an appropriate time, then \nhad married his brother' s widow. \nCatherine was the daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of \nSpain, and by marrying her Henry had kept alive a valuable alliance. Now, \nhowever, Catherine had to assure hirn that her brief marriage with Arthur \nhad never been consummate d. Otherw ise Henry would view their rela­\ntionship as incestuous and their marriage as null and void. Catherine in­\nsisted that she had remained a virgin through her marriage to Arthur, and \nPope Clement VII supported her by giving his blessing to the union, which \nhe could not have done had he considered it incestuous. Yet after years of \nmarriage to Henry, Catherine had failed to produce a son, and in the early \n1520s she had entered menopause. To the king this could only mean one \nthing: She had lied about her virginity, their union was incestuous, and \nGod had punished them. \nThere was another reason why Henry wanted to get rid of Catherin e: \nHe had fallen in love with a younger woman, Anne Boleyn. Not only was \nhe in love with her, but if he married her he could still hope to sire a legiti­\nmate son. The marriage to Catherine had to be annulled. For this, how­\never, Henry had to apply to the Vatican. But Pope Clement would never \nannul the marriage . \nBy the summer of 1527, rumors spread throughout Europe that Henry \nwas about to attempt the impossible -to annul his marriage against \nClement' s wishes. Catherine would never abdicate, let alone voluntarily \nenter a nunnery, as Henry had urged her. But Henry had his own strategy: \nHe stopped sleeping in the same bed with Catherin e, since he considered \nher his sister-in-Iaw, not his lawful wife. He insisted on calling her Princess the dais where the chief \nwas seated and lay \nthere, chewing its cud. \nEveryone was sure that \nthis was some grave \nportent. and urged that \nthe ox be sent to a yin­\nyang diviner. However. \nthe prime minister, the \nfather ofthe minister of \nthe right, said, \"An ox \nhas no discrimination. \nIt has legs-there is \nnowhere it won't go. It \ndoes not make sense to \ndeprive an underpaid \nofficial of the wretched \nox he needs in order to \nattend court.\" He \nreturned the ox to its \nowner and changed the \nmaUing on which it had \nlain.

Henry not only ignored this threat, \nhe insisted that his marriage to Catherine had been dissolved, and in 1533 \nhe married Anne Boleyn. \nClement refused to recognize the marriage, but Henry did not care. \nHe no longer recognized the pope's authority, and proceeded to break \nwith the Roman Catholic Church, establishing the Church of England in \nits stead, with the king as the head of the new church.

Henry had humiliated hirn and he had no power of recourse. \nEven excommunication (which he constantly threaten ed but never carried \nout) would no longer matter. \nCatherine too feit the devastating sting of Henry' s disdain. She tried to \nfight back, but in appealing to Henry her words fell on deaf ears, and soon \nthey fell on no one's. Isolated from the court, ignored by the king, mad \nwith anger and frustrati on, Catherine slowly deteriorate d, and finally died \nin January of 1536, from a cancerous tumor ofthe heart. \nInterpretation \nWhen you pay attention to aperson, the two of you become partners of \nsorts, each moving in step to the actions and reactions of the other. In the \nprocess you lose your initiativ e. It is a dynamic of all interactio ns: By ac­\nknowledging other people, even if only to fight with them, you open your­\nself to their influence. Had Henry locked horns with Catherine, he would \nhave found hirnself mired in endless arguments that would have weakened \nhis resolve and eventua lly worn rum down. (Catherine was a strong, stub­\nborn woman.) Had he set out to convince Clement to change rus verdict on \nthe marriage 's validity, or tried to compromise and negotiate with hirn, he \nwould have gotten bogged down in Clement's favorite tactic: playing for \ntime, promising flexibility, but actually getting what popes always got­\ntheir way. \nHenry would have none of this. He played a devastating power \ngame-total disdain. By ignoring people you cancel them out. This unset­\ntles and infuriates them-but since they have no dealings with you, there is \nno thing they can do. \nThis is the offensive aspect of the law. Playing the card of contempt is \nimmensely powerful, for it lets you determine the conditions of the conflict. \nThe war is waged on your terms. This is the ultimate power pose: You are \nthe king, and you ignore what offends you. Watch how this tactic infuriates \npeople -half of what they do is to get your attention, and when you with­\nhold it from them, they flounder in frustration. \nMAN: Kick him-he'll jor{ljve you. Flatter him-he may or may not \nsee through you. But ignore him and he'll hate you. \nIdries Shah, Caravan of Dreams, 1968 \nKEYS TO POWER \nDesire often creates paradoxical effects: The more you want somet hing, \nthe more you chase after it, the more it eludes you. The more interest you \nshow, the more you repel the object of your desire. This is because your in­\nterest is too strong-it makes people awkward, even fearful. Uncontrol­\nlable desire makes you seem weak, unworthy, pathetic. \nYou need to turn YOUf back on what you want, show your contempt \nand disdain. This is the kind of powerful response that will drive your tar­\ngets crazy. They will respond with adesire of their own, which is simply to \nhave an effect on you-perhaps to possess you, perhaps to hurt you. If they \nwant to possess you, you have successfully completed the first step of se­\nduction. If they want to hurt you, you have unsettled them and made them \nplay by your rules (see Laws 8 and 39 on baiting people into action). \nContempt is the prerogative of the king. Where his eyes turn, what he \ndecides to see, is what has reality; what he ignores and turns his back on is \nas good as dead. That was the weapon of King Louis XIV -if he did not \nlike you, he acted as if you were not there, maintaining his superiority by \ncutting off the dynamic of interaction. This is the power you have when \nyou play the card of contempt, periodically showing people that you can \ndo without them. \nIf choosing to ignore enhances your power, it follows that the opposite \napproach-c ommitment and engagement-often weakens you. By paying \nundue attention to a puny enemy, you look puny, and the longer it takes \nyou to crush such an enemy, the larger the enemy seems. When Athens set \nout to conquer the island of Sicily, in 415 B.C., a giant power was attacking a \ntiny one. Yet by entangling Athens in a long-drawn- out conflict, Syracuse, \nSicily's most important city-state, was ahle to grow in stature and confi­\ndeuce. Finally defeating Athens, it made itself famous for centuries to \ncorne. In recent times, President John F. Kennedy made a similar mistake \nin his attitude to Fidel Castro of Cuha: His failed invasion at the Bay of \nPigs, in 1961, made Castro an international hero. \nA second danger: If you succeed in crushing the irritant, or even if you \nmerely wound it, you create sympathy for the weaker side. Critics of \nFranklin D. Roosevelt complained bitterly about the money his adminis­\ntration spent on government projects, hut their attacks had no resonance \nwith the puhlic, who saw the president as working to end the Great De­\npression. His opponents thought they had an example that would show just \nhow wasteful he had hecome: his dog, Fala, which he Iavished with favors \nand attention.

This was the unit that later broke into \nDemocratic Party offices in the Watergate Hotel, setting off the chain of \nevents that led to Nixon's downfall. In reality the publication of the Penta­\ngon Papers was not a serious threat to the administration, but Kissinger's \nreaction made it a big deal. In trying to fix one problem, he created an­\nother: a paranoia for security that in the end was much more destruct ive to \nthe government Had he ignored the Pentagon Papers, the scandal they \nhad created would eventually have blown over, \nInstead of inadvertently focusing attention on a problem, making it \nseem worse by publicizing how much concern and anxiety it is causing \nyou, it is often far wiser to play the contemptuous aristocrat, not deigning \nto ackn owledge the problem's existence, There are several ways to execute \nthis strategy. \nFirst there is the sour-gra pes approach. If there is something you want \nbut that you realize you cannot have, the worst thing you can do is draw at­\ntention to your disappointrnent by complaining about it An infinitely \nmore powerful tactic is to act as if it never really interested you in the first \nplace. When the writer George Sand's supporters nominated her to be the \nfirst female member of the Academie Fran(,:aise, in 1861, Sand quickly saw \nthat the academy would never admit her. Instead of whining, though, she \nclaimed she had no interest in belong ing to this group of worn-out, over­\nrated, out-of-touch windbags. Her disdain was the perfect response: Had \nshe shown her anger at her exclusion, she would have revealed how much \nit meant to her. Instead she branded the academy a club of old men-and \nwhy should she be angry or disappointed at not having to spend her time \nwith them? Crying \"sour grapes\" is sometimes seen as a reflection of the \nweak; it is actually the tactic of the powerful. \nSecond, when you are attacked by an inferior, deflect people's atten­\ntion by making it clear that the attack has not even registered. Look away, \nor answer sweetly, showing how little the attack concerns you. Similarly, \nwhen you yourself have committed ablunder, the best response is often to \nmake less of your mistake by treating it lightly. \nThe Japanese emperor Go-Saiin, a great disciple of the tea ceremony, \nowned a priceless antique tea bowl that all the courtiers envied. One day a \nguest, Dainagon Tsunehiro, asked if he could carry the tea bowl into the \nlight, to examine it more closely. The bowl rarely left the table, but the em­\nperor was in good spirits and he consented. As Dainagon carried the bowl \nto the railing of the verandah, however, and held it up to the light, it \nslipped from his hands and fell on a rock in the garden below, smashing \ninto tiny fragm ents. \nThe emperor of course was furious. \"It was indeed most clumsy of me \nto let it drop in this way, \" said Dainagon, with a deep bow, \"but really \nthere is not much harm done. This Ido tea-bowl is a very old one and it is \nimpossible to say how much longer it would have lasted, but anyh ow it is \nnot a thing of any public use, so I think it rather fortunate that it has broken \nthus .\" This surprising response had an immediate effect: The emperor \ncalmed down. Dainagon neither sniveled nor overa pologized, but signa led \nhis own worth and power by treating his mistake with a touch of disdain. \nThe emperor had to respond with a similar aristocratic indifference; his \nanger had made hirn seem low and petty-an image Dainagon was able to \nmanipulate . \nAmong equals this tactic might backfire : Your indifference could make \nyou seem callous. Eut with a master, if you act quickly and without great \nfuss, it can work to great effect: You bypass his angry response, save hirn \nthe time and energy he would waste by brooding over it, and allow hirn the \nopportunity to display his own lack of pettin ess publicly. \nIf we make excuses and denials when we are caught in am istake or a \ndecepti on, we stir the waters and make the situation worse. It is often wiser \nto play things the opposite way. The Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino \noften boasted of his aristocrati c linea ge, which was, of course, a fiction, \nsince he was actually the son of a shoem aker. When an enemy of his finally \nreve aled the embarrassing truth , word quickly spread, and soon all of \nVenice (where he lived at the time) was aghast at Aretino's lies. Had he \ntried to defend hirnself , he would have only dragge d hirnself down. His re­\nsponse was master ful: He announced that he was indeed the son of a shoe­\nmaker, but this only proved his great ness, since he had risen from the \nlowest stratum of society to its very pinnacl e. From then on he never men­\ntioned his previous lie, trumpeting instead his new position on the matter \nof his ance stry. \nRememb er: The powerful responses to niggling, petty annoyances and \nirrita tions are contempt and disdain.

He performed his miracles in an \nenormous converted beer hall, outside which Berliners began to notice \never longer lines of people-the blind, the lame, anyone with an illness in­\ncurable by normal medici ne. When it leaked out that the doctor worked by \nexposing the patient to the rays of the mo on, he soon became dubbed The \nMoon Doctor of Berlin. \nSometime in 1783, it was reported that Dr. Weisleder had cured a well­\nto-do woman of a terrible ailment. He suddenly became a celebrity. Previ­\nously only the poorest Berliners had been seen waiting outside the beer \nhall in their rags; now magnificent carriages were parked outside, and gen­\ntlemen in frock coats, and ladies with enormous coiffures, lined the street \nas sunset drew near. Even folk with the mildest of ailments came, out of \nsheer curiosity. As they waited in line, the poorer clients would explain to \nthe gentlemen and ladies that the doctor only practiced when the moon \nwas in its incre scent phase. Many would add that they themselves had al­\nready been exposed to the healing powers he called forth from the rays of \nthe moon. Even those who feIt cured kept coming back, drawn by this \npowerful experie nce. \nInside the beer hall, astrange and stirring spectacle greeted the visitor: \nPacked into the entrance hall was a crowd of all classes and ethnic back­\ngrounds, a veritable Tower of Babel. Through tall windows on the northern \nside of the hall, silvery moonlight poured in at odd angles. The doctor and \nhis wife, who, it seemed, was also able to effect the cure, practiced on the \nsecond floor, which was reached by a stairway, at the end of the hall. As the \nline edged closer to the stairs, the sick would hear shouts and cries from \nabove, and word would spread of, perhaps, a blind gentleman suddenly \nable to see. \nOnce upstairs, the line would fork in two directio ns, toward a north­\nem room for the doctor, a southem one for his wife, who worked only on \nthe ladies. Finally, after hours of anticipation and waiting in line, the gen­\ntlemen patients would be led before the amazing doctor hirnself, an el­\nderly man with a few stalks of wild gray hair and an air of nervous energy. \nHe would take the patient (let us say a young boy, brought in by his fa­\nther), uncover the afflicted body part, and lift the boy up to the window, \nwhich faced the light of the moon. He would rub the site of the injury or \nillness, mumble something unintellig ible, look knowingly at the mo on, \nand then, after collecting his fee, send the boy and his father on their way. \nMeanwhil e, in the south-facing room, his wife would be doing the same \nwith the ladies-which was odd, really, since the moon cannot appear in \ntwo places at once; it cannot have been visible, in other words, from both \nwindows. Apparently the mere thought, idea, and symbol of the moon \nwere enough, for the ladies did not complain, and would later remark \nconfidently that the wife of the Moon Doctor had the same healing powers \nas he. \nInterpretation \nDr. Weisleder may have known nothing about medicine , but he under­\nstood human nature. Re recognized that people do not always want words, \nor rational explanat ions, or demonstrations of the powers of science; they \nwant an immediate appeal to their emotions. Give them that and they will \ndo the rest-such as imagine they can be healed by the light reflected from \na rock a quarter million miles away. Dr. Weisleder had no need of pills, or \noflengthy lectures on the moon's power, or of any silly gadgetry to amplify \nits rays. Re understood that the simpler the spectacle the better-just the \nmoonlight pouring in from the side, the stairway leading to the heavens, \nand the rays of the mo on, whether directly visible or not. Any added ef­\nfects might have made it seem that the moon was not strong enough on its \nown. And the moon was strong enough-it was a magnet far fantasies, as it \nhas been throughout history. Simply by associa ting hirnself with the image \nof the moon, the doctor gained power. \nRemember: Your search for power depends on shortcu ts. You must al­\nways circumvent people's suspicions, their perverse desire to resist your \nwill. Images are an extremely effective shortcut: Bypassing the head, the \nseat of doubt and resistance, they aim straight for the heart. Overwhelming \nthe eyes, they create powernd associations, bringing people together and \nstirring their emotions. With the white light of the moon in their eyes, your \ntargets are blinded to the deceptions you practice. \nOBSER VANCE OF TRE LAW 11 \nIn 1536 the future king Renri 11 of France took his first mistress, Diane de \nPoitiers. Diane was thirty-seven at the time, and was the widow of the \ngrand seneschal of Normandy. Renri, meanwhile, was a sprightly lad of \nseventeen, who was just beginning to sow his wild oats. At first their union \nseemed merely platonic, with Renri showing an intensely spiritual devo­\ntion to Diane. But it so on became clear that he loved her in every way, pre­\nferring her bed to that of his young wife, Catherine de' Medicis. \nIn 1547 King Francis died and Renri ascended to the throne. This new \nsituation posed perils for Diane de Poitiers. She had just tumed forty-eight, \nand despite her notorious cold baths and rumored youth potions, she was \nbeginning to show her age; now that Renri was king, perhaps he would re­\nturn to the queen's bed, and do as other kings had done--choose mis­\ntresses from the bevy of beauties who made the French court the envy of \nEurope. Re was, after all, only twenty-eight, and cut a dashing figure. But \nDiane did not give up so easily. She would continue to enthrall her lover, \nas she had enthralled hirn for the past eleven years. \nDiane's secret weapons were symbols and images, to which she had al­\nways paid great attention. Early on in her relationship with Renri, she had \ncreated a motif by intertwining her initials with his, to symbolize their \nunion. The idea worked like acharm: Renri put this insignia everywhere-­\non his royal robes, on monuments , on churches, on the facade of the where Antony awaited \nthe queen enthroned on \nhis tribunal, unti! at last \nhe was left sitting quite \nalone. And the word \nspread on every side \nthat Aphrodite had \ncome to revel with \nDionysus for the \nhappiness of Asia. \nAntony then sent a \nmessage inviting \nCleopatra to dine with \nhim. But she thought it \nmore appropriate that \nhe should come to her, \nand so, as he wished to \nshow his courtesy and \ngoodwill, he accepted \nand went. He found the \npreparations made to \nreceive him magnificent \nbey(md words, but \nwhat astonished him \nmost of all was the \nextraordinary number \nof lights. 50 many of \nthese, it is said, were let \ndown from the roof \nand displayed on all \nsides at once, and they \nwere arranged and \ngrouped in such inge­\nnious patterns in rela­\ntion to each other, some \nin squares and some in \neire/es, that they created \nas brilliant a spectae/e \nas can ever have been \ndevised to delight \nthe eye. \nLlFE OF ANTONY. \nPLlJTARCH, \nC.

Diane's favorite colors were black \nand white, which she wore exclusively, and wherever it was possible the in­\nsignia appeared in these colors. Everyone recognized the symbol and its \nmeaning. Soon after Renri took the throne, however, Diane went still fur­\nther: She decided to identify herself with the Roman goddess Diana, her \nnamesake. Diana was the goddess of the hunt, the traditional royal pastime \nand the particular passion of Renri. Equally important, in Renaissance art \nshe symbolized chastity and purity. For a woman like Diane to identify her­\nself with this goddess would instantly call up those images in the court, giv­\ning her an air of respectability. Symbolizing her \"chaste\" relationship with \nRenri, it would also set her apart from the adulterous liaisons of royal mis­\ntresses past. \nTo effect this association, Diane began by completely transforming her \ncastle at Anet. She razed the building's structure and in its place erected a \nmagnificent Doric-colum ned edifice modeled after a Roman temple. It was \nmade in white Normandy stone flecked with black silex, reproducing \nDiane's trademark colors of black and white. The insignia of her and \nRenri's initials appeared on the columns, the doors, the windows, the car­\npet. Meanwhile, symbols of Diana-crescent moons, stags, and hounds­\nadorned the gates and facade. Inside, enormous tapestries depicting \nepisodes in the life of the goddess lay on the floors and hung on the walls. \nIn the garden stood the famous Goujon sculpture Diane Chasseresse, which is \nnow in the Louvre, and which had an uncanny resemblance to Diane de \nPoitiers. Paintings and other depictions of Diana appeared in every corner \nof the castle. \nAnet overwhelmed Renri, who soon was trumpeting the image of \nDiane de Poitiers as a Roman goddess. In 1548, when the couple appeared \ntogether in Lyons for a royal celebration, the townspeople welcomed them \nwith a tableau vivant depicting a scene with Diana the huntress. France's \ngreatest poet of the period, Pierre de Ronsard, began to write verses in \nhonor of Diana-indeed a kind of cult of Diana sprang up, all inspired by \nthe king's mistress. It seemed to Renri that Diane had given herself a kind \nof divine aura, and as if he were destined to worship her for the rest of his \nlife. And until his death, in 1559, he did remain faithful to her-making her \na duchess, giving her untold wealth, and displaying an almost religious de­\nvotion to his first and only mistress. \nInterpretation \nDiane de Poitiers, a woman from a modest bourgeois background, man­\naged to captivate Renri for over twenty years. By the time he died she was \nweH into her sixties, yet his passion for her only increased with the years. \nShe knew the king well. Re was not an inteHectual but a lover of the out­\ndoors-he particularly loved jousting tournaments, with their bright pen­\nnants, brilliantly caparisoned horses, and beautifully dressed women. \nRenri's love of visual splendor seemed childlike to Diane, and she played \non this weakness of his at every opportunity. \nMost astute of all was Diane's appropriation of the goddess Diana. \nHere she took the game beyond physical imagery into the realm of the psy­\nchic symbol. It was quite a feat to transform a king's mistress into an em­\nblem of power and purity, but she managed it. Without the resonance of \nthe goddess, Diane was merely anaging courtesan. With the imagery and \nsymbolism of Diana on her shoulders, she seemed a mythic force, destined \nfor greatness. \nYou too can play with images like these, weaving visual clues into an \nencompassing gestalt, as Diane did with her colors and her insignia. Estab­\nlish a trademark like these to set yourself apart. Then take the game fur­\nther: Find an image or symbol from the past that will neatly fit your \nsituation, and put it on your shoulders like a cape. It will make you seem \nlarger than life. \nBecause of the light it shines on the other stars which make up a kind of \ncourt around it, because of the just and equal distr ibution of its mys to \nalt alike, because of the good it bring s to alt places, producing life, joy \nand action, because of its cons tancy from which it never varies, I chose \nthe sun as the most magnifi cent image to repres ent a great leader. \nLouis XlV, the Sun King, 1638-1715 \nKEYS TO POWER \nUsing words to plead your case is risky business: Words are dangerous in­\nstruments, and often go astray.

It also happens that words offend us, stirring up asso­\nciations unintended by the speaker. \nThe visual, on the other hand, short-circuits the labyrinth of words. It \nstrikes with an emotional power and immediacy that leave no gaps for re­\nflection and doubt. Like music, it leaps right over rational, reasonable \nthoughts. Imagine the Moon Doctor trying to make a case for his medical \npractice, trying to convince the unconverted by telling them about the \nhealing powers of the moon, and about his owo special connection to a dis­\ntant object in the sky. Fortunately for hirn, he was able to create a com­\npelling spectacle that made words unneces sary. The moment his patients \nentered the beer hall, the image of the moon spoke eloquently enough. \nUnderstand: Words put you on the defensi ve. If you have to explain \nyourself your power is already in question. The image, on the other hand, \nimposes itself as a given. It discourages questio ns, creates forcehll associa ­\ntions, resists unintended interpreta tions, communicates instantly, and \nforges bonds that transcend social differences. Words stir up arguments \nand divisions; images bring people together. They are the quintessential in­\nstruments of power. \nThe symbol has the same force, whether it is visual (the statue of There was a man \nnamed Sakamot oya \nHechigwan who lived \nin upper Kyoto .... \nWhen [Emperor] \nHideyoshi gave his \ngreat Cha-no-yu [tea \nceremony] meeting at \nKitano in the tenth \nmonth of 1588, Hechig­\nwan set up a great red \numbrella nine feet \nacross mounted on a \nstick seven feet high. \nThe circumference of \nthe handle he \nsurraunded for about \ntwo feet by a reed fence \nin such a way that the \nrays of the sun were \nrefiected fram it and \ndiffused the colour of \nthe umbrella all \naround. This device \npleased Hideyoshi so \nmuch that he remitted \nHechigwan 's taxes as a \nreward. \nCHA-NO-YU: \nTHE JAPANESE TEA \nCEREM ONY, \nA. L. SADLER, \n1962 \nLAW 37 313 \n314 LAW 37 Diana) or a verbal description of something visual (the words \"the Sun \nKing\"). The symbolic object stands for something else, something abstract \n(such as the image \"Diana\" standing for chastity). The abstract concept­\npurity, patriotism, courage, love-is full of emotional and powerful associa­\ntions. The symbol is a shortcut of expression, containing dozens of \nmeanings in one simple phrase or object. The symbol of the Sun King, as \nexplained by Louis XIV, can be read on many layers, but the beauty of it is \nthat its associations required no explanation, spoke immediately to his sub­\njects, distinguished him from allother kings, and conjured up a kind of \nmajesty that went far beyond the words themselves. The symbol contains \nuntold power. \nThe first step in using symbols and images is to understand the pri­\nmacy of sight among the senses. Before the Renaissance, it has been ar­\ngued, sight and the other senses-taste, touch, and so on-operated on a \nrelatively equal plane. Since then, however, the visual has come to domi­\nnate the others, and is the sense we most depend on and trust. As Graciän \nsaid, \"The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.\" When the Renaissance \npainter Fra Filippo Lippi was a captured slave among the Moors, he won \nhis freedom by sketching a drawing of his master on a white wall with a \npiece of charcoal; when the owner saw the drawing, he instantly under­\nstood the power of a man who could make such images, and let Fra Lippi \ngo. That one image was far more powerful than any argument the artist \ncould have made with words. \nNever neglect the way you arrange things visually. Factors like color, \nfor example, have enormous symbolic resonance . When the con artist Yel­\nlow Kid Weil created a newsletter touting the phony stocks he was ped­\ndling, he called it the \"Red Letter Newsletter\" and had it printed, at \nconsiderable expense, in red ink. The color created a sense of urgency, \npower, and good fortune. Weil recognized details like these as keys to de­\nception-as do modem advertisers and mass-market ers. If you use \"gold\" \nin the title of anything you are trying to sell, for example, print it in gold. \n. Since the eye predominates, people will respond more to the color than to \ntheword. \nThe visual contains great emotional power. The Roman emperor Con­\nstantine worshipped the sun as a god for most of his life; one day, though, \nhe looked up at the sun, and saw a cross superimp osed on it. The vision of \nthe cross over the sun proved to hirn the ascendancy of the new religion, \nand he converted not just hirnself but the whole Roman Empire to Chris­\ntianity soon thereafter. All the preaching and proselytizing in the world \ncould not have been as powerful . Find and associate yourself with the im­\nages and symbols that will communicate in this immediate way today, and \nyou will have untold power. \nMost effective of all is a new combination-a fusion of images and sym­\nbols that have not been seen together before, but that through their associ­\nation clearly demonstrate your new idea, message, religion. The creation of \nnew images and symbols out of old ones in this way has a poetic effect­\nviewers' associations run rampant, giving them a sense of participat ion. \nVisual images often appear in a sequence, and the order in which they \nappear creates a symbol. The first to appear, for instance, symboliz es \npower; the image at the center seems to have central importance. \nNear the end of World War 11, orders came down from General Eisen­\nhower that American troops were to lead the way into Paris after its liber­\nation from the Nazis. The French general Charles de Gaulle, however, \nrealized that this sequence would imply that the Americans now com­\nmanded the fate of France. Through much manipulation, de Gaulle made \ncertain that he and the French Second Armored Division would appear at \nthe head of the liberating force. The strategy worked: After he had success­\nfuHy pulled off this stunt, the Allies started treating hirn as the new leader \nof an independent France. De Gaulle knew that aleader has to locate him­\nself literally at the head of his troops. This visual association is crucial to the \nemotional response that he needs to elicit. \nThings change in the game of symbols: It is probably no longer possi­\nble to pose as a \"sun king,\" or to wrap the mantIe of Diana around you. Yet \nyou can associate yourself with such symbols more indirectIy. And, of \ncourse, you can make your own mythology out of figures from more re­\ncent history, people who are comfortably dead but still powerfully associa­\ntive in the public eye. The idea is to give yourself an aura, astature that \nyour normal banal appearance simply will not create. By herself Diane de \nPoitiers had no such radiant powers; she was as human and ordinary as \nmost of uso But the symbol elevated her above the human lot, and made \nher seem divine. \nUsing symbols also has a courtier-like effect, since they are often gen­\ntIer than brutish words. The psychotherapist Dr. Milton H. Erickson al­\nways tried to find symbols and images that would communicate to the \npatient in ways that words could not. When dealing with a severely trou­\nbied patient, he would not question hirn directIy but would talk about \nsomething irrelevant, such as driving through the desert in Arizona, where \nhe practiced in the 1950s. In describing this he would eventually come to \nan appropriate symbol for what he suspected was the man's problem. Ifhe \nfeIt the patient was isolated, say, Dr. Erickson would talk of a single iron­\nwood tree, and how its isolation left it battered by the winds. Making an \nemotional connection with the tree as a symbol, the patient would open up \nmore readily to the doctor's probing. \nUse the power of symbols as a way to rally, animate, and unite your \ntroops or team. During the rebellion against the French crown in 1648, \nthose loyal to the king disparaged the rebels by comparing them to the \nslingshots (in French,frondes) that littIe boys use to frighten big boys. Cardi­\nnal de Retz decided to turn this disparaging term into the rebels' symbol: \nThe uprising was now known as the Fronde, and the rebels as frondeurs. \nThey began to wear sashes in their hats that symbolized the slingshot, and \nthe word became their rallying cry. Without it the rebellion might weIl \nhave petered out. Always find a symbol to represent your cause-the more \nemotional associations, the better. \nThe best way to use images and symbols is to organize them into a \nLAW 37 315 \n316 LAW 37 grand spectacle that awes people and distracts them from unpleasant reali­\nties. This is easy to do: People love what is grand, spectacular, and larger \nthan life. Appeal to their emotions and they will flock to YOUf spectacle in \nhordes. The visual is the easiest route to their hearts. \nREVERSAL Image: \nThe Cross and the \nSun. Crucifixion and \ntotal radiance.

The city-states of Greece had \nrecently fought off a mighty invasion from Persia, and now Pausanias, \nalong with alli ed ships from Athens, had orders to punish the invaders and \nwin back the islands and coastal towns that the Persians had occupied. \nBoth the Athenians and the Spartans had great respect for Pau sani as-he \nhad proven hirnself as a fearless warr ior, with a flair for the dramatic. \nWith amazing speed, Pau sanias and his troops took Cyp rus, then \nmoved on to the mainland of Asia Minor known as the Helle spont and \ncaptured Byzantium (modem-day Istanbul) . Now master of part of the Per­\nsian empire, Pausanias began to show signs of behavior that went beyond \nhis normal flamboyance . He appeared in public wearing pomades in his \nhair and flowing Persian robes, and accompanied by a bodyguard of Egyp­\ntians. He held lavish banquets in which he sat in the Persian manner and \ndemanded to be entertain ed. He stopped seeing his old friends, entered \ninto communication with the Persian King Xerxes, and all in all affected \nthe style and manner of a Persian dictator. \nClearly power and success had gone to Pau sanias 's head. His army­\nAthenians and Spartans alike-at first thought this a passing fancy: He had \nalways been a bit exaggerated in his gesture s. But when he flaunted his dis­\ndain for the Greeks' simple way of life, and insulted the common Greek \nsoldier, they began to feel he had gone too far. Although there was no con­\ncrete evidence for this, rumors spread that he had gone over to the other \nside, and that he dreamed of becoming a kind of Greek Xerxes. To quell \nthe pos sibility of mutiny, the Spartans relieved Pau sanias of his command \nand called hirn horne. \nPau sanias , however, continued to dress in the Persian style, even in \nSparta. After a few months he independently hired a trireme and retumed \nto the Helle spont, telling his compatriots he was going to continue the fight \nagainst the Persians. Actuall y, however, he had different plans-to make \nhirnself ruler of all Greece, with the aid of Xerxes hirnself. The Spartans \ndedared hirn a public enemy and sent a ship to capture hi rn. Pau sanias sur­\nrendered, certain that he could dear hirnself of the charges of treason. It \ndid come out during the trial that during his reign as commander he had \noffended his fellow Greeks time and agai n, erecting monuments , for in­\nstance, in his own name, rather than in those of the cities whose troops had \nfought alongside hirn, as was the custom. Yet Pausanias proved right: De­\nspite the evidence of his numerous contacts with the enemy, the Spartans \nrefused to imprison a man of such noble birth, and let hirn go. \nNow thinking hirnself untouchable, Pausanias hired a messenger to \ntake a letter to Xerxes, but the messenger instead took the letter to the \nSpartan authorities. These men wanted to find out more, so they had the \nmessenger arrange to meet Pausanias in atempIe where they could hide \nand listen behind a parti tion. What Pau sanias said shocked them-they \nhad never heard such contempt for their ways spoken so brazenly by one \nof their own-and they made arrangements for his immediate arrest. \nOn his way horne from the temple, Pausanias got word of what had \nhappened. He ran to another temple to hide, but the authorities followed \nhim there and placed sentries all around. Pausanias refused to surrender. \nUnwilling to forcibly remove hirn from the sacred temple, the authorities \nkept hirn trapped inside, until he eventually died of starvation. \nInterpretation \nAt first glance it might seem that Pausanias simply fell in love with another \nculture, a phenomenon as old as time. Never comfortable with the asceti­\ncism of the Spartans, he found hirnself enthralled by the Persian love of \nluxury and sensual pleasure. He put on Persian robes and perfumes with a \nsense of deliverance from Greek discipline and simplicity. \nThis is how it appears when people adopt a culture in which they were \nnot raised. Often, however, there is also something else at play: People \nwho flaunt their infatuation with a different culture are expressing a dis­\ndain and contempt for their own. They are using the outward appearance \nof the exotic to separate themselves from the common folk who unques­\ntioningly follow the local customs and laws, and to express their sense of \nsuperiority. Otherwise they would act with more dignity, showing respect \nfor those who do not share their desires. Indeed their need to show their \ndifference so dramatically often makes them disliked by the people whose \nbeliefs they challenge, indirectly and subtly, perhaps, but offensively \nnonetheless. \nAs Thucydides wrote of Pausanias, \"By his contempt for the laws and \nhis imitation of foreign ways he had made hirnself very widely suspected of \nbeing unwilling to abide by normal standards.\" Cultures have norms that \nreflect centuries of shared beliefs and ideals. Do not expect to scoff at such \nthings with impunity. You will be punished somehow, even if just through \nisolation-a position of real powerlessne ss. \nMany of us, like Pausanias, feel the siren call of the exotic, the foreign. \nMeasure and moderate this desire. Flaunting your pleasure in alien ways of \nthinking and acting will reveal a different motive--to demonstrate your su­\nperiority over your fellows. \nOBSER VANCE OF THE LAW \nDuring the late sixteenth century, a violent reaction against the Protestant \nReformation erupted in Italy. The Counter-Reformation, as it was called, \nincluded its own version of the Inquisition to root out all deviations from \nthe Catholic Church. Among its victims was the scientist Galileo, but an \nimportant thinker who suffered even greater persecution was the Domini­\ncan monk and philosopher Tommaso Campanella. \nA follower of the materia list doctrine of the Roman philosopher Epi­\ncums, Campanella did not believe in miracles, or in heaven and hell. The \nChurch had promoted such superstitions, he wrote, to control the common \nfolk by keeping them in fear. Such ideas verged on atheism, and Cam­\npanella expressed them incautiously. In 1593 the Inquisition threw hirn Bene vixit. qui bene \nlatuit-\"He lives weil \nwho conceals himself \nweil.\" \nOVID, \nc. 43 B.C'.-A.D. 18 \nWise men [should beJ \nlike coffers with douhle \nbottoms: Which when \nothers look into, being \nopened, they see not all \nthat they hold. \nSIR WALTER RALEIGH, \n1554-1618 \n\\\\111<:,\\ TIIE \\\\A TEHS \n\\rEHE ClIA1'.CI ·:1J \nOnce upon a time \nKhidr, the teacher of \nMoses, cal/ed upon \nmankind with a warn­\ning. At a certain date, \nhe said, all the water in \nthe world which had \nnot been specially \nhoarded, would disap­\npear. It would then be \nrcnewed, with different \nwater, which would \ndrive men mad. \nOnly one man listened \nto the meaning of this \nadvice. He colleeted \nwater and went to a \nsecure place where he \nstored it, and waited for \nthe water to change its \ncharacter. \nOn the appointed date \nthe streams stopped \nrunning, the wells wellt \ndry, and the man who \nhad listened, seeing this \nLAW 38 319 \nhappening, went to his \nretreat and drank his \npreserved water. \nWhen he saw, fram his \nsecurity, the waterfalls \nagain beginning to \nfiow, this man \ndescended among the \nother sons of men. He \nfound that they were \nthinking and talking in \nan entirely different \nway from before; yet \nthey had no memory of \nwhat had happened, \nnor of having been \nwarned. When he tried \nto talk to them, he real­\nized that they thought \nthat he was mad, and \nthey showed hostility or \ncompassi on, not under­\nstanding. \nAt first he drank none \nof the new water, but \nwent back to his \nconcealment, to draw \non his supplies, every \nday. Finally, however, \nhe took the decision to \ndrink the new water \nbecause he could not \nbear the loneliness of \nliving, behaving and \nthinking in a different \nway fram everyone \nelse. He drank the new \nwater, and became like \nthe rest. Then he forgot \nall about his own store \nof special water, and \nhis fellows began to \nlook upon him as a \nmadman who had \nmiraculousl y been \nrestored to sanity. \nTALES OF \nTHE DERVISHES, \nIDRIES SHAH, \n1967 \n320 LAW 38 into prison for his heretical beliefs. Six years later, as a form of partial re­\nlease, he was confined to a monastery in Naples. \nSouthem Italy was controlled by Spain at the time, and in Nap les \nCampanella became involved in a plot to fight and throw out these in­\nvaders. His hope was to establish an independent republic based on his \nown ideas of utopia. The leaders of the Italian Inquisition, working with \ntheir Spanish counterparts, had hirn imprisoned aga in. This time they also \ntortur ed hirn, to discover the true nature ofhis impious belief s: He was sub­\njected to the infa mous la veglia, a torture in which he was suspended by his \narms in a squatting position a few inches above a seat studded with spikes. \nThe posture was impossible to sustain, and in time the victim would end up \nsitting on the spikes, which would tear his flesh at the slightest contact. \nDuring these years, however, Campanella leamed something about \npower. Facing the prospect of execution for heresy, he changed his strat­\negy : He would not renounce his beliefs, yet he knew he had to disguise \ntheir outward appeara nce. \nTo save his life, Campanella feigned mad ness. He let his inquisitors \nimagine that his belief s stemmed from an incontrollable unsoundness of \nmind. For a while the tortur es continu ed, to see if his insanity was faked, \nbut in 1603 his sentence was commuted to life in prison. The first four \nyears of this he spent cha ined to a wall in an underground dunge on. De­\nspite such conditions, he continued to write--although no longer would he \nbe so foolish as to express his ideas directly. \nOne book of Campanella's, The Hispanic Monarchy, promoted the idea \nthat Spain had a divine mission to expand its powers around the world, \nand offered the Spanish king practical, Machia velli-type adv ice for achiev­\ning this. Despite his own int erest in Machia velli, the book in general pre­\nsented ideas completely the opposite to his own. The Hispanic Monarchy was \nin fact a ploy, an atte mpt to show his conversion to orthodoxy in the bold­\nest manner possible. It worke d: In 1626, six years after its publication, the \npope finally let Campanella out of prison. \nShortly after gaining his freedom, Campanella wrote Atheism Con­\nquered, a book attacking 'free-thinkers, Machiavellia ns, Calvinists, and \nheretics of all strip es. The book is written in the form of debates in which \nheretics express their belief s and are counte red by arguments for the supe­\nriority of Catholic ism. Campanella had obviously reformed-his book \nmade that dear. Or did it? \nThe arguments in the mouths of the heretics had never before been \nexpressed with such verve and freshness. Pretending to present their side \nonly to knock it down, Campanella actually summarized the case against \nCatho licism with striking passion. When he argu ed the other side, suppos­\nedly his side, on the other hand, he resorted to stale dicbes and convoluted \nrationa les. Brief and eloquent, the heret ics' arguments seemed bold and \nsincere . The lengthy arguments for Catholicism seemed tiresome and un­\nconvincing. \nCat holics who read the book found it disturbing and ambigu ous, but \nthey could not claim it was heretical, or that Campanella should be re­\ntumed to prison. His defense of Catholicism, after all, used arguments they \nhad used themselve s. Yet in the years to come, Atheism Conqueredbecame a \nbible for atheists, Machiavellians and libertines who used the arguments \nCampanella had put in their mouths to defend their dangerous ideas. Com­\nbining an outward display of conformity with an expression of his true be­\nliefs in a way that his sympathizers would understand, Campanella showed \nthat he had learned his lesson. \nInterpretation \nIn the face of awesome persecution, Campanella devised three strate­\ngie moves that saved his hide, freed hirn from prison, and allowed hirn to \ncontinue to express his beliefs. First he feigned madness--the medieval \nequivalent of disavowing responsibility for one's actions, like blaming \none's parents today. Next he wrote a book that expressed the exact oppo­\nsite of his own beliefs. Finally, and most brilliantly of all, he disguised his \nideas while insinuating them at the same time. It is an old but powerful \ntriek: You pretend to disagree with dangerous ideas, but in the course of \nyour disagreement you give those ideas expression and exposure. You \nseem to conform to the prevailing orthodoxy, but those who know will un­\nderstand the irony involved. You are protected. \nIt is inevitable in society that certain values and customs lose contact \nwith their original motives and become oppressive . And there will always \nbe those who rebel against such oppression, harboring ideas far ahead of \ntheir time. As Campanella was forced to realize, however, there is no point \nin making a display of your dangerous ideas if they only bring you suffer­\ning and persecution. Martyrdom serves no purpose--better to live on in an \noppressive world, even to thrive in it. Meanwhile find a way to express \nyour ideas subtly for those who understand you. Laying your pearls before \nswine will only bring you trouble. \nFor a long time I have not said wh at I believed, nOT do lever believe \nwhat I say, and if indeed sometimes I do happen to tell the truth, \nI hide it among so many lies that it is hard to find. \nNiccolo Machiavel li. in a letter to Francesco Guicciardini, May 17, 1521 \nKEYS TO POWER \nWe all tell lies and hide our true feelings, for complete free expression is a \nsodal impossibility.

In the end, though, their arguments con­\nvince only a few and offend a great deal more. The reason arguments do \nnot work is that most people hold their ideas and values without thinking \nabout them. There is a strong emotional content in their belief s: They re­\nally do not want to have to rework their habits of thinking, and when you \nchallenge them, whether directly through your arguments or indirec tly \nthrough your behavior, they are hostile. \nWise and clever people learn early on that they can display con ven­\ntional behavior and mouth conventional ideas without having to believe in \nthem . The power these people gain from blending in is that of being left \nalone to have the thoughts they want to have, and to express them to the \npeople they want to express them to, without suff ering isola tion or os­\ntracism. Once they have established themselves in a position of power, \nthey can try to convince a wider circle of the correctness of their ideas-­\nperhaps working indirectly, using Campa nella' s strateg ies of irony and in­\nsinuati on. \nIn the late fourt eenth century, the Spanish began a massive persecu­\ntion of the Jews, murdering thousands and driving others out of the coun­\ntry. Those who remai ned in Spain were forced to convert. Yet over the next \nthree hundred years, the Spanish noticed a phenomenon that disturbed \nthem: Many of the converts lived their outward lives as Catholics, yet \nsomehow managed to retain their Jewish beliefs, practicing the religion in \npriva te. Many of these so-called Marra nos (originally a derogatory term, \nbeing the Spanish for \"pig\") attained high levels of govemment office, mar­\nried into the nobility, and gave every appearance of Christian piety, only \nto be discovered late in life as practicing Jews. (The Spanish Inquisition \nwas specifically commissioned to ferret them out.) Over the years they \nmastered the art of dissimulat ion, displaying crucifixes liberally, giving \ngenerous gifts to churc hes, even occasionally making anti- Semitic \nremarks-and all the while maintaining their inner freedom and beliefs. \nIn society, the Marranos knew, outward appearanc es are what matter. \nThis remains true today. The strategy is simple: As Campanella did in writ­\ning Atheism Conquered, make a show of bIen ding in, even going so far as to \nbe the most zealous advocate of the prevailing orthodoxy. If you stick to \nconventional appearances in public few will believe you think diff erently \nin private . \nDo not be so foolish as to imagine that in our own time the old ortho­\ndoxies are gone. Jonas Salk, for insta nce, thought science had gotten past \npolitics and protocol. And so, in his search for a polio vaccine, he broke all \nthe rule s-going public with a discovery before showing it to the scientific \ncommunity, taking credit for the vaccine without acknowledging the scien­\ntists who had paved the way, making hirnself a star. The public may have \nloved hirn but scientists shun ned hirn.

Other \nwriters called before the committee made a point of attacking its members, \nand of acting as belligerently as possible in order to gain sympathy for \nthemselves. Brecht, on the other hand, who had actually worked stead-\n. fastly for the Communist cause, played the opposite game: He answered \nquestions with ambiguous generalit ies that defied easy interpretati on. Call \nit the Campanella strategy. Brecht even wore a suit-a rare event for him­\nand made a point of smoking a cigar during the proceedings, knowing that \na key committee member had a passion for cigars. In the end he charmed \nthe committee members, who let hirn go scot-free. \nBrecht then moved to East Germany, where he encountered a differ­\nent kind of Inquisition. Here the Communists were in power, and they crit­\nicized his plays as decadent and pessimistic. He did not argue with them, \nbut made small changes in the performan ce scripts to shut them up. Mean­\nwhile he managed to preserve the published texts as written. His outward \nconformity in both cases gave hirn the freedom to work unhindered, with­\nout having to change his thinking. In the end, he made his way safely \nthrough dangerous times in different countries through the use of little \ndances of orthodoxy, and proved he was more powerful than the forces of \nrepression. \nNot only do people of power avoid the offenses of Pausanias and Salk, \nthey also leam to play the clever fox and feign the common touch. This has \nbeen the ploy of con artists and politicians throughout the centuries. Lead­\ners like Julius Caesar and Franklin D.

When you go into society, leave behind your own \nideas and values, and put on the mask that is most appropriate for the \ngroup in which you find yourse lf. Bismarck played this game successfully \nfor years-there were people who vaguely understood what he was up to, \nbut not clearly enough that it mattered.

His spies and confidants had confirmed a \nrumor that his foreign minister Talleyrand had conspired against hirn with \nFouche, the minister of police. Immedia telyon arriving in the capital the \nshocked emperor summoned his ministers to the palace. Following them \ninto the meeting right after their arrival, he began pacing up and down, \nand started rambling vaguely about plotters working against hirn, specula­\ntors bringing down the stock market, legislators delaying his policies-and \nhis own ministers undermining hirn, \nAs Napoleon talked, Talleyrand leaned on the mantelpiece, looking \ncompletely indifferent. Facing Talleyrand directly, Napoleon announced, \n\"For these ministers, treason has begun when they permit themselves to \ndoubt.\" At the word \"treason\" the ruler expected his minister to be afraid, \nBut Talleyrand only smiled, calm and bored. \nThe sight of a subordinate apparently serene in the face of charges that \ncould get hirn hanged pushed Napoleon to the edge. There were ministers, \nhe said, who wanted hirn dead, and he took a step doser to Talleyrand­\nwho stared back at hirn unfazed. Finally Napoleon exploded. \"You are a \ncoward,\" he screamed in Talleyrand's face, \"a man of no faith. Nothing is \nsacred to you. You would sell your own father. 1 have showered you with \nriches and yet there is nothing you would not do to hurt me.\" The other \nministers looked at each other in disbelief-they had never seen this fear­\nless general, the conqueror of most of Europe, so unhinged. \n\"You deserve to be broken like glass,\" Napoleon continued, stamping, \n\"I have the power to do it, but 1 have too much contempt for you to bother. \nWhy didn't 1 have you hanged from the gates of the Tuileries? But there is \nstill time for that.\" Yelling, almost out of breath, his face red, his eyes \nbulging, he went on, \"You, by the way, are nothing but shit in a silk stock­\ning .. , . What about your wife? You never told me that San Carlos was yOUf \nwife's lover?\" \"Indeed, sire, it did not occur to me that this information had \nany bearing on Your Majesty's glory or my own,\" said Talleyrand calmly, \ncompletely unflustered. Mter a few more insults, Napoleon walked away. \nTalleyrand slowly crossed the room, moving with his characteristic limp. \nAs an attendant helped hirn with his doak, he tumed to his fellow ministers \n(all afraid they would never see hirn again), and said, \"What a pity, gentle­\nmen, that so great a man should have such bad manners.\" \nDespite his anger, Napoleori)iid not arrest his foreign minister. He \nmerely relieved hirn of his duties ,d banished hirn from the court, believ­\ning that for this man humiliation would be punishment enough, He did not \nrealize that word had quickly spread of his tirade-of how the emperor had \ncompletely lost control of hirnself, and how Talleyrand had essentially hu­\nmiliated hirn by maintaining his composure and dignity. A page had been \ntumed: For the first time people had seen the great emperor lose his cool \nunder fire. A feeling spread that he was on the way down. As Talleyrand \nlater said, \"This is the beginning ofthe end.\" \nInterpretation \nThis was indeed the beginning of the end. Waterloo was still six years \nahead, but Napoleon was on a slow descent to defeat, crystallizing in 1812 \nwith his disastrous invasion of Russia. Talleyrand was the first to see the \nsigns of his decline, especially in the irrational war with Spain. Sometime in \n1808, the minister decided that for the future peace of Europe, Napoleon \nhad to go. And so he conspired with Fouche. \nIt is possible that the conspiracy was never anything more than a \nploy-a device to push Napoleon over the edge. For it is hard to believe \nthat two of the most practical men in history would only go halfway in their \nplotting. They may have been only stirring the waters, trying to goad \nNapoleon into a misstep. And indeed, what they got was the tantrum that \nlaid out his loss of control for all to see. In fact, Napoleon's soon-famous \nblowup that afternoon had a profoundly negative effect on his public \nimage. \nThis is the problem with the angry response. At first it may strike fear \nand terror, but only in some, and as the days pass and the storm clears, \nother responses emerge-e mbarrassment and uneasiness about the \nshouter's capacity for going out of control, and resentrnent of what has \nbeen said. Losing your temper, you always make unfair and exaggerated \naccusations. A few such tirades and people are counting the days until you \nare gone. \nIn the face of a conspiracy against hirn, a conspiracy between his two \nmost important ministers, Napoleon certainly had a right to feel angry and \nanxious. Eut by responding so angrily, and so publicly, he only demon­\nstrated his frustration. To show your frustration is to show that you have \nlost your power to shape events; it is the helpless action of the child who re­\nsorts to a hysterical fit to get his way. The powerful never reveal this kind of \nweakness. \nThere were a number of things Napoleon could have done in this situ­\nation. He could have thought about the fact that two eminently sensible \nmen had had reason to turn against hirn, and could have listened and \nlearned from them. He could have tried to win them back to hirn. He could \neven have gotten rid of them, making their imprisonment or death an omi­\nnous display of his power. No tirades, no childish fits, no embarrassing \nafter-effects- just a quiet and definitive severing of ties. \nRemember: Tantrums neither intimidate nor inspire loyalty. They \nonly create doubts and uneasiness about your power. Exposing your weak­\nness, these stormy eruptions often herald a fall. \nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW \nBy the late 1920s, Haile Selassie had nearly achieved his goal of assuming \ntotal control over Ethiopia, a country he feIt needed strong and unified \nleadership.

Selassie knew the \nroyal couple hated hirn and wanted to get rid of hirn, so to cut short their \nplotting he made Gugsa the governor of the northern province of \nBegemeder, forcing hirn to leave the capital, where the empress lived. \nFor several years Gugsa played the loyal administrator_ But Selassie \ndid not trust hirn: He knew that Gugsa and the empress were plotting re­\nvenge_ As time passed and Gugsa made no move, the chances of a plot \nonly increased. Selassie knew what he had to do: draw Gugsa out, get \nunder his skin, and push hirn into action before he was ready. \nFor several years, a northern tribe, the Azebu Gallas, had been in vir­\ntual rebellion against the throne, robbing and pillaging local villages and \nrefusing to pay taxes. Selassie had done nothing to stop them, letting them \ngrow stronger. Finally, in 1929, he ordered Ras Gugsa to lead an army \nagainst these disobedient tribesmen. Gugsa agreed, but inwardly he \nseethed-he had no grudge aga inst the Azebu Gallas, and the demand that \nhe fight them hurt his pride. He could not disobey the order, but as he \nworked to put together an army, he began to spread an ugly rumor-that \nSelas sie was in cahoots with the pope, and planned to convert the country \nto Roman Catholicism and make it a colony of Italy_ Gugsa's army swelled, \nand some of the tribes from which its soldiers came secretly agreed to fight \nSelas sie. In March of 1930 an enormous force of 35,000 men began to \nmarch, not on the Azebu Gallas but south, toward the capital of Addis \nAbaba. Made confident by his growing strength, Gugsa now openly led a \nholy war to depose Selas sie and put the country back in the hands of true \nChristian s. \nHe did not see the trap that had been laid for hirn. Before Selassie had \nordered Gugsa to fight the Azebu Gallas, he had secured the support of the \nEthiopian church. And before the revolt got underway, he had bribed sev­\neral of Gugsa's key allies not to show up for battle. As the rebel army \nmarched south, airplanes flew overhead dropping leaflets announcing that \nthe highest church officials had recognized Selassie as the true Christian \nleader of Ethiopia, and that they had excommunicated Gugsa for foment­\ning a civil war. These leaflets severely blunted the emotions behind the \nholy crusade. And as battle loomed and the support that Gugsa's allies had \npromised hirn failed to show up, soldiers began to flee or defect. \nWhen the battle came, the rebel army quicky collapsed. Refusing to \nsurrender, Ras Gugsa was killed in the fighting. The empress, distraught \nover her husband's death, died a few days later. On April 30, Selassie is­\nsued a formal proclarnation announcing his new title: Emperor of Ethiopia. \nInterpretation \nHaile Selassie always saw several moves ahead. He knew that if he let Ras \nGugsa decide the time and place of the revolt, the danger would be much \ngreater than ifhe forced Gugsa to act on Selassie's terms. So he goaded hirn \ninto rebellion by offending his manly pride, asking hirn to fight people he \nhad no quarrel with on behalf of a man he hated. Thinking everything out \nahead, Selassie made sure that Gugsa's rebellion would come to nothing, \nand that he could use it to do away with his last two enemies. \nThis is the essence of the Law: When the waters are still, your oppo­\nnents have the time and space to plot actions that they will initiate and con­\ntrol. So stir the waters, force the fish to the surface, get them to act before \ntheyare ready, steal the initiative. The best way to do this is to play on un­\ncontrollable emotions-pride, vanity, love, hate. Once the water is stirred \nup, the little fish cannot help but rise to the bait. The angrier they become, \nthe less control they have, and finally they are caught in the whirlpool you \nhave made, and they drown. \nA sovereign should never launch an army out 01 anger, \naleader should never start a war out olwrath. \nSun-tzu, fourth century B. c. \nKEYS TO POWER \nAngry people usually end up looking ridiculous, for their response seems \nout of proportion to what occasioned it. They have taken things too seri­\nously, exaggerating the hurt or insult that has been done to them. They are \nso sensitive to slight that it becomes comical how much they take person­\nally. More comical still is their belief that their outbursts signify power. The \ntruth is the opposite: Petulance is not power, it is a sign of helplessness. \nPeople may temporarily be cowed by your tantrums, hut in the end they \nlose respect for you. They also realize they can easily undermine a person \nwith so little self-control. \nThe answer, however, is not to repress our angry or emotional re­\nsponses. For repression drains us of energy and pushes us into strange be­\nhavior. Instead we have to change our perspective: We have to realize that \nnothing in the sodal realm, and in the game of power, is personal. \nEveryone is caught up in achain of events that long predates the pre­\nsent moment. Our anger often sterns from problems in our childhood, \nfrom the problems of our parents which stern from their own childhood, on \nand on. Our anger also has roots in the many interactions with others, the \naccumulated disappointments and heartaches that we have suffered. An in­\ndividual will often appear as the instigator of our anger but it is much more \ncomplicat ed, goes far beyond what that individual did to uso If a person ex­\nplodes with anger at you (and it seems out of proportion to what you did to \nthem), you must remind yourself that it is not exclusively directed at you­\ndo not be so vain. The cause is much larger, goes way back in time, in­\nvolves dozens of prior hurts, and is actually not worth the bother to \nunderstand. Instead of seeing it as a personal grudge , look at the emotional \noutburst as a disguised power move, an attempt to control or punish you \ncloaked in the form of hurt feelings and anger. \nThis shift of perspective will let you play the game of power with more \nclarity and energy. Instead of overreacting, and becoming ensnared in peo-OITC!{ HI(;II PRIEST \nKin'yo, an officer of the \nsecond rank, had a \nbrother called the High \nPriest Ryogaku, an \nextremely bad­\ntempered man.

Instead he ordered the docu­\nments bumed and the matter forgotten. At this critical moment in the bat­\nde, to get upset or demand justice would have reverberated against hirn: \nAn angry action would have called attention to the generals' disloyalty, \nwhich would have harmed the troops' morale. Justice could wait-he \nwould deal with the generals in time. Ts'ao Ts'ao kept his head and made \nthe right decision. \nCompare this to Napoleon's response to Talleyrand: Instead of taking \nthe conspiracy personally, the emperor should have played the game like \nTs'ao Ts'ao, carefully weighing the consequences of any action he took. \nThe more powerful response in the end would have been to ignore Tal­\nleyrand, or to bring the minister gradually back to his side and punish him \nlater. \nAnger only cuts off our options, and the powerful cannot thrive with­\nout options. Once you train yourself not to take matters personally, and to \ncontrol your emotional responses, you will have placed yourself in a posi­\ntion of tremendous power: Now you can play with the emotional responses \nof other people. Stir the insecure into action by impugning their manhood, \nand by dangling the prospect of an easy victory before their faces. Do as \nHoudini did when challenged by the less successful escape artist Kleppini: \nReveal an apparent weakness (Houdini let Kleppini steal the combination \nfor a pair of cuffs) to lure your opponent into action. Then you can beat \nhirn with ease. With the arrogant too you can appear weaker than you are, \ntaunting them into a rash action. \nSun Pin, commander of the armies of Ch'i and loyal disciple of Sun­\ntzu, once led his troops against the armies of Wei, which outnumbered hirn \ntwo to one. \"Let us light a hundred thousand fires when our army enters \nWei,\" suggested Sun Pin, \"fifty thousand on the next day, and only thirty \nthousand on the third.\" On the third day the Wei general exclaimed, \"I \nknew the men of Ch'i were cowards, and after only three days more than \nhalf of them have deserted!\" So, leaving behind his slow-moving heavy in­\nfantry, the general decided to seize the moment and move swiftly on the \nCh'i camp with a lighdy armed force. Sun Pin's troops retreated, luring \nWei's army into a narrow pass, where they ambushed and destroyed them. \nWith the Wei general dead and his forces decimated, Sun Pin now easily \ndefeated the rest of his army. \nIn the face of a hot-headed enemy, finally, an excellent response is no \nresponse. Follow the Talleyrand tactic: Nothing is as infuriating as a man \nwho keeps his cool while others are losing theirs. If it will work to your ad­\nvantage to unsettle people, affect the aristocratic, bored pose, neither \nmocking nor triumphant but simply indifferent. This will light their fuse. \nWhen they embarrass themselves with atemper tantrum, you will have \ngained several victories, one of these being that in the face of their childish­\nness you have maintain ed your dignity and composure. \nImage: The Pond of Fish. The waters \nare clear and calm, and the fish are weIl below the surface. \nStir the waters and they emerge. Stir it so me more and they get \nangry, rising to the surface, biting whatever comes near­\nincluding a freshly baited hook. \nAuthority: If your opponent is of a hot temper, try to irritate hirn. If he \nis arrogant, try to encourage his egotism. . . . One who is skilled at \nmaking the enemy move does so by creating a situation according to \nwhich the enemy will act; he entices the enemy with something he is \ncertain to take. He keeps the enemy on the move by holding out bait \nand then attacks hirn with picked troops. (Sun-tzu, fourth century B.C.) \nREVERSAL \nWhen playing with people's emotions you have to be careful. Study the \nenemy beforehan d: Some fish are best left at the bottom of the pond. \nThe leaders of the city of Tyre, capital of ancient Phoenicia, feIt confi­\ndent they could withstand Alexander the Great, who had conquered the \nOrient but had not attacked their city, which stood weIl protected on the \nwater. They sent ambassadors to Alexander saying that although they \nwould recognize hirn as emperor they would not allow hirn or his forces to \nenter Tyre. This of course enraged hirn, and he immediately mounted a \nsiege. For four months the city withstood hirn, and finally he decided that \nthe struggle was not worth it, and that he would come to tenns with the \nTyrians. But they, feeling that they had already baited Alexander and got­\nten away with it, and confident that they could withstand hirn, refused to \nLAW 39 331 \n332 LAW 39 negotiate-- in fact they killed his messengers. \nThis pushed Alexan der over the edge. Now it did not matter to him \nhow long the siege lasted or how large an army it needed; he had the re­\nsources, and would do whatever it took. He remounted his assault so stren­\nuously that he captured Tyre within days, burned it to the ground, and sold \nits people into slavery. \nYou can bait the powerful and get them to commit and divide their \nforces as Sun Pin did, but test the waters first. Find the gap in their strength. \nIf there is no gap-if they are impossibly strong-you have nothing to gain \nand everything to lose by provoking them. Choose carefully whom you \nbait, and never stir up the sharks. \nFinally there are times when a well-timed burst of anger can do you \ngood, but your anger must be manufac tured and under your control. Then \nyou can determine exactly how and on whom it will fall. Never stir up re­\nactions that will work against you in the long fUll. And use your thunder­\nbolts rarely, to make them the more intimida ting and meaningful.

By paying the full price, they keep them­\nselves free of dangerous entangle ments and worries. \nBeing open and flexible with money also teaches the value of strategie \ngenerosity, a variation on the old trick of \"giving when you are about to \ntake.\" By giving the appropriate gift, you put the recipient under obliga­\ntion. Generosity softens people up--to be deceived. By gaining a reputa­\ntion for liberality, you win people's admiration while distracting them from \nyour power plays. By strategically spreading your wealth, you charm the \nother courtiers, creating pleasure and making valuable allies. \nLook at the masters of power-the Caesars, the Queen Elizabeths, the \nMichelang elos, the Medicis: Not a miser among them. Even the great con \nartists spend freely to swindle . Tight purse strings are unattractiv e--when \nengaged in seduction, Casanova would give completely not only of himself \nbut of his wallet. The powerful understand that money is psycho logically \ncharged, and that it is also avessei of politeness and sociability. They make \nthe human side of money a weapon in their armory. \nFor everyone able to play with money, thousands more are locked in a \nself-destructive refusal to use money creatively and strategically. These \ntypes represent the opposite pole to the powerful, and you must leam to \nrecognize them-either to avoid their poisonous natures or to turn their in­\nflexibility to your advantage : \nThe Greedy Fish. The greedy fish take the human side out of money. \nCold and ruthless, they see only the lifeless balance sheet; viewing others \nsolely as either pawns or obstructions in their pursuit of wealth, they tram­\nple on people's sentiments and alienate valuable allies. No one wants to \nwork with the greedy fish, and over the years they end up isolated, which \noften proves their undoing. \nGreedy fish are the con artist's bread and butter: Lured by the bait of \neasy money, they swallow the ruse hook, line, and sinker. They are easy to \ndeceive, for they spend so much time dealing with numbers (not with peo­\npIe) that they become blind to psychology, including their own. Either \navoid them before they exploit you or play on their greed to your gain. \nThe Bargain Demon. Powerful people judge everything by what it costs, \nnot just in money but in time, dignity, and peace of mind. And this is ex­\nactly what Bargain Demons cannot do. Wasting valuable time digging for \nbargains, they worry endlessly about what they could have gotten else­\nwhere for a little less. On top of that, the bargain item they do buy is often \nshabby; perhaps it needs costly repairs, or will have to be replaced twice as \nfast as a high-quality item. The costs of these pursuits-not always in \nmoney (though the price of a bargain is often deceptive) but in time and \npeace of mind-discourage normal people from undertaking them, but for \nthe Bargain Demon the bargain is an end in itself. \nThese types might seem to harm only themselves, but their attitudes \nare contagious: Unless you resist them they will infect you with the inse­\neure feeling that you should have looked harder to find a cheaper price. \nDon't argue with them or try to change them. Just mentally add up the \neost, in time and inner peace if not in hidden financial expense, of the irra­\ntional pursuit of a bargain. \nThe Sadist. Financial sadists play vicious power games with money as a \nway of asserting their power. They might, for examp le, make you wait for \nmoney that is owed you, promising you that the check is in the mail. Or if \nthey hire you to work for them, they meddle in every aspect of the job, \nhaggling and giving you ulcers. Sadists seem to think that paying for some­\nthing gives them the right to torture and abuse the seIler. They have no \nsense of the courtier element in money. If you are unlucky enough to get \ninvolved with this type, accepting a financial loss may be better in the long \nrun than getting entangled in their destructive power games. \nThe Indiscriminate Giver. Generosity has adefinite function in power: \nIt attracts people, softens them up, makes allies out of them. But it has to be \nused strategi cally, with a definite end in mind. Indiscriminate Givers, on \nthe other hand, are generous because they want to be loved and admired \nby all. And their generosity is so indiscriminate and needy that it may not \nhave the desired effect: If they give to one and all, why should the recipient \nfeel special? Attractive as it may seem to make an Indis criminate Giver \nyour mark, in any involvement with this type you will often feel burdened \nby their insatiable emotional needs. \nTRAN SGRESSIONS OF THE LAW \nTransgression I \nMter Francisco Pizarro conquered Peru, in 1532, gold from the Incan Em­\npire began to pour into Spain, and Spaniards of all classes started dreaming \nof the instant ric hes to be had in the New World. The story so on spread of \nan Indian chief to the east of Peru who once each year would ritually cover \nhimself in gold dust and dive into a lake. Soon word of mouth transformed \nEI Dorado, the \"Golden Man,\" into an empire called EI Dorado, wealthier \nthan the Incan, where the streets were paved and the buildings inlaid with \ngold. This elaboration of the story did not seem implausible, for surely a \nchief who could afford to waste gold dust in a lake must rule a golden em­\npire. Soon Spaniards were searching for EI Dorado all over northem South \nAmerica. from their inability to \nmake a living and their \nlaziness in this respect. \nThey should not \noccupy themselves with \nabsurdities and untrue \nstories. \nTHE MUOADDIMAH, \nIBN KHALDÜN, \n1332-1 406 \nTllE MISER \nAmiser, to make sure \nof his property, sold all \nthat he had and \nconverted it into a great \nlump of gold, which he \nhid in a hole in the \nground, and went \ncontinual ly to visit and \ninspect it. This roused \nthe curiosity of one of \nhis workmen, who, \nsuspecting that there \nwas a treasure. when \nhis master's back was \nturned, went to the \nspot, and stole it away. \nWhen the miser \nreturned and found the \nplace empty, he wept \nand tore his hair. But a \nneighbor who saw him \nin this extravagant \ngriej, and learned the \ncause of it, said: \"Fret \nthyselfno longer, but \ntake a stone and put it \nin the same place, and \nthin k that it is your \nlump of gold; for, as \nyou never meant to use \nit, the one will do you \nas much good as the \nother.\" \nThe worth of money is \nnot in its possession, \nbut in its use. \nFABLES, \nAESOP, \nSIXTH CENTURY B.e. \nLAW 40 335 \nThere is a popular \nsaying in Japan that \ngoes \"Tada yori takai \nmono wa nai,\" mean­\ning: \"Nothing is more \ncostly than something \ngiven free of charge. \" \nTHE UNSPOKEN WAY, \nMICHIH IRO \nMATSUM OTO, \n1988 \nMONEY \nYusuf Ibn Jafar el-\nAmudi used to take \nsums of money, some­\ntimes very large ones, \nfrom those who came \nto study wirh him. \nA distinguished legalist \nvisiting him on ce said: \n\"1 am enchanted and \nimpressed by your \nteaching s, and I am \nsure that you are \ndirecting your disciples \nin a proper manner. \nBut it is not in accor­\ndance with tradition to \ntake money for knowl­\nedge.

But a man \nwho takes nothing at \nall is under the gravest \n336 LAW 40 In February of 1541, the largest expedition yet in this venture, led by \nPizarro's brother Gonzalo, left Quito, in Ecuador. Resplendent in their ar­\nmors and colorful silks, 340 Spaniards headed east, along with 4,000 Indi­\nans to carry supplies and serve as scouts, 4,000 swine, dozens of llamas, \nand elose to 1,000 dogs. Eut the expedition was so on hit by torrential rain, \nwhich rotted its gear and spoiled its food. Meanwhile, as Gonzalo Pizarro \nquestioned the Indians they met along the way, those who seemed to be \nwithholding inf ormation, or who had not even heard of the fabulous king­\ndom, he would torture and feed to the dogs. Word of the Spaniards' mur­\nderousness spread quickly among the Indians, who realized that the only \nway to avoid Gonzalo's wrath was to make up stories about EI Dorado \nand send hirn as far away as possible. As Gonzalo and his men followed \nthe leads the Indians gave them, then, they were only led farther into deep \njungle. \nThe explorers' spirits sagged. Their uniforms had long since shredded; \ntheir armor rusted and they threw it away; their shoes were tom to pieces, \nforcing them to walk barefoot; the Indian slaves they had set out with had \neither died or deserted them; they had eaten not only the swine but the \nhunting dogs and llamas. They lived on roots and fruit. Realizing that they \ncould not continue this way, Pizarro decided to risk river travel, and a \nbarge was built out of rotting wood. Eut the journey down the treacherous \nNapo River proved no easier. Setting up camp on the river's edge, Gonzalo \nsent scouts ahead on the barge to find Indian settlements with food. He \nwaited and waited for the scouts to return, only to find out they had de­\ncided to desert the expedition and continue down the river on their own. \nThe rain continued without end. Gonzalo's men forgot about EI Do­\nrado; they wanted only to return to Quito. Finally, in August of 1542, a lit­\ntle over a hundred men, from an expedition originally numbering in the \nthousands, managed to find their way back. To the residents of Quito they \nseemed to have emerged from hell itself, wrapped in tatters and skins, their \nbodies covered in sores, and so emaciated as to be unrecognizab le. For \nover a year and a half they had marched in an enormous cirele, two thou­\nsand miles by foot. The vast sums of money invested in the expedition had \nyielded nothing-no sign of EI Dorado and no sign of gold. \nInterpretation \nEven after Gonzalo Pizarro's disaster, the Spaniards launched expedition \nafter expedition in search of EI Dorado. And like Pizarro the conquistadors \nwould bum and loot villages, torture Indians, endure unimaginable hard­\nships, and get no eloser to gold. The money they spent on such expeditions \ncannot be calculated; yet despite the futility of the search, the lure of the \nfantasyendured. \nNot only did the search for EI Dorado cost millions of lives-both In­\ndian and Spanish-it helped bring the ruin of the Spanish empire. Gold be­\ncame Spain's obsession. The gold that did find its way back to Spain-and \na lot did-was reinvested in more expeditions, or in the purehase of luxu­\nries, rather than in agriculture or any other productive endeavor. Whole \nSpanish towns were depopulated as their menfolk left to hunt gold. Farms \nfell into ruin, and the army had no recruits for its European wars. By the \nend of the seventeenth century, the entire country had shrunk by more \nthan half of its population; the city of Madrid had gone from a population \nof 400,000 to 150,000. With diminishing returns from its efforts over so \nmany years, Spain fell into a decline from which it never recovered. \nPower requires self-discipli ne. The prospect of wealth, particularly \neasy, sudden wealth, plays havoc with the emotions. The suddenly rich be­\nlieve that more is always possible.

Understa nd: With one \nexception-death-no lasting change in fortune comes quickly. Sudden \nwealth rarely lasts, for it is built on nothing solid.

Leave EI Dorado for \nsuckers and fools. \nTransgression 11 \nIn the early eighteenth century, no one stood higher in English society \nthan the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough . The duke, having led suc­\ncessful campaigns against the French, was considered Europe's premier \ngeneral and strategist. And his wife, the duchess, after much maneuvering, \nhad established herself as the favorite of Queen Anne, who became ruler \nof England in 1702. In 1704 the duke's triumph at the Battle of Blenheim \nmade hirn the toast of England, and to honor hirn the queen awarded hirn \na large plot of land in the town of Woodstock, and the funds to create a \ngreat palace there. Calling his planned horne the Palace of Blenheim, the \nduke chose as his architect the young John Vanbrugh, a kind of Renais­\nsance man who wrote plays as weIl as designed buildings . And so con­\nstruction began, in the summer of 1705, with much fanfare and great \nhopes. \nVanbrugh had a dramatist's sense of architecture. His palace was to be \na monument to Marlborough's brilliance and power, and was to include \nartificial lakes, enormous bridges, elaborate gardens, and other fantastical \ntouches. From day one, however, the duchess could not be pleased: She \nthought Vanbrugh was wasting money on yet another stand of trees; she \nwanted the palace finished as so on as possible. The duchess tortured Van­\nbrugh and his workmen on every detail. She was consumed with petty \nmaUers; although the government was paying for Blenheim, she counted \nevery penny. Eventually her grumbling, about Blenheim and other things \ntoo, created an irreparable rift between her and Queen Anne, who, in 1711, \ndismissed her from the court, ordering her to vacate her apartments at the \nroyal palace. When the duchess left (fuming over the loss of her position, \nand also of her royal salary), she emptied the apartment of every fixture \ndown to the brass doorknobs. \nOver the next ten years, work on Blenheim would stop and start, as \nthe funds became harder to procure from the government. The duchess suspicion of robbing \nthe disciple of his soul. \nPeople who say, 'I take \nnothing, ' may be found \nto take away the vo/i­\ntion of their victim.\" \nTHE DERMIS PROBE, \nIDRIES SHAH, \n1970 \nTIIE �IA[\\ \\nw \nLOVED \\!O 'iEY IlETTEH \nTHA\" L1n: \nIn ancient times there \nwas an old woodcutter \nwho went to the moun­\ntain almost every day \nto cut wood. \nIt was said that this old \nman was a miser who \nhoarded his silver until \nit changed to gold, and \nthat he ca red more for \ngold than anything else \nin all the world. \nOne day a wilderness \ntiger sprang at him and \nthough he ran he could \nnot escape, and the \ntiger carried him off in \nits mouth. \nThe woodcutter' s son \nsaw his father's danger, \nand ran to save him il \npossible.

She quibbled over every carload of \nstone and bushel of lime, counted every extra yard of iron railing or foot of \nwainscot, hurling abuse at the wasteful workmen, contractors, and survey­\nors. Marlborough, old and weary, wanted nothing more than to settle into \nthe palace in his last years, but the project became bogged down in a \nswamp of litigation, the workmen suing the duchess for wages, the duchess \nsuing the architect right back. In the midst of this interminable wrangling, \nthe duke died. He had never spent a night in his beloved Blenheim. \nAfter Marlboroug h's death, it becarne clear that he had a vast estate, \nworth over .E2 million-more than enough to pay for finishing the palace. \nBut the duchess would not relent: She held back Vanbrugh's wages as weIl \nas the workmen 's, and finally had the architect dismissed. The man who \ntook his place finished Blenheim in a few years, following Vanbrugh's de­\nsigns to the letter. Vanbrugh died in 1726, locked out of the palace by the \nduchess, unable to set foot in his greatest creation. Foreshadowing the ro­\nmantic movement, Blenheim had started a whole new trend in architec­\nture, but had given its creator a twenty-year nightmare. \nInterpretation \nFor the Duchess of Marlborough, money was a way to play sadistic power \ngames. She saw the loss of money as a symbolic loss of power. With Van­\nbrugh her contortions went deeper still: He was a great artist, and she en­\nvied his power to create, to attain a farne outside her reach. She may not \nhave had his gifts, but she did have the money to torture and abuse hirn \nover the pettiest details-to ruin his life. \nThis kind of sadism, however, be ars an awful price. It made construc­\ntion that should have lasted ten years take twenty. It poisoned many a rela­\ntionship, alienated the duchess from the court, deeply pained the duke \n(who wanted only to live peacefully in Blenheim) , created endless lawsuits, \nand took years offVanbrugh's life. Finally, too, posterity had the last word: \nVanbrugh is recognized as a genius while the duchess is forever remem­\nbered for her consummate cheapne ss. \nThe powerful must have grandeur of spirit-they can never reveal any \npettiness. And money is the most visible arena in which to display either \ngrandeur or pettiness. Best spend freely, then, and create areputation for \ngenerosity, which in the end will pay great dividends. Never let financial \ndetails blind you to the bigger picture of how people perceive you. Their \nresentment will cost you in the long run. And if you want to meddle in the \nwork of creative people under your hire, at least pay them weIl. Your \nmoney will buy their submission better than your displays of power. \nOBSER VANCES OF THE LAW \nObservance I \nPietro Aretino, son of a lowly shoemaker, had catapulted hirnself into farne \nas a writer of biting satires. But like every Renaissance artist, he needed to \nfind a patron who would give hirn a comf ortable lifestyle while not inter-\nfering with his work. In 1528 Aretino decided to attempt a new strategy in \nthe patronage game. Leaving Rome, he established hirnself in Venice, \nwhere few had heard of hirn. He had a fair amount of money he had man­\naged to save, but little else. Soon after he moved into his new horne, how­\never, he threw open its doors to rich and poor, regaling them with \nbanquets and amusements. He befriended each and every gondolier, tip­\nping them royally. In the streets, he spread his money liberally, giving it \naway to beggars, orphans, washerwom en. Among the city's commoners, \nword quickly spread that Aretino was more than just a great writer, he was \na man of power-a kind of lord. \nArtists and men of influence so on began to frequent Aretino's house. \nWithin a few years he made hirnself a celebrity; no visiting dignitary would \nthink of leaving Venice without paying hirn a call. His generosity had cost \nhirn most of his savings, but had bought hirn influence and a good name­\na cornerstone in the foundation of power. Since in Renaissance Italy as \nelsewhere the ability to spend freely was the privilege of the rich, the aris­\ntocracy thought Aretino had to be a man of influ ence, since he spent \nmoney like one. And since the influence of a man of influence is worth \nbuying, Aretino became the recipient of all sorts of gifts and moneys. \nDukes and duchesses, wealthy merchants, and popes and princes com­\npeted to gain his favor, and showered hirn with all kinds of presents. \nAretino's spending habits, of course, were strategie, and the strategy \nworked like acharm. But for real money and comfort he needed a great \npatron's bottomless pockets. Having surveyed the possibilities, he eventu­\nally set his sights on the extremely wealthy Marquis of Mantua, and wrote \nan epic poem that he dedicated to the marquis. This was a common prac­\ntice of writers looking for patronage: In exchange for a dedication they \nwould get a small stipend, enough to write yet another poem, so that they \nspent their lives in a kind of constant servility. Aretino, however, wanted \npower, not a measly wage. He might dedicate a poem to the marquis, but \nhe would offer it to hirn as a gift, implying by doing so that he was not a \nhired hack looking for a stipend but that he and the marquis were equals. \nAretino's gift-giving did not stop there: As a elose friend of two of \nVenice's greatest artists, the sculptor Jacopo Sansovino and the painter \nTitian, he convinced these men to participate in his gift-giving scheme. \nAretino had studied the marquis before going to work on hirn, and knew \nhis taste inside and out; he was able to advise Sansovino and Titian what \nsubject matter would please the marquis most. When he then sent a Sanso­\nvino sculpture and a Titian painting to the marquis as gifts from all three of \nthem, the man was beside hirnself with joy. \nOver the next few months, Aretino sent other gifts-swords, saddles, \nthe glass that was a Venetian specialty, things he knew the marquis prized. \nSoon he, Titian, and Sansovino began to receive gifts from the marquis in \nreturn. And the strategy went further: When the son-in-Iaw of a friend of \nAretino's found hirnself in jail in Mantua, Aretino was able to get the mar­\nquis to arrange his release. Aretino's friend, a wealthy merchant, was a \nman of great influence in Venice; by turning the goodwill he had built up years passed hy after \nthis promise, and \nPharaoh, doomed to \nruin, continued to live \nin all his magnificence. \nMoses was impatient \nfor God to destroy \nPharaoh quickly, and \nhe could not endure to \nwait any langer. So he \nfasted for forty days \nand went to Mount \nSinai, and in his \ncommuning with god \nhe said, \"0 Lord, Thou \ndidst promise that \nThou wouldst destroy \nPharaoh, and still he \nhas forsaken none of \nhis blasphemies and \npretensions. So when \nwilt Thou destroy \nhirn?\" \nA voice came from The \nTruth saying, \"0 \nMoses, you want Me to \ndestroy Pharaoh as \nquickly as possihle, but \na thousand times a \nthousand of My \nservants want Me never \nto do so, because they \npartake of his bounty \nand enjoy tranquillity \nunder his rule. Sy My \npower I swear that as \nlang as he provides \nabundant food and \ncomfort for My erea-\ntu res, I shall not \ndestroy hirn.\" \nMoses said, \"Then \nwhen will Thy promise \nbe fulfilled?\" God said, \n\"My promise will be \nfulfilled when he with­\nholds his provision \nfrom My creatures. If \never he begins to lessen \nhis bounty, know that \nhis hour is drawing \nnear. \nIt chanced that one day \nPharaoh said to \nHaman, \"Moses has \ngathered the Sons of \nIsrael about hirn and is \ncausing us disquiet. We \nknow not what will he \nLAW 40 339 \nthe issue of his affair \nwith uso We must keep \nour stores fulliest at \nany time we be without \nresources. So we must \nhalve our daily rations \nand keep the saving in \nreserve.\" He deducted \n2,000 sheep, 200 co ws, \nand a 100 camels, and \nsimilarly every two or \nthree days reduced the \nration. Moses then \nknew that the promise \nofThe Truth was near \nto fulfillment, for exces­\nsive economy is a sign \nof decline and a bad \nomen. The masters of \ntradition say that on \nthe day when Pharaoh \nwas drowned only two \newes had been killed in \nhis küchen. \nNothing is better than \ngenerosity .... 1f a man \nis rich and desires, \nwithout a royal charter, \nto act like a lord; if he \nwants men to humble \nthemselves before him, \nto revere him and call \nhim lord and prin ce, \nthen tell him every day \nto spread a table with \nvictuals. All those who \nhave acquired renown \nin the world, have \ngained it mainly \nthrough hospital ity, \nwhile the miserly and \navaricious are despised \nin both worlds. \nTHE BOOK OF \nGOVERNMENT OR \nRULES FOR KINGS, \nNIZAM AL-MuLK, \nELEVENTH CENTURY \n340 LAW 40 with the marquis to use, Aretino had now bought this man's indebted ness, \ntoo, and he in turn would help Aretino when he could. The circle of influ­\nence was growing wider. Time and again, Aretino was able to cash in on \nthe immense political power of the marqui s, who also helped him in his \nmany court romances. \nEventually, however, the relationship became strained, as Aretino \ncame to feel that the marquis should have requited his generosity better. \nBut he would not lower hirnself to begging or whining: Since the exchange \nof gifts between the two men had made them equals, it would not seem \nright to bring up money. He simply withdrew from the marqui s's circle and \nhunted for other wealthy prey, settling first on the French king Francis, \nthen the Medicis, the Duke of Urbino, Emperor Charles V, and more. In \nthe end, having many patrons meant he did not have to bow to any of \nthem, and his power seemed comparable to that of a great lord. \nInterpr etation \nAretino understood two fundamental properties of money: First, that it has \nto circulate to bring power. What money should buy is not lifeless objects \nbut power over people. By keeping money in constant circula tion, Aretino \nbought an ever-expanding circle of influence that in the end more than \ncompensated hirn for his expenses. \nSecond, Aretino understood the key property of the gift. To give a gift \nis to imply that you and the recipient are equals at the very least, or that \nyou are the recipient's superior. A gift also involves an indebted ness or \nobligat ion; when friends, for instance, offer you something for free, you \ncan be sure they expect something in return, and that to get it they are \nmaking you feel indebted. (The mechanism may or may not be entirely \nconscious on their part, but this is how it works.) \nAretino avoided such encumbrances on his freedom. Instead of acting \nlike a menial who expects the powerful to pay his way in life, he turned the \nwhole dynamic around; instead of being indebted to the powerful, he \nmade the powerful indebted to hirn. This was the point of his gift-giving, a \nladder that carried hirn to the hig hest sociallevels. By the end of his life he \nhad become the most famous writer in Europe. \nUndersta nd: Money may determine power relationship s, but those re­\nlationships need not depend on the amount of money you have; they also \ndepend on the way you use it. Powerful people give freely, buying influ­\nence rather than things. If you accept the inferior position because you \nhave no fortune yet, you may find yourself in it forever. Play the trick that \nAretino played on Italy's aristocracy: Imagine yourself an equal. Play the \nlord, give freely, open your doors, circulate your money, and create the fa­\ncade ofpower through an alchemy that transforms money into influence. \nObservance II \nSoon after Baron James Rothschild made his fortune in Paris in the early \n1820s, he faced his most intractable problem: How could aJew and a Ger­\nman, a total outsider to French society, win the respect of the xenophobie \nFrench upper classes? Rothschild was a man who understood power-he \nknew that his fortune would bring hirn status, but that if he remained so­\ncially alienated neither his status nor his fortune would last. So he looked at \nthe society of the time and asked what would win their hearts. \nCharity? The French couldn't care less. Political influence? He already \nhad that, and if anything it only made people more suspicious of hirn. The \none weak spot, he decided, was boredom. In the period of the restoration \nof the monarchy, the French upper classes were bored. So Rothschild \nbegan to spend astounding sums of money on entertaining them. He hired \nthe best architects in France to design his gardens and ballroom; he hired \nMarie-Antoine Careme, the most celebrated French chef, to prepare the \nmost lavish parties Paris had ever witnessed; no Frenchman could resist, \neven if the parties were given by a German Jew. Rothschild's weekly \nsoirees began to attract bigger and bigger numbers. Over the next few \nyears he won the only thing that would seeure an outsider's power: social \nacceptance. \nInterpretation \nStrategie generosity is always a great weapon in building a support base, \nparticularly for the outsider. But the Baron de Rothschild was cleverer still: \nHe knew it was his money that had created the barrier between hirn and \nthe French, making hirn look ugly and untrustworthy. The best way to \novercome this was literally to waste huge sums, a gesture to show he valued \nFrench culture and society over money. What Rothschild did resembled \nthe famous potlatch feasts of the American Northwest: By periodically de­\nstroying its wealth in a giant orgy of festivals and bonfires, an Indian tribe \nwould symbolize its power over other tribes. The base of its power was not \nmoney but its ability to spend, and its confidence in a superiority that \nwould restore to it all that the potlatch had destroyed. \nIn the end, the baron's soirees reflected his desire to mingle not just in \nFrance's business world but in its society. By wasting money on his pot­\nIatches, he hoped to demonstrate that his power went beyond money into \nthe more precious realm of culture. Rothschild may have won social accep­\ntance by spending money, but the support base he gained was one that \nmoney alone could not buy. To secure his fortune he had to \"waste\" it. That \nis strategie generosity in a nutshell-the ability to be flexible with your \nwealth, putting it to work, not to buy objects, but to win people's hearts. \nObservance III \nThe Medicis of Renaissance Florence had built their immense power on \nthe fortune they had made in banking. But in Florence, centuries-old re­\npublic that it was, the idea that money bought power went against all the \ncity's proud democratic values. Cosimo de' Medici, the first of the family to \ngain great fame, worked around this by keeping a low profi le. He never \nflaunted his wealth. But by the time his grandson Lorenzo came of age, in \nthe 1470s, the family's wealth was too large, and their influence too notice­\nable, to be disguised any longer. \nLorenzo solved the problem in his own way by developing the strat­\negy of distraction that has served people of wealth ever since: He became THE FLA ME-COLOREIl \nCLOAK \nDuring the campaign \nof Cambyses in Egypt, \na great many Creeks \nvisited that country for \none reason or another: \nsame, as was to be \nexpected, for trade, \nsame to serve in the \narmy, oth ers, no doubt, \nout of mere curiosity, to \nsee what they could see. \nAmongst the sightseers \nwas Aeaces's san Sylo­\nsan, the exiled brother \nof Polycrates of Samos. \nWhile he was in Egypt, \nSyloson had an extra­\nordinary strake of luck: \nhe was hanging about \nthe streets of Memphis \ndressed in a flame­\ncolored cloak, when \nDarius, who at that \ntime was a member of \nCambyses' s guard and \nnot yet of any particu­\nlar importance, \nhappened to catch \nsight of him and, seized \nwith a sudden longing \nto possess the cloak, \ncame up to Syloson \nand made him an offer \nfor it. \nHis extreme anxiety to \nget it was obvious \nenough to Syloson, \nwho was inspired to \nsay: \"1 am not selling \nthis for any money, but \nif you must have it, 1 \nwill give it to you for \nfree.\" Darius thereupon \nthanked him warmly \nand took it. Syloson at \nthe moment merely \nthought he had lost it \nby his foolish good \nnature; then came the \ndeath of Cambyses and \nthe revolt of the seven \nagainst the Magus, and \nDarius ascended the \nthrone. Syloson now \nLAW 40 341 \nhad the news that the \nman whose request for \nthe jiame-colored cloak \nhe had formerly grati-\nfied in Egypt had \nbecome king of Persia. \nHe hurried to Susa, sat \ndown at the entrance of \nthe royal palace, and \nclaimed to be included \nin the officiallist of the \nking's benefactors. The \nsentry on guard \nreported his claim to \nDarius, who asked in \nsurprise who the man \nmight be. \"For surely,\" \nhe said, \"as I have so \nrecently come to the \nthrone, there cannot be \nany Greek to whom I \nam indebted for a \nservice. Hardly any of \nthem have been here \nyet, and J certainly \ncannot remember \nowing anything to a \nGreek. But bring hirn \nin all the same, that J \nmay know what he \nmeans by this claim. \" \nThe guard escorted \nSyloson into the royal \npresence, and when the \ninterpreters asked hirn \nwho he was and what \nhe had done to justify \nthe statement that he \nwas the king\\· benefac-\ntor, he reminded \nDarills of the story of \nthe cloak, and said that \nhe was the man who \nhad given it hirn. \n\"Sir,\" exclaimed \nDarius, \"you are the \nmost generous of men; \nfor while J was still a \nperson of no power or \nconsequence you gave \nme a present-small \nindeed, but deserving \nthen as much gratitude \nfrom me as would the \nmost splendid of gifts \ntoday. J will give you in \nreturn more si/ver and \ngold than you can \ncount, that you may \n342 LAW 40 the most illustrious patron of the arts that history has ever known. Not only \ndid he spend lavishly on paintings, he ereated Italy's finest apprentiee \nsehools for young artists. It was in one of these schools that the young \nMiehelangelo first eaught the attention of Lorenzo, who invited the artist to \neome and live in his house. He did the same with Leonardo da Vinei. Onee \nunder his wing, Michelange lo and Leonardo requited his generosity by be­\neoming loyal artists in his stable. \nWhenever Lorenzo faeed an enemy, he would wield the weapon of \npatronage. When Pisa, F1orenee's traditional enemy, threatened to rebel \nagainst it in 1472, Lorenzo plaeated its people by pouring money into its \nuniversity, whieh had onee been its pride and joy but had long ago lost its \nluster. The Pisans had no defense against this insidious maneuver, which si­\nmultaneously fed their love of culture and blunted their desire for battle. \nInterpretation \nLorenzo undoubtedly loved the arts, but his patronage of artists had a prae­\ntieal funetion as weH, of whieh he was keenly aware. In F10renee at the \ntime, banking was perhaps the least admired way of making money, and \nwas eertainly not arespected souree of power. The arts were at the other \npole, the pole of quasi-religious transeendenee. By spending on the arts, \nLorenzo diluted people's opinions of the ugly souree of his wealth, disguis­\ning hirnself in nobility. There is no better use of strategie generosity than \nthat of distraeting attention from an unsavory reality and wrapping oneself \nin the mantle of art or religion. \nObservance IV \nLouis XIV had an eagle eye for the strategie power of money. When he \neame to the throne, the powerful nobility had reeently proven a thorn in \nthe monareh y's side, and seethed with rebeHiousness. So he impoverished \nthese aristoerats by making them spend enormous sums on maintaining \ntheir position in the eourt. Making them dependent on royal largesse for \ntheir livelihood, he had them in his claws. \nNext Louis brought the nobles to their knees with strategie generosity. \nIt would work like this: Whenever he notieed a stubborn eourtier whose in­\nfluenee he needed to gain, or whose troublem aking he needed to squelch, \nhe would use his vast wealth to soften the soil. First he would ignore his vie­\ntim, making the man anxious. Then the man would suddenly find that his \nson had been given a weH-paid post, or that funds had been spent liberally \nin his horne region, or that he had been given a painting he had long cov­\neted. Presents would flow from Louis's hands. Finally, weeks or months \nlater, Louis would ask for the favor he had needed all along. A man who \nhad onee vowed to do anything to stop the king would find he had lost the \ndesire to fight. A straightfo rward bribe would have made him rebeHious; \nthis was far more insidious. Facing hardened earth in whieh nothing eould \ntake root, Louis loosened the soil before he planted his seeds. \nInterpretation \nLouis understood that there is a deep-rooted emotional element in our atti­\ntude to money, an element going baek to ehildhood. When we are ehil-\ndren, all kinds of complicated feelings about oUf parents center around \ngifts; we see the giving of a gift as a sign of love and approval. And that \nemotional element never goes away. The recipients of gifts, financial or \notherwise, are suddenly as vulnerable as children, especially when the gift \ncomes from someone in authority. They cannot help opening up; their will \nis loosened, as Louis loosened the soil. \nTo succeed best, the gift should come out of the blue. It should be re­\nmarkable for the fact that a gift like it has never been given before, or for \nbeing preceded by a cold shoulder from the giver. The more often you give \nto particular people, the blunter this weapon becomes. If they don't take \nyour gifts for granted, becoming monsters of ingratitude, they will resent \nwhat appears to be charity. The sudden, unexpected, one-time gift will not \nspoil YOUf children; it will keep them under YOUf thumb. \nObservance V \nThe antique dealer Fushimiya, who lived in the city of Edo (former name \nfor Tokyo) in the seventeenth century, once made a stop at a village tea­\nhouse. After enjoying a cup of tea, he spent several minutes scrutinizing the \ncup, which he eventually paid for and took away with hirn. A local artisan, \nwatehing this, waited until Fushimiya left the shop, then approached the old \nwoman who owned the teahouse and asked her who this man was. She told \nhirn it was Japan's most famous connoisseur, antique dealer to the lord of \nIzumo. The artisan ran out of the shop, caught up with Fushimiya, and \nbegged hirn to seIl hirn the cup, which must clearly be valuable if Fushimiya \njudged it so. Fushimiya laughed heartily: \"It's just an ordinary cup of Bizen \nware,\" he explained, \"and it is not valuable at all. The reason I was looking \nat it was that the steam seemed to hang about it strangely and I wondered if \nthere wasn't a leak somewhere .\" (Devotees of the Tea Ceremony were in­\nterested in any odd or accidental beauty in nature.) Since the artisan still \nseemed so excited about it, Fushirniya gave hirn the cup for free. \nThe artisan took the cup around, trying to find an expert who would \nappraise it at a high price, but since all of them recognized it as an ordinary \nteacup he got nowhere. Soon he was neglecting his own business, thinking \nonly of the cup and the fortune it could bring. Finally he went to Edo to \ntalk to Fushimiya at his shop. There the dealer, realizing that he had inad­\nvertently caused this man pain by making hirn believe the cup had great \nworth, paid hirn 100 ryo (gold pieces) for the cup as a kindness. The cup \nwas indeed mediocre, but he wanted to rid the artisan of his obsession, \nwhile also allowing hirn to feel that his effort had not been wasted. The ar­\ntisan thanked hirn and went on his way. \nSoon word spread of Fushimiya's pUfchase of the teacup. Every dealer \nin Japan clamored for hirn to seIl it, since a cup he had bought for 100 ryo \nmust be worth much more. He tried to explain the circumsta nces in which \nhe had bought the cup, but the dealers could not be dissuaded. Fushimiya \nfinally relented and put the cup up for sale. \nDuring the auction, two buyers simultaneously bid 200 ryo for the \nteacup, and then began to fight over who had bid first. Their fighting never regret that yuu \nunce did a favur to \nDarius the son of \nHystaspes. \" \"My lord,\" \nreplied Syloson, \"do \nnot give me gold or \nsilver, but recover \nSamos fur me, my \nnative island, which \nnow since Oroetes \nkilled my brother Poly­\ncrates is in the hands \nof one of our servants. \nLet Samos be your gift \nto me-but let no man \nin the island be killed \nor enslaved. \" \nDarius consented to \nSyloson 's request, and \ndispatched a force \nunder the command \nof Otanes, one of the \nseven, with orders to do \neverything that Syloson \nhad asked. \nTHE HISTORIES, \nHERODOTUS, \nFIFTH CENTURY B.C. \nM oney is never spent to \nso much advantage as \nwhen you have been \ncheated out of it;for at \none stroke you have \npurchased prudence. \nARTHUR \nSCHOPENHAUER, \n1788-1860 \nLAW 40 343 \nA LIFT OF FISII \nKung-yi Hsiu, premier \nof Lu, was fond offish. \nTherefore, people in \nthe whole country \nconsäentiously bought \nfish, wh ich they \npresented to him. \nHowever, Kung-yi \nwould not accept the \npresents. Against such a \nstep his younger \nbrother remonstrated \nwith him and said: \n\"You like fish, indeed. \nWhy don't you accept \nthe present offish?\" In \nreply, he said: \"It is \nsolely because I like \nfish that I would not \naccept the fish they \ngave me. \nIndeed, if I accept the \nfish, I will be placed \nunder an obligation to \nthem.

The auction was clearly over. Fushimiya glued and mended the \ncup, then stored it away, thinking the affair finished. Years later, however, \nthe great tea master Matsudaira Fumai visited the store, and asked to see \nthe cup, which by then had become legendary. Fumai examin ed it. \"As a \npiece,\" he said, \"it is not up to much, but a Tea Master prizes sentiment and \nassociation more than intrinsic val ue.\" He bought the cup for a high sumo \nA glued-together work of less than ordinary craftsmanship had become \none of the most famous objects in Japan. \nInterpretation \nThe story shows, first, an essential aspect of money: That it is humans who \nhave created it and humans who instill it with meaning and valu e. Second, \nwith objects as with money, what the courtier most values are the senti­\nments and emotions embedded in them-these are what make them worth \nhaving. The lesson is simple: The more your gifts and your acts of generos­\nity play with sentiment, the more powernd they are. The object or concept \nthat plays with a charged emotion or hits a chord of sentiment has more \npower than the money you squander on an expensive yet lifeless present. \nObser vance VI \nAkimoto Suzut omo, a wealthy adherent of the tea ceremony, once gave his \npage 100 ryo (gold pieces) and instructed him to purchase a tea bowl of­\nfered by a partic ular dealer. When the page saw the bowl, he doubted it \nwas worth that much, and after much bargaining got the price reduced to \n95 ryo. Days later, after Suzutomo had put the bowl to use, the page \nproudly told hirn what he had done. \n\"What an ignoramus you are!\" replied Suzut omo. \"A tea bowl that \nanyone asks 100 pieces of gold for can only be a family heirloom, and a \nthing like that is only sold when the family is pressed for money. And in \nthat case they will be hoping to find someone who will give even 150 \npie ces for it. So what sort of fellow is it who does not consider their feel­\nings ? Quite apart from that, a curio that you give 100 ryo for is someth ing \nworth having, but one that has only cost 95 gives a mean impression. So \nnever let me see that tea bowl again !\" And he had the bowl locked away, \nand never took it out. \nInterpretation \nWhen you insist on paying less, you may save your five ryo, but the insult \nyou cause and the cheap impression you create will cost you in reputation, \nwhich is the thing the powerful prize above all. Leam to pay the full \nprice-it will save you a lot in the end. \nObs ervance VII \nSometime near the beginning of the seventeenth century in Japan, a group \nof generals whiled away the time before a big battle by staging an incense­\nsmelling competition. Each participant anted up a prize for the contest's \nwinners-b ows, arrows, saddles, and other items a warrior would covet. \nThe great Lord Date Masamune happened to pass by and was induced to \nparticipate. For a prize, he offered the gourd that hung from his belt. Every­\none laughed, for no one wanted to win this cheap item. A retainer of the \nhost finally accepted the gourd. \nWhen the party broke up, however, and the generals were chatting \noutside the tent, Masamune brought over his magnificent horse and gave it \nto the retainer. \"There,\" he said, \"a horse has come out of the gourd.\" The \nstunned generals suddenly regretted their seorn at Masamune's gift. \nInterpretation \nMasamune understood the following: Money gives its possessor the ability \nto give pleasure to others. The more you can do this, the more you attract \nadmiration. When you make a horse come out of a gourd, you give the ul­\ntimate demonstration of your power. \nImage: The River. To protect \nyourself or to save the resource, \nyou dam it up. Soon, however, \nthe waters become dank and \npestilent. Only the foulest \nforms of life can live in such \nstagnant waters; nothing trav­\neIs on them, all commerce \nstops. Destroy the dam. When \nwater flows and circulates, it gen­\nerates abundance, wealth, and \npower in ever larger circles. The \nRiver must flood periodically \nfor good things to flourish. \nAuthority : The great man who is a miser is a great fool, and a man in \nhigh places can have no vice so harmful as avarice. A miserly man can \nconquer neither lands nor lordships, for he does not have a plentiful \nsupply of friends with whom he may work his will. Whoever wants to \nhave friends must not love his possessions but must acquire friends by \nmeans of fair gifts; for in the same way that the lodestone subtly draws \niran to itself, so the gold and silver that a man gives attract the hearts \nof men. (The Roma nce ofthe Rose, Guillaume de Lorris, c. 1200-1238) I took money only \nfrom those who cnuld \nafford it and were will­\ning to go in wirh me in \nsehern es they fancied \nwould fleece others. \nThey wanted money \nfor its own sake.

Leam to pay, then, \nand to pay weIl. \nOn the other hand, this Law offers great opportunities for swindling \nand deception if you apply it from the other side. Dangling the lure of a \nfree lunch is the con artist's stock in trade. \nNo man was better at this than the most successful con artist of our \nage, Joseph Weil, a.k.a. \"The Yellow Kid.\" The Yellow Kid leamed early \nthat what made his swindles possible was his fellow humans' greed. \"This \ndesire to get something for nOthing,\" he once wrote, \"has been very costly \nto many people who have dealt with me and with other con men. . . . \nWhen people leam-as I doubt they will-that they can't get something \nfor nOthing, crime will diminish and we shall all live in greater harmony.\" \nOver the years Weil devised many ways to seduce people with the prospect \nof easy money. He would hand out \"free\" real estate-wh o could resist \nsuch an offer?-and then the suckers would leam they had to pay $25 to \nregister the sale. Since the land was free, it seemed worth the high fee, and \nthe Yellow Kid would make thousands of dollars on the phony registration. \nIn exchange he would give his suckers a phony deed. Other times, he \nwould tell suckers about a fixed horse race, or a stock that would eam 200 \npercent in a few weeks. As he spun his stories he would watch the sucker's \neyes open wide at the thought of a free lunch. \nThe lesson is simple: Bait your deceptions with the possibility of easy \nmoney. People are essentially lazy, and want wealth to fall in their lap \nrather than to work for it. For a small sum, seIl them advice on how to \nmake millions (P. T. Bamum did this later in life), and that small sum will \nbecome a fortune when multiplied by thousands of suckers. Lure people in \nwith the prospect of easy money and you have the room to work still more \ndeceptions on them, since greed is powerful enough to blind your victims \nto anything. And as the Yellow Kid said, half the fun is teaching a moral \nlesson: Greed does not pay. \nLAW \n41 \nAV OID STEP PING INTO \nA GR EAT MA N'S SHOES \nJUDGMENT \nTVhat happens first always appears better and more orig­\ninal than what comes after.

Louis XIV had transformed a country on the verge of civil war into \nthe preeminent power in Europe. The last years of his reign had been diffi­\ncuIt-he had been old and tired-but it was hoped that the child would de­\nvelop into the kind of strong mler who would reinvigorate the land and \nadd to the firm foundation that Louis XIV had laid. \nTo this end the child was given the best minds of France as his tutors, \nmen who would instruct hirn in the arts of statecraft, in the methods that \nthe Sun King had perfected. Nothing was neglected in his education. But \nwhen Louis XV came to the throne, in 1726, a sudden change came over \nhirn: He no longer had to study or please others or prove hirnself. He stood \nalone at the top of a great country, with wealth and power at his command. \nHe could do as he wished. \nIn the first years of his reign, Louis gave hirns elf over to pleasure, leav­\ning the government in the hands of a trusted minister, Andre-Hercule de \nFleury. This caused little concern, for he was a young man who needed to \nsow his wild oats, and de Fleury was a good minister. But it slowly became \nclear that this was more than a passing phase. Louis had no interest in gov­\nerning. His main worry was not France's finances, or a possible war with \nSpain, but boredom. He could not stand being bored, and when he was not \nhunting deer, or chasing young girls, he whiled away bis time at the gam­\nbling tables, losing huge sums in a single night. \nThe court, as usual, reflected the tastes of the mler. Gambling and lav­\nish parties became the obsession. The courtiers had no concern with the fu­\nture of France-they poured their energies into charming the king, angling \nfor tides that would bring them life pensions, and for cabinet positions de­\nmanding litde work but paying huge salaries. Parasites flocked to the court, \nand the state's debts swelled. \nIn 1745 Louis fell in love with Madame de Pompadour, a woman of \nmiddle-class origin who had managed to rise through her charms, her intel­\nligence, and a good marriage . Madame de Pompadour became the official \nroyal mistress; she also became France's arbiter of taste and fashion. But \nthe Madame had political ambitions as weIl, and she eventually emerged \nas the country's unofficial prime minister-it was she, not Louis, who \nwielded hiring-and-firing power over France's most important ministers. \nAs he grew older Louis only needed more diversion. On the grounds \nof Versailles he built a brothel, Parc aux Cerfs, which housed some of the \nprettiest young girls of France. Underground passages and hidden stair­\ncases gave Louis access at all hours. Mter Madame de Pompadour died, in \n1764, she was succeeded as royal mistress by Madame du Barry, who soon \ncame to dominate the court, and who, like de Pompadour before her, \nbegan to meddle in affairs of state. If a minister did not please her he would \nfind himselffired. All ofEurope was aghast when du Barry, the daughter of \na baker, managed to arrange the firing of Etienne de Choiseul, the foreign \nminister and France's most able diplomat. He had shown her too litde re­\nspect. As time went by, swindlers and charlatans made their nests in Ver­\nsailles, and enticed Louis's interest in astrology, the occult, and fraudulent \nbusiness deals. The young and pampered teenager who had taken over \nFrance years before had only grown worse with age. \nThe motto that became attached to Louis's reign was ''Apres moi, le \ndeluge'!.-\"After me the flood,\" or, Let France rot after I am gone. And in­\ndeed when Louis did go, in 1774, worn out by debauchery, his country and \nhis own finances were in horrible disarray. His grandson Louis XVI inher­\nited arealm in desperate need of reform and a strong leader. But Louis \nXVI was even weaker than his grandfather, and could only watch as the \ncountry descended into revolut ion. In 1792 the republic introduced by the \nFrench Revolution declared the end of the monarchy, and gave the king a \nnew name, \"Louis the Last.\" A few months later he kneeled on the guillo­\ntine, his about-to-be-severed head stripped of all the radiance and power \nthat the Sun King had invested in the crown. \nInterpretation \nFrom a country that had descended into civil war in the late 1640s, Louis \nXIV forged the mightiest realm in Europe. Great generals would tremble \nin his presence. A cook once made amistake in preparing a dish and com­\nmitted suicide rather than face the king's wrath. Louis XIV had many mis­\ntresses, but their power ended in the bedroom. He filled his court with the \nmost brilliant minds of the age. The symbol of his power was Versailles: \nRefusing to accept the palace of his forefathers, the Louvre, he built his \nown palace in what was then the middle of nowhere, symbolizing that this \nwas a new order he had founded, one without precedent. He made Ver­\nsailles the centerpiece of his reign, a place that all the powernd of Europe \nenvied and visited with a sense of awe. In essence, Louis took a great \nvoid-the decaying monarchy of France-and filled it with his own sym­\nbols and radiant power. \nLouis XV, on the other hand, symbolizes the fate of all those who in­\nherit something large or who follow in a great man's footsteps. It would \nseem easy for a son or successor to build on the grand foundation left for \nthem, but in the realm of power the opposite is true. The pampered, in­\ndulged son alm ost always squanders the inheritan ce, for he does not start \nwith the father's need to fill a void. As Machiavelli states, necessity is what \nimpels men to take action, and once the necessity is gone, only rot and \ndecay are left. Having no need to increase his store of power, Louis XV in­\nevitably succumbed to inertia. Under him, Versailles, the symbol of the \nSun King's authority, became a pleasure palace of incomparable banality, \na kind of Las Vegas of the Bourbon monarchy. It came to represent all that \nthe oppressed peasantry of France hated about their king, and during the \nRevolution they looted it with glee. \nLouis XV had only one way out of the trap awaiting the son or succes­\nsor of a man like the Sun King: to psychologically begin from nothing, to LIF E OF PERICLES \nAs a young man Peri­\neies was ineiined to \nshrink from facing the \npeople.

The \nfact that he was rich \nand that he came of a \ndistinguished family \nand possessed exceed­\ningly powerful friends \nmade the fear of \nostracism very real to \nhim, and at the begin­\nning of his career he \ntook no part in politics \nbut devoted himself to \nsoldiering, in wh ich he \nshowed great daring \nand enterprise. \nHowever , the time came \nwhen Aristides was \ndead, Themistoeies in \nexile, and Cimon \nfrequently absent on \ndistant campaigns. \nThen at last Pericles \ndecided to at/ach \nhimselfto the people's \nparty and to take up \nthe cause of the poor \nand the many instead \nofthat ofthe rich and \nthe few, in spite of the \nfact that this was quite \ncontrary to his own \ntemperament, wh ich \nwas thoroughly aristo­\ncratic.

Assuming you have the choice, it would be \nbetter to avoid the situation altogether, to place yourself where there is a \nvacuum of power, where you can be the one to bring order out of chaos \nwithout having to compete with another star in the sky. Power depends on \nappearing larger than other people, and when you are lost in the shadow of \nthe father, the king, the great predecessor, you cannot possibly project such \napresence. \nBut when they began to make sovereignt y hereditar y, the children quickl y \ndegenerated from their fathers; and, so far Jrom trying to equal their father' s \nvirtues, they consi dered that a prince had nothing else to do than to excel \nalt the rest in idleness, indul gence, and every other variety of pleasur e. \nNiccolo Machiavel li, J469�152 7 \nOBSER VANCE OF THE LAW \nAlexander the Great had a dominant passion as a young man-an intense \ndislike for his father, King Philip of Macedonia. He hated Philip's cunning, \ncautious style of ruling, his bombastic speeches, his drinking and whoring, \nand his love of wrestling and of other wastes of time. Alexander knew he \nhad to make hirnself the very opposite of his domineering father: He would \nforce hirnself to be bold and reckless, he would control his tongue and be a \nman of few words, and he would not lose precious time in pursuit of plea­\nsures that brought no glory. Alexander also resented the fact that Philip \nhad conquered most of Greece: \"My father will go on conquering till there \nis nothing extraordinary left for me to do,\" he once complain ed. While \nother sons of powerful men were content to inherit wealth and live a life of \nleisure, Alexander wanted only to outdo his father, to obliterate Philip's \nname from history by surpassing his accomplishments . \nAlexander itched to show others how superior he was to his father. A \nThessalian horse-dealer once brought a prize horse named Bucepha lus to \nseIl to Philip. None of the king's grooms could get near the horse--it was \nfar too savage-and Philip berated the merchant for bringing him such a \nuseless be ast. Watching the whole affair, Alexander scowled and COffi­\nmented, \"What a horse they are losing for want of skill and spirit to man­\nage hirn!\" When he had said this several times, Philip had finally had \nenough, and challenged hirn to take on the horse. He called the merchant \nback, secretly hoping his son would have a nasty fall and leam a bitter les­\nson. But Alexander was the one to teach the lesson: Not only did he mount \nBucephal us, he managed to ride hirn at full gallop, taming the horse that \nwould later carry hirn all the way to India. The courtiers applauded wildly, \nbut Philip seethed inside, seeing not a son but a riyal to his power. \nAlexander's defiance of his father grew bolder. One day the two men \nhad a heated argument before the entire court, and Philip drew his sword \nas if to strike his son; having drunk too much wine, however, the king \nstumbled. Alexander pointed at his father and jeered, \"Men of Macedonia, \nsee there the man who is preparing to pass from Europe to Asia. He cannot \npass from one table to another without falling.\" \nWhen Alexander was eighteen, a disgruntled courtier murdered \nPhilip. As word of the regicide spread through Greece, city after city rose \nup in rebellion against their Macedonian rulers. Philip's advisers counseled \nAlexan der, now the king, to proceed cautiously, to do as Philip had done \nand conquer through cunning. But Alexander would do things his way: He \nmarched to the furthest reaches of the kingdom, suppressed the rebellious \ntowns, and reunited the empire with brutal efficiency. \nAs a young rebel grows older, his struggle against the father often \nwanes, and he gradually comes to resemble the very man he had wanted to \ndefy. But Alexander' s loathing of his father did not end with Philip' s death. \nOnce he had consolidated Greece, he set his eyes on Persia, the prize that \nhad eluded his father, who had dreamed of conquering Asia. If he defeated \nthe Persians, Alexander would finally surpass Philip in glory and fame. \nAlexander crossed into Asia with an army of 35,000 to face a Persian \nforce numbering over a million. Before engaging the Persians in battle he \npassed through the town of Gordium. Here, in the town's main temple, \nthere stood an ancient chariot tied with cords made of the rind of the cor­\nnel tree. Legend had it that any man who could undo these cords--the \nGordian knot-would rule the world. Many had tried to untie the enor­\nmous and intricate knot, but none had succeeded. Alexander, seeing he \ncould not possibly untie the knot with his bare hands, took out his sword \nand with one slash cut it in half. This symbolic ge sture showed the world \nthat he would not do as others, but would blaze his own path. \nAgainst astounding odds, Alexander conquered the Persians. Most ex­\npected hirn to stop there-it was a great triumph, enough to secure his \nfarne for etemity. But Alexander had the same relationship to his own \ndeeds as he had to his father: His conquest of Persia represented the past, \nand he wanted never to rest on past triumphs, or to allow the past to out­\nshine the present. He moved on to India, extending his empire beyond all \nknown limits. Only his disgruntled and weary soldiers prevented hirn from \ngoing farther. \nInterpretati on \nAlexan der represents an extremely uncommon type in history: the son of \na famous and successful man who manages to surpass the father in glory \nand power. The reason this type is uncommon is simple: The father most \noften manages to amass his fortune, his kingdom, because he begins with \nlittle or nothing. Adesperate urge impels hirn to succeed -he has nothing \nto lose by cunning and impetuousness, and has no famous father of his \nown to compete against. This kind of man has reason to believe in \nhimself -to believe that his way of doing things is the best, because, after \nall, it worked for hirn. \nWhen a man like this has a son, he becomes domineering and oppres­\nsive, imposing his lessons on the son, who is starting off life in circum­\nstances totally different from those in which the father hirns elf began. the study ofhis profes­\nsion.

If you cannot materially start from ground zero-it would be foolish \nto renounce an inheritance-you can at least begin from ground zero psy­\nchologically, by throwing off the weight of the past and charting a new di­\nrection. Alexander instinctively recognized that privileges of birth are \nimpediments to power. Be merciless With the past, then-not only with \nyour father and his father but with your own earlier achievements _ Only \nthe weak rest on their laureis and dote on past triumphs; in the game of \npower there is never time to rest \nKEYS TO POWER \nIn many ancient kingdoms, for example Bengal and Sumatra, after the \nking had ruled for several years his subjects would execute hirn. This was \ndone partly as a ritual of renewal, but also to prevent hirn from growing too \npowerful-for the king would generally try to establish a permanent order, \nat the expense of other families and of his own sons. Instead of protecting \nthe tribe and leading it in times of war, he would attempt to dominate it. \nAnd so he would be beaten to death, or executed in an elaborate ritual. \nNow that he was no longer around for his honors to go to his head, he \ncould be worshipped as a god_ Meanwhile the field had been cleared for a \nnew and youthful order to establish itself. \nThe ambivalent, hostile attitude towards the king or father figure also \nfinds expression in legends of heroes who do not know their father. Moses, \nthe archetyp al man of power, was found abandoned among the bulrushes \nand never knew his parents; without a father to compete with hirn or limit \nhirn, he could attain the heights of power. Hercules had no earthly father­\nhe was the son of the god Zeus. Later in his life Alexander the Great spread \nthe story that the god Jupiter Ammon had sired hirn, not Philip of Mace­\ndon_ Legends and rituals like these eliminate the human father because he \nsymbolizes the destructive power of the past \nThe past prevents the young hero from creating his own world-he \nmust do as his father did, even after that father is dead or powerless. The \nhero must bow and scrape before his predecessor and yield to tradition \nand precedent What had success in the past must be carried over to the \npresent, even though circumsta nces have greatly changed. The past also \nweighs the hero down with an inheritance that he is terrified of losing, \nmaking hirn timid and cauti ous. \nPower depends on the ability to fill a void, to occupy a field that has \nbeen cleared of the dead weight of the past. Only after the father figure has \nbeen properly done away with will you have the necessary space to create \nand establish a new order. There are several strategies you can adopt to ac­\ncomplish this-variations on the execution of the king that disguise the vio­\nlence of the impulse by channeling it in socially acceptable forms. \nPerhaps the simplest way to escape the shadow of the past is simply to \nbelittle it, playing on the timeless antagonism between the generations, stir­\nring up the young against the old. For this you need a convenient older fig­\nure to pillory. Mao Tse-tung, confronting a culture that fiercely resisted \nchange, played on the suppressed resentment against the overbearing pres­\nence of the venerable Confucius in Chinese culture. John F. Kennedy \nknew the dangers of getting lost in the past; he radically distinguished his \npresidency from that of his predecessor, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and also \nfrom the preceding decade, the 1950s, which Eisenhower personified. \nKennedy, for instance, would not play the dull and fatherly game of golf­\nasymbol ofretirement and privilege, and Eisenhower' s passion. Instead he \nplayed football on the White House lawn. In every aspect his administra­\ntion represented vigor and youth, as opposed to the stodgy Eisenhow er. \nKennedy had discovered an old truth: The young are easily set against the \nold, since they yearn to make their own place in the world and resent the \nshadow of their fathers. \nThe distance you establish from your predecessor often demands \nsome symbolism, a way of advertising itself publicly. Louis XIV, for exam­\npIe, created such symbolism when he rejected the traditional palace of the \nFrench kings and built his own palace of Versailles. King Philip 11 of Spain \ndid the same when he created his center of power, the palace of EI Esco­\nrial, in what was then the middle of nowhere. But Louis carried the game \nfurther: He would not be a king like his father or earlier ancestors, he \nwould not wear a crown or carry a scepter or sit on a throne, he would es­\ntablish a new kind of imposing authority with symbols and rituals of its \nown. Louis made his ancestors' rituals into laughable relics of the past. Fol­\nlow his example: Never let yourself be seen as following your predeces­\nsor's path. If you do you will never surpass him. You must physically \ndemonstrate your difference, by establishing a style and symbolism that \nsets you apart. \nThe Roman emperor Augustus, successor to Julius Caesar, understood \nthis thoroughly. Caesar had been a great general, a theatrical figure whose \nspectacles kept the Romans entertained, an international emissary seduced \nby the charms of Cleopa tra-a larger-than-life figure. So Augustus, despite \nbis own theatrical tendencies, competed with Caesar not by trying to outdo \nbim but by differentiating hirnself from hirn: He based his power on a re­\nturn to Roman simplicity, an austerity of both style and substance. Against \nthe memory of Caesar's sweeping presence Augustus posed a quiet and \nmanly dignity. \nThe problem with the overbearing predecessor is that he fills the vistas \nbefore you with symbols of the past. You have no room to create your own \nname. To deal with this situation you need to hunt out the vacuums-t hose cant that [nineteenth­\ncentury chess cham­\npion Paul} Morphy 's \nsoaring odyssey ;nto \nthe higher realms of \nchess began just a year \nafter the unexpectedly \nsudden death of his \nfather, which had been \na great shock to hirn, \nand we may surm;se \nthat his brilliant effort \nofsublimation was, like \nShakespeare's Harnlet \nand Freud's The Inter­\npretation of Drearns, a \nreaction to this critical \nevent .... \nSomething should now \nbe said aboutthe recep­\ntion Morphy 's \nsuccesses met with, for \nthey were of such a \nkind as to raise the \nquestion whether his \nsubsequent collapse \nmay not have been \ninfluenced through his \nperhaps belonging to \nthe type that Freud has \ndescribed under the \nname of Die arn \nErfolge scheitern \n(\"Those wrecked by \nsuccess\") ....

To \ncastrate the father in a \ndream is a very di ffer­\nent matter from do;ng \nit in reality. The real \nsituation provokes the \nunconscious guilt in its \nfull force, and the \npenalty may be mental \ncollapse. \nTHE PROBLEM OF PAUL \nMORPHY, \nERNEST JONES, \n1951 \nLAW 41 353 \n354 LAW 41 areas in culture that have been left vacant and in which you can become \nthe first and principal figure to shine. \nWhen Pericles of Athens was about to launch a career as astatesman, \nhe looked for the one thing that was missing in Athenian politics. Most of \nthe great politicians of his time had allied themselves with the aristocracy; \nindeed Pericles himself had aristocratic tendencies. Yet he decided to throw \nin his hat with the city's democratic elements. The choice had nothing to \ndo with his personal beliefs, but it launched him on a brilliant career. Out \nof necessity he became a man of the people. Instead of competing in an \narena filled with great leaders both past and present, he would make a \nname for himself where no shadows could obscure his presence. \nWhen the painter Diego de Veläzquez began his career, he knew he \ncould not compete in refinement and technique with the great Renaissance \npainters who had come before him. Instead he chose to work in a style that \nby the standards of the time seemed coarse and rough, in a way that had \nnever been seen before. And in this style he excelled. There were mem­\nbers of the Spanish court who wanted to demonstrate their own break with \nthe past; the newness of Veläzquez's style thrilled them. Most people are \nafraid to break so boldly with tradition, but they secretly admire those who \ncan break up the old forms and reinvigorate the culture. This is why there \nis so much power to be gained from entering vacuums and voids. \nThere is a kind of stubbom stupidity that recurs throughout history, \nand is a strong impediment to power: The superstitious belief that if the \nperson before you succeeded by doing A, B, and C, you can re-create their \nsuccess by doing the same thing. This cookie-cutter approach will seduce \nthe uncreative, for it is easy, and appeals to their timidity and their laziness. \nBut circumsta nces never repeat themselves exactly. \nWhen General Douglas MacArthur assumed command of American \nforces in the Philippin es during World War II, an assistant handed him a \nbook containing the various precedents established by the commanders \nbefore hirn, the methods that had been successful for them. MacArthur \nasked the assistant how many copies there were of this book. Six, the assis­\ntant answered. \"WeIl,\" the general replied, \"you get all those six copies to­\ngether and bum them-every one of them. I'll not be . bound by \nprecedents. Any time a problem comes up, I'll make the decision at \nonce-immediately. \" Adopt this ruthless strategy toward the past: Bum all \nthe books, and train yourself to react to circumsta nces as they happen. \nYou may believe that you have separated yourself from the predeces­\nsor or father figure, but as you grow older you must be etemally vigilant \nlest you become the father you had rebelIed against. As a young man, Mao \nTse-tung disliked his father and in the struggle against hirn found his own \nidentity and a new set of values. But as he aged, his father's ways crept back \nin. Mao's father had valued manual work over intellect; Mao had scoffed at \nthis as a young man, but as he grew older he unconsciously retumed to his \nfather's views and echoed such outdated ideas by forcing a whole genera­\ntion of Chinese intellectuals into manual labor, a nightrnarish mistake that \ncost his regime dearly. Remember: You are your own father. Do not let \nyourself spend years creating yourself only to let your guard down and \nallow the ghost of the past-father, habit, history-to sneak back in. \nFinally, as noted in the story of Louis XV, plenitude and prosperity \ntend to make us lazy and inactive: When our power is secure we have no \nneed to act. This is a serious danger, especially for those who achieve suc­\ncess and power at an early age. The playwright Tennessee Williarns, for in­\nstance, found hirnself skyrocketed from obscu rity to farne by the success of \nThe Glass Menagerie. \"The sort of life which I had had previous to this popu­\nlar success,\" he later wrote, \"was one that required enduranc e, a life of \nclawing and scratching, but it was a good life because it was the sort of life \nfor which the human organism is created. I was not aware of how much \nvital energy had gone into this struggle until the struggle was removed. \nThis was security at last. I sat down and looked about me and was suddenly \nvery depressed.\" Williarns had a nervous breakdown, which may in fact \nhave been necessary for hirn: Pushed to the psychological edge, he could \nstart writing with the old vitality again, and he produced A Streetcar Named \nDesire. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, similarly, whenever he wrote a successful \nnovel, would feel that the financial security he had gained made the act of \ncreation unnecessary. He would take his entire savings to the casino and \nwould not leave until he had garnbled away his last penny. Once reduced \nto poverty he could write again. \nIt is not necessary to go to such extremes, but you must be prepared to \nreturn to square one psychologically rather than growing fat and lazy with \nprosperity. Pablo Picasso could deal with success, but only by constantly \nchanging the style of his painting, often breaking completely with what \nhad made hirn successful before. How often our early triumphs turn us \ninto a kind of caricature of ourselves. Powerful people recognize these \ntraps; like Alexander the Great, they struggle constantly to re-create them­\nselves. The father must not be allowed to return; he must be slain at every \nstep of the way. \nImage: The Father. He casts a \ngiant shadow over his children, \nkeeping them in thrall long \nafter he is gone by tying them \nto the past, squashing their \nyouthful spirit, and forcing \nthem down the same tired path \nhe followed hirnself. His tricks \nare many. At every cross­\nroads you must slay the father \nand step out of his shadow. \nLAW 41 355 \n356 LAW 41 REVERSAL Authority: Beware of stepping into a \ngreat man's shoes-you will have to \naccomplish twice as much to surpass \nhirn.

The newest ones can be \narduous, but they are often shortcuts to \ngreatness. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) \nThe shadow of a great predecessor could be used to advantage if it is cho­\nsen as a trick, a tactic that can be discarded once it has brought you power. \nNapoleon III used the name and legend of his illustrious grand-unde \nNapoleon Bonaparte to help hirn become first president and then emperor \nof France. Once on the throne, however, he did not stay tied to the past; he \nquickly showed how different his reign would be, and was careful to keep \nthe public from expecting hirn to attain the heights that Bonaparte had at­\ntained. \nThe past often has elements worth appropriating, qualities that would \nbe foolish to reject out of a need to distinguish yourself. Even Alexander \nthe Great recognized and was influenced by his father's skill in organizing \nan army. Making a display of doing things differently from your predeces­\nsor can make you seem childish and in fact out of control, unless your ac­\ntions have a logic of their OWll. \nJoseph 11, son of the Austrian empress Maria Theresa, made a show of \ndoing the exact opposite of his mother-dressing like an ordinary citizen, \nstaying in inns instead of palaces, appearing as the \"people's emperor.\" \nMaria Theresa, on the other hand, had been regal and aristocratic. The \nproblem was that she had also been beloved, an empress who mIed wisely \nafter years of learning the hard way. If you have the kind of intelligence \nand instinct that will point you in the right direction, playing the rebel will \nnot be danger ous. But if you are mediocre, as Joseph II was in comparison \nto his mother, you are better off leaming from your predecessor's knowl­\nedge and experience, which are based on something real. \nFinally, it is often wise to keep an eye on the young, YOUf future rivals \nin power. Just as you try to rid yourself of your father, they will soon play \nthe same trick on you, denigrating everything you have accompli shed. Just \nas you rise by rebelling against the past, keep an eye on those rising from \nbelow, and never give them the chance to do the same to you. \nThe great Baroque artist and architect Pietro Bemini was a master at \nsniffing out younger potential rivals and keeping them in his shadow. One \nday a young stonemason named Francesco Borromini showed Bemini his \narchitectural sketche s. Recognizing his talent immediately, Bemini in­\nstantly hired Borromini as his assistant, which delighted the young man but \nwas actually only a tactic to keep him elose at hand, so that he could play \npsychological games on him and create in hirn a kind of inferiority com­\nplex. And indeed, despite Borromini's brilliance, Bemini has the greater \nfarne. His strategy with Borromini he made a lifelong practice: Fearing that \nthe great sculptor Alessandro Algardi, for example, would eelipse hirn in \nfarne, he arranged it so that Algardi could only find work as his assistant . \nAnd any assistant who rebelled against Bemini and tried to strike out on \nhis own would find his career ruined. \nLAW 41 357 \n358 LAW \n42 \nSTRI KE THE SHE PHER D \nAND THE SH EE P \nWI LL SC AT TER \nJUDGM ENT \nTrouble can oJten be traced to a single strong individ­\nual-the stirrer; the arrogant underling, the poisoner oJ \ngoodwill.

It es­\ntablished instead a democracy that was to last over a century, a democ­\nracy that became the source of its power and its proudest achievement. \nBut as the democracy evolved, so did a problem the Athenians had never \nfaced: How to deal with those who did not concern themselves with the \ncohesion of a small city surrounded by enemies, who did not work for its \ngreater glory, but thought of only themselves and their own ambitions and \npetty intrig ues? The Athenians understood that these people, if left alone, \nwould sow dissension, divide the city into factions, and stir up anxieties, \nall of which could lead to the ruin of their democracy. \nViolent punishment no longer suited the new, civilized order that \nAthens had created. Instead the citizens found another, more satisfying, \nand less brutal way to deal with the chronically selfish: Every year they \nwould gather in the marketplace and write on a piece of earthenware, an \nostrakon, the name of an individual they wanted to see banished from the \ncity for ten years. If a particular name appeared on six thousand ballots, \nthat person would instantly be exiled. If no one received six thousand \nvotes, the person with the most ostraka recording his name would suffer \nthe ten-year \"ostracism.\" This ritual expulsion became a kind of festival­\nwhat a joy to be able to banish those irritating, anxiety-inducing individu­\nals who wanted to rise above the group they should have served. \nIn 490 B.C., Aristides, one of the great generals of Athenian history, \nhelped defeat the Persians at the battle of Marathon. Meanwhile, off the \nbattlefield, his fairness as a judge had eamed hirn the nickname \"The \nJust.\" But as the years went by the Athenians came to dislike hirn. He \nmade such a show of his righteousness, and this, they believed, disguised \nhis feelings of superiority and scorn for the common folk. His omnipres­\nence in Athenian politics became obnoxious; the citizens grew tired of \nhearing hirn called \"The Just.\" They feared that this was just the type of \nman-judgmental, haughty-who would eventually stir up fierce divi­\nsions among them. In 482 B.C., despite Aristides' invaluable expertise in \nthe continuing war with the Persians, they collected the ostraka and had \nhirn banished. \nAfter Aristides' ostracism, the great general Themistoeles emerged as \nthe city's premier leader. But his many honors and victories went to his \nhead, and he too became arrogant and overbearing, constantly reminding \nthe Athenians of his triumphs in battle, the temples he had built, the dan­\ngers he had fended off. He seemed to be saying that without hirn the city \nwould come to ruin. And so, in 472 B.C., Themistoeles' name was filled in \non the ostraka and the city was rid of his poisonous presence. \nThe greatest political figure in fifth-century Athens was undoubtedly \nPerieles. Although several times threatened with ostracism, he avoided \nthat fate by maintaining elose ties with the people. Perhaps he had leamed \na lesson as a child from his favorite tutor, the incomparable Damon, who TlIE (:()\\\\HII'�ST OF 1'1,:111 \nThe struggle now \nbecame fiercer than \never around the royal \nlitter [of Atahual pa, \nking of the Incan \nempire), It reeled more \nand more, ami at \nlength, several of the \nnobles who supported \nit having been slain, it \nwas overtumed , and \nthe Indian prince \nwould have come with \nviolence to the ground, \nhad not his fall been \nbroken by the efforts of \nPizarro and some other \nof the cavaliers, who \ncaught him in their \narms, The imperial \nborla was instantly \nsnatched from his \ntemples by a soldier, \nand the unhappy \nmonarch, strongly \nsecured, was removed \nto a neighboring build­\ning where he was care­\nfully guarded, \nAll attempt at resis­\ntance now ceased, The \nfate of the Inca \n[Atahual paj so on \nspread over town and \ncountry, The charm \nthat might have held \nthe Peruvians together \nwas dissolved.

PRESCOTT, \n1847 \n360 LAW 42 excelled above all other Athenians in his intelligence, his musical skills, \nand his rhetorical abilities. It was Damon who had trained Pericles in the \narts of ruling. But he, too, suffered ostracism, for his superior airs and his \ninsulting manner toward the commoners stirred up too much resentment. \nToward the end of the century there lived a man named Hyperbolus. \nMost writers of the time describe hirn as the city's most worthless cit izen: \nHe did not care what anyone thought of hirn, and slandered whomever he \ndisliked. He amused some, but irritated many more. In 417 B.C., Hyperbo­\nlus saw an opportunity to stir up anger against the two leading politicians \nof the time, Alcibiades and Nicias. He hoped that one of the two would be \nostracized and that he would rise in that man's place. His campaign \nseemed likely to succeed: The Athenians disliked Alcibiades' flamboyant \nand carefree lifestyle, and were wary of Nicias' wealth and aloofness. \nThey seemed certain to ostracize one or the other. But Alcibiades and \nNicias, aIthough they were otherwise enemies, pooled their resources and \nmanaged to turn the ostracism on Hyperbolus instead. His obnoxious­\nness, they argued, could only be terminated by banishment. \nEarlier sufferers of ostracism had been formidable, powernIl men. \nHyperbolus, however, was a low buffo on, and with his banishment the \nAthenians feit that ostracism had been degraded. And so they ended the \npractice that for nearly a hundred years had been one of the keys to keep­\ning the peace within Athens. \nInterpretation \nThe ancient Athenians had social instincts unknown today-the passage \nof centuries has blunted them. Citizens in the true sense of the word, the \nAthenians sensed the dangers posed by asocial behavior, and saw how \nsuch behavior often disguises itself in other forms: the holier-than-thou at­\ntitude that silently seeks to impose its standards on others; overweening \nambition at the expense of the common good; the flaunting of superiority; \nquiet scheming; terminal obnoxiousness. Some of these behaviors would \neat away at the city's cohesion by creating factions and sowing dissension, \nothers would ruin the democratic spirit by making the common citizen \nfeel inferior and envious. The Athenians did not try to reeducate people \nwho acted in these ways, or to absorb them somehow into the group, or to \nimpose a violent punishment that would only create other problems. The \nsolution was quick and effective: Get rid of them. \nWithin any group, trouble can most often be traced to a single source, \nthe unhappy, chronically dissatisfied one who will always stir up dissen­\nsion and infect the group with his or her ill ease. Before you know what hit \nyou the dissatisfaction spreads. Act before it becomes impossible to disen­\ntangle one strand of misery from another, or to see how the whole thing \nstarted. First, recognize troublemakers by their overbearing presence, or \nby their complaining nature. Once you spot them do not try to reform \nthem or appease them-that will only make things worse. Do not attack \nthem, whether directly or indirectly, for they are poisonous in nature and \nwill work underground to destroy you. Do as the Athenians did: Banish \nthem before it is too late. Separate them from the group before they be­\ncome the eye of a whirlpool. Do not give them time to stir up anxieties \nand sow discontent; do not give them room to move. Let one person suf­\nfer so that the rest can live in peace. \nWhen the tree falls, the monkeys scatter. \nChinese saying \nOBSER VANCE OF THE LAW II \nIn 1296 the cardinals of the Catholic Church met in Rome to select a new \npope. They chose Cardinal Gaetani, for he was incomparably shrewd; \nsuch a man would make the Vatican a great power. Taking the name Boni­\nface VIII, Gaetani so on proved he deserved the cardina ls' high opinion of \nhirn: He plotted his moves carefully in advanc e, and stopped at nothing to \nget his way. Once in power, Boniface quickly crushed his rivals and uni­\nfied the Papal States. The European powers began to fear hirn, and sent \ndelegate s to negotiate with hirn. The German King Albrecht of Austria \neven yielded some territory to Boniface. All was proceeding according to \nthe pope's plan. \nOne piece did not fall into place, however, and that was Tuscany, the \nrichest part of Italy. If Boniface could conquer Florence, Tuscany's most \npowerful city, the region would be his. But Florence was a proud repu blic, \nand would be hard to defeat. The pope had to play his cards skillfully. \nFlorence was divided by two riyal factions, the Blacks and the Whites. \nThe Whites were the merchant families that had recently and quickly \nrisen to power and wealth; the Blacks were the older money. Because of \ntheir popularity with the people, the Whites retained control of the city, to \nthe Blacks' increasing resentment. The feud between the two grew steadily \nmore bitter. \nHere Boniface saw his chance: He would plot to help the Blacks take \nover the city, and Florence would be in his pocket. And as he studied the \nsituation he began to focus on one man, Dante Alighieri, the celebrated \nwriter, poet, and ardent supporter of the Whites. Dante had always been \ninterested in politics. He believed passionately in the republic, and often \nchastised his fellow citizens for their lack of spine. He also happened to be \nthe city's most eloquent public speaker. In 1300, the year Boniface began \nplotting to take over Tuscany, Dante's fellow citizens had voted him in to \nFlorence's highest elected position, making hirn one of the city's six pri­\nors. During his six-month term in the post, he had stood firmly against the \nBlacks and against all of the pope's attempts to sow disorder. \nBy 1301, however, Boniface had a new plan: He called in Charles de \nValois, powerful brother of the king of France, to help bring order to Tus­\ncany. As Charles marched throug h northern Italy, and Florence seethed \nwith anxiety and fear, Dante quickly emerged as the man who could rally THE WOLVES ,\\ \"D \nTHE SHEEP \nOn ce upon a time, the \nwolves sent an embassy \nto the sheep, desiring \nthat there might be \npeace between them for \nthe time to come. \n\"Why, \" said they, \n\"should we be for ever \nwaging this deadly \nstrife? Those wicked \ndogs are the cause of \nall; they are incessantly \nbarking at us, and \nprovoking uso Send \nthem away, and there \nwill be no longer any \nobstacle to our eternal \nfriendship and peace. \" \nThe silly sheep listened, \nthe dogs were \ndismissed, and the \nflock, thus deprived of \ntheir best protector s, \nbecame an easy prey to \ntheir treacherous \nenemy. \nFABLES, \nAESOP, \nSIXTH CENTURY B.C. \nLAW 42 361 \nTlW L1 FF OF \n1'11 F \\1ISTO( ; I ,ES \n[Themistocles :vl fellow \ncitizens reached the \npoint at which their \njealousy made them \nlisten to any slander at \nhis expense, and so \n[hel was forced to \nremind the assembly of \nhis achievements until \nthey could bear this no \nlonger. He once said to \nthose who were \ncomplaining of him: \n\"Why are you tired of \nreceiving beneftts So \noften from the same \nmen?\" Besides this he \ngave offense to the \npeople when he built \nthe temple of Artemis, \nfor not only did he \nstyle the goddess \nArtemis Aristoboule, or \nArtemis wisest in coun­\nsel-with the hint that \nit was he who had \ngiven the best counsel \nto the Athenians and \nthe Creeks-but he \nchose a site for it near \nhis own house at \nMehte .... So at last the \nAthenians banished \nhim. They made use of \nthe ostracism to \nhumble his great repu­\ntation and his author­\nity, as indeed was their \nhabit with any whose \npower they regarded as \noppressive, or who had \nrisen to an eminen ce \nwhich they considered \nout of keeping with (he \nequality of a \ndemocracy. \nTHE L1FE OF \nTHEMIS TOCLES, \nPLUTARCH, \nc. A.D. 46-120 \n362 LAW 42 the people, arguing vehemently against appeasement and working desper­\nately to arm the citizens and to organize resistance against the pope and \nhis puppet French prince. By hook or by crook, Boniface had to neutralize \nDante. And so, even as on the one hand he threatened Florence with \nCharles de Valois, on the other he held out the olive branch, the possibil­\nity of negotiations, hoping Dante would take the bait. And indeed the Flo­\nrentines decided to send adelegation to Rome and try to negotiate a \npeace. To head the mission, predictably, they chose Dante. \nSo me wamed the poet that the wily pope was setting up a trap to lure \nhirn away, but Dante went to Rome anyway, arriving as the French army \nstood before the gates of Florence. He feIt sure that his eloquence and rea­\nson would win the pope over and save the city. Yet when the pope met the \npoet and the Florentine delegates, he instantly intimidated them, as he did \nso many. \"Fall on your knees before me!\" he bellowed at their first meet­\ning. \"Submit to met I tell you that in all truth I have nothing in my heart \nbut to promote your peace.\" Succumbing to his powerful presence, the \nFlorentin es listened as the pope promised to look after their interests. He \nthen advised them to return horne, leaving one of their members behind \nto continue the talks. Boniface signaled that the man to stay was to be \nDante. He spoke with the utmost politeness, but in essence it was an order. \nAnd so Dante remained in Rome. And while he and the pope contin­\nued their dialogue, Florence fell apart. With no one to rally the Whites, \nand with Charles de Valois using the pope's money to bribe and sow dis­\nsension, the Whites disintegrate d, some arguing for negotiations, others \nswitching sides. Facing an enemy now divided and unsure of itself, the \nBlacks easily destroyed them within weeks, exacting violent revenge on \nthem. And once the Blacks stood firmly in power, the pope finally dis­\nmissed Dante from Rome. \nThe Blacks ordered Dante to return horne to face accusations and \nstand trial. When the poet refused, the Blacks condemned hirn to be \nburned to death if he ever set foot in Florence again. And so Dante began \na miserable life of exile, wandering through Italy, disgraced in the city that \nhe loved, never to return to Florence, even after his death. \nInterpretation \nBoniface knew that if he only had apretext to lure Dante away, Florence \nwould crumble. He played the oldest card in the book-threatening with \none hand while holding out the olive branch with the other-and Dante \nfell for it. Once the poet was in Rome, the pope kept hirn there for as long \nas it took. For Boniface understood one of the principal precepts in the \ngame of power: One resolute person, one disobedient spirit, can turn a \nflock of sheep into a den of lions. So he isolated the troublemaker. With­\nout the backbone of the city to keep them together, the sheep quickly \nscattered. \nLeam the lesson: Do not waste your time lashing out in all directions \nat what seems to be a many-headed enemy. Find the one head that mat-\nters-the person with willpower, or smarts, or, most important of all, \ncharisma. Whatever it costs you, lure this person away, for once he is ab­\nsent his powers will lose their effect. His isolation can be physical (banish­\nment or absence from the court), political (narrowing his base of support), \nor psychological (alienating hirn from the group through slander and in­\nsinuation). Cancer begins with a single cell; excise it before it spreads be­\nyond cure. \nKEYS TO POWER \nIn the past, an entire nation would be ruled by a king and his handful of \nministers. Only the elite had any power to play with. Over the centuries, \npower has gradually become more and more diffused and democrat ized. \nThis has created, however, a common misperception that groups no \nlonger have centers of power -that power is spread out and scattered \namong many people. Actually, however, power has changed in its num­\nbers but not in its essence. There may be fewer mighty tyrants command­\ning the power of life and death over millions, but there remain thousands \nof petty tyrants ruling smaller realms, and enforcing their will through in­\ndirect power games, charisma, and so on. In every group, power is con­\ncentrated in the hands of one or two people, for this is one area in which \nhuman nature will never change: People will congregate around a single \nstrong personality like planets orbiting a sun. \nTo labor under the illusion that this kind of power center no longer \nexists is to make endless mistakes, waste energy and time, and never hit \nthe target. Powerful people never waste time. Outwardly they may play \nalong with the game-p retending that power is shared among many-but \ninwardly they keep their eyes on the inevitable few in the group who hold \nthe cards. These are the ones they work on. When troubles arise, they \nlook for the underlying cause, the single strong character who started the \nstirring and whose isolation or banishment will settle the waters again. \nIn his family-therapy practice, Dr. Milton H. Erickson found that if \nthe family dynamic was unsetded and dysfunctional there was inevitably \none person who was the stirrer, the troublemaker. In his sessions he would \nsymbolically isolate this rotten apple by seating hirn or her apart from the \nothers, if only by a few feet. Slowly the other family members would see \nthe physically separate person as the source of their difficulty. Once you \nrecognize who the stirrer is, pointing it out to other people will accomplish \na great deal. Understanding who controls the group dynamic is a critical \nrealization. Remember: Stirrers thrive by hiding in the group, disguising \ntheir actions among the reactions of others. Render their actions visible \nand they lose their power to upset. \nA key element in games of strategy is isolating the enemy's power. In \nchess you try to corner the king. In the Chinese game of go you try to iso­\nlate the enemy's forces in small pockets, rendering them immobile and in­\neffectual. It is often better to isolate your enemies than to destroy \nLAW 42 363 \n364 LAW 42 them-you seem less brutal. The result, though, is the same, for in the \ngame of power, isolation spells death. \nThe most effective form of isolation is somehow to separate your vic­\ntims from their power base. When Mao Tse-tung wanted to eliminate an \nenemy in the ruling elite, he did not confront the person directly ; he \nsilently and stealthily worked to isolate the man, divide his allies and turn \nthem away from hirn, shrink his support. Soon the man would vanish on \nhis own. \nPresence and appearance have great import in the game of power. To \nseduce, particularly in the beginning stages, you need to be constantly \npresent, or create the feeling that you are; if you are often out of sight, the \ncharm will wear off. Queen Elizabeth's prime minister, Robert Cecil, \nhad two main rivals: the queen's favorite, the Earl of Essex, and her for­\nmer favorite, Sir Walter Raleigh. He contrived to send them both on a \nmission against Spain; with them away from the court he managed to \nwrap his tentacles around the queen, seeure his position as her top ad­\nviser and weaken her affection for Raleigh and the earl. The lesson here \nis twofold: First, your absence from the court spells danger for you, and \nyou should never leave the scene in a time of turmoil, for your absence \ncan both symbolize and induce a loss of power; second, and on the other \nhand, luring your enemies away from the court at critical moments is a \ngreat ploy. \nIsolation has other strategie uses. When trying to seduce people, it is \noften wise to isolate them from their usual social context. Once isolated \nthey are vulnerable to you, and your presence becomes magnifi ed. Simi­\nlarly, con artists often look for ways to isolate their marks from their nor­\nmal social milieux, steering them into new environments in which they \nare no longer comforta ble. Here they feel weak, and succumb to decep­\ntion more easily. Isolation, then, can prove a powernd way of bringing \npeople under your spell to seduce or swindle them. \nYou will often find powerful people who have alienated themselves \nfrom the group. Perhaps their power has gone to their heads, and they \nconsider themselves superior; perhaps they have lost the knack of com­\nmunicating with ordinary folk. Remember: This makes them vulnerable. \nPowernd though they be, people like this can be tumed to use. \nThe monk Rasputin gained his power over Czar Nicholas and Czar­\nina Alexandra of Russia through their tremendous isolation from the peo­\npIe. Alexandra in particular was a foreigner, and especially alienated \nfrom everyday Russians; Rasputin used his peasant origins to insinuate \nhirnself into her good graces, for she despera tely wanted to communic ate \nwith her subjects. Once in the court's inner circle, Rasputin made hirnself \nindispensable and attained great power. Heading straight for the center, \nhe aimed for the one figure in Russia who commanded power (the czarina \ndominated her husband) , and found he had no need to isolate her for the \nwork was already done. The Rasputin strategy can bring you great power: \nAlways search out people who hold high positions yet who find them-\nselves isolated on the board. They are like apples falling into your lap, \neasily seduced, and able to catapult you into power yourself. \nFinally, the reason you strike at the shepherd is because such an ac­\ntion will dishearten the sheep beyond any rational measure. When Her­\nnando Cortes and Francisco Pizarro led their tiny forces against the Aztec \nand Incan empires, they did not make the mistake of fighting on several \nfronts, nor were they intimidated by the numbers arrayed against them; \nthey captured the kings, Moctezuma and Atahualpa. Vast empires fell \ninto their hands. With the leader gone the center of gravity is gone; there \nis nothing to revolve around and everything falls apart. Aim at the lead­\ners, bring them down, and look for the endless opportunities in the confu­\nsion that will ensue. \nImage: A Flock of Fatted \nSheep. Do not waste precious \ntime trying to steal a sheep or two; do \nnot risk life and limb by setting upon \nthe dogs that guard the flock. Aim at the \nshepherd. Lure hirn away and the dogs \nwill follow. Strike hirn down and the flock will \nscatter- you can pick them off one by one. \nAuthority : If you draw a bow, draw the \nstrongest. If you use an arrow, use the long­\nest. To shoot arider, first shoot his hor se. \nTo catch a gang of bandits, first capture \nits leader. Just as a country has its \nborder, so the killing of men has its limits. If \nthe enemy's attack can be stopped [with a \nblow to the headJ, why have any more dead \nand wounded than necessary? (Chinese \npoet Tu Fu, Tang dynasty, eighth century) \nLAW 42 365 \n366 LAW 42 REVERSAL \n\"Any harm you do to a man should be done in such a way that you need \nnot fear his reveng e,\" writes Machiavelli. If you act to isolate your enemy, \nmake sure he lacks the me ans to repay the favor. If you apply this Law, in \nother words, apply it from a position of superiority, so that you have noth­\ning to fear from his resentment. \nAndrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln's successor as V.S. president, \nsaw Ulysses S. Grant as a troublesome member of his govemment. So he \nisolated Grant, as aprelude to forcing him out. This only enraged the \ngreat general, however, who responded by forming a support base in the \nRepublican party and going on to become the next president. It would \nhave been far wiser to keep a man like Grant in the fold, where he could \ndo less harm, than to make him revengeful. And so you may often find it \nbetter to keep people on your side, where you can watch them, than to \nrisk creating an angry enemy. Keeping them dose, you can secredy whit­\nde away at their support base, so that when the time comes to cut them \nloose they will fall fast and hard without knowing what hit them. \nLAW \n43 \nWORK ON THE HEARTS \nAND MI ND S OF OTHERS \nJUDGME NT \nCoercion creates a reaetion that will eventually work \nagainst you.

He wrote on a \nroll ofparchment that \nAstyages had \nappointed him to \ncommand the Persian \narmy; then he \nsummoned an assem­\nbly of the Persians, \nopened the roll in their \npresence and read out \nwhat he had written. \n\"And now, he added, \nI have an order for \nyou: every man is to \nappear on parade with \na billhook .... \" \nThe order was obeyed. \nAll the men assembled \nwith their billhooks, \nand Cyrus's next \ncommand was that \nbefore the day was out \nthey should dear a \ncertain piece of rough \nland full of thorn­\nbushes, about eighteen \nor twenty furlongs \nsquare. This too was \ndone, whereupon Cyrus \nissued the further order \nthat they should \npresent themselves \nagain on the following \nday, after having taken \na bath. Meanwh ile, \nCyrus collected and \nslaughtered all his \nfather's goats, sheep, \nand oxen in preparation \nfor entertaining the \nwhole Persian army at \na banquet, together \nwith the best wine and \nbread he could procure. \nThe next day the guests \nassembled, and were \n368 LAW 43 TRAN SGRESSION OF THE LAW \nNear the end of the reign of Louis XV, all of France seemed despera te for \nchange, When the king' s grandson and chosen successor, the future Louis \nXVI, marri ed the fifteen-year-old daughter of the empress of Austria, the \nFrench caught a glimp se of the future that seemed hopeful. The young \nbride, Marie-Antoinette, was beautiful and fuH of life. She instantly \nchanged the mood of the court, which was rank with Louis XV's de­\nbauch eries; even the common people, who had yet to see her, talked excit­\nedly of Marie-Antoinette . The French had grown disgusted with the series \nof mistresses who had dominated Louis XV, and they looked forward to \nserving their new queen. In 1773, when Marie-Antoinette publicly rode \nthrough the streets of Paris for the first time, applauding crowds swarmed \naround her carriage . \"How fortunate ,\" she wrote her mother, \"to be in a \nposition in which one can gain widespread aff ection at so little cost.\" \nIn 1774 Louis XV died and Louis XVI took the throne. As soon as \nMarie-Antoinette became queen she abandoned herself to the pleasures \nshe loved the most--ordering and wearing the most expensive gowns and \njewelry in the realm; sporting the most elaborate hair in history, her \nsculpted coiffures rising as much as three feet above her head; and throwing \na constant succession of masked balls and fe tes. All of these whims she paid \nfor on credit, never concerning herself with the cost or who paid the bills. \nMarie-Antoinette 's greatest pleasure was the creation and designing of \na private Garden of Eden at the Petit Trianon, a chateau on the grounds of \nVersaiHes with its own woods. The gardens at the Petit Trianon were to be \nas \"natural\" as possible, including moss applied by hand to the trees and \nrocks. To heighten the pastoral effect, the queen employed peasant milk­\nmaids to milk the finest-Iooking cows in the realm; launderers and cheese­\nmakers in special peasant outfits she helped design ; shepherds to tend \nsheep with silk ribbons around their necks. When she inspected the barns, \nshe would watch her milkmaids squeezing milk into porcelain vases made \nat the royal ceramic works. To pass the time, Marie-Antoinette would \ngather flowers in the woods around the Petit Trianon, or watch her \"good \npe asants\" doing their \"chores .\" The place became aseparate world, its \ncommunity limited to her chosen favorites. \nWith each new whim, the cost of maintaining the Petit Trianon soared. \nMeanwhile, France itself was deteriorating: There was famine and wide­\nspread discontent. Even socially insulated courtiers seethed with resent­\nment-th e queen treated them like children. Only her favorites mattered, \nand these were becoming fewer and fewer. But Marie-Antoinette did not \nconcern herself with this. Not once throughout her reign did she read a \nminist er's report. Not once did she tour the provin ces and rally the people \nto her side. Not once did she mingle among the Parisians, or receive a del­\negation from them. She did none of these things because as queen she feit \nthe people owed her their affection, and she was not required to love them \nin return. \nIn 1784 the queen became embroiled in a scandal. As part of an elabo­\nrate swindl e, the most expensive diamond necklace in Europe had been \npurchased under her name, ang during the swindlers' trial her lavish \nlifestyle became public: People heard about the money she spent on jewels \nand dresses and masked dances. They gave her the nickname \"Madame \nDeficit,\" and from then on she became the focus of the people's growing \nresentment. When she appeared in her box at the opera the audience \ngreeted her with hisses. Even the court turned against her. For while she \nhad been running up her huge expenditures, the country was headed for \nruin. \nFive years later, in 1789, an unprecedented event took place: the be­\nginning of the French Revolution. The queen did not worry-Iet the peo­\npIe have their little rebellion, she seemed to think; it would soon quiet \ndown and she would be able to resurne her life of pleasure. That year the \npeople marched on Versailles, forcing the royal family to quit the palace \nand take residence in Paris. This was a triumph for the rebels, but it offered \nthe queen an opportunity to heal the wounds she had opened and establish \ncontact with the people. The queen, however, had not learned her lesson: \nNot once would she leave the palace during her stay in Paris. Her subjects \ncould rot in heU for all she cared. \nIn 1792 the royal couple was moved from the palace to a prison, as the \nrevolution officially declared the end of the monarchy. The following year \nLouis XVI was tried, found guilty, and guillotined. As Marie-Antoinette \nawaited the same fate, hardly a soul came to her defense--not one of her \nformer friends in the court, not one of Europe's other monarchs (who, as \nmembers of their own countries' royal farnilies, had all the reason in the \nworld to show that revolution did not pay), not even her own family in \nAustria, including her brother, who now sat on the throne. She had be­\ncome the world's pariah. In October of 1793, she finally knelt at the guillo­\ntine, unrepentant and defiant to the bitter end. \nInterpretation \nFrom early on, Marie-Antoinette acquired the most dangerous of attitudes: \nAs a young princess in Austria she was endlessly flattered and cajoled. As \nthe future queen of the French court she was the center of everyone 's atten­\ntion. She never learned to charm or please other people, to become at­\ntuned to their individual psycholog ies. She never had to work to get her \nway, to use calculation or cunning or the arts of persuasion. And like every­\none who is indulged from an early age, she evolved into a monster of in­\nsensitivity. \nMarie-Antoinette became the focus of an entire country's dissatisfac­\ntion because it is so infuriating to meet with a person who makes no effort \nto seduce you or attempt to persuade you, even if only for the purpose of \ndeception. And do not imagine that she represents a bygone era, or that \nshe is even rare. Her type is today more common than ever. Such types live \nin their own bubble--they seem to feel they are born kings and queens, \nand that attention is owed them. They do not consider anyone else's na­\nture, but bulldoze over people with the self-righteous arrogance of a Marie­\nAntoinette . Pampered and indulged as children, as adults they still believe told to si! down on the \ngrass and enjoy \nthemselves. After the \nmeal Cyrus asked them \nwhich they preferred­\nyesterday 's work or \ntoday's amusement ; \nand they replied that it \nwas indeed a far cry \nfrom the previous day's \nmisery to their present \npleasures. This was the \nans wer which Cyrus \nwanted; he seized upon \nit at once and \nproceeded to lay bare \nwhat he had in mind. \n\"Men of Persia,\" he \nsaid, \"listen to me: obey \nmy orders, and you will \nbe able to enjoy a thou­\nsand pleasures as good \nas this wi!hout ever \nturning your hands to \nmeniallabor; but, if \nyou disobey, yester­\nday's task will be the \npattern of innumerable \nothers you will be \nforced to perform.

Without that base, YOUf power \nwill teeter, and at the slightest change of fortune those below will gladly as­\nsist in YOUf fall from grace. \nOBSER VAN CE OF THE LAW \nIn A.D. 225, Chuko Liang, master strategist and chief minister to the mler \nof Shu in ancient China, confronted a dangerous situa tion. The kingdom of \nWei had mounted an all-out attack on Shu from the north. More dangerous \nstill, Wei had formed an alliance with the barbarous states to the south of \nShu, led by King Meng huo. Chuko Liang had to deal with this second \nmenace from the south before he could hope to fend off Wei in the north. \nAs Chuko Liang prepared to march south against the barbarians, a \nwise man in his camp offered hirn adv ice. It would be impossible, this man \nsaid, to pacify the region by force. Liang would probably beat Menghuo, \nbut as soon as he headed north again to deal with Wei, Menghuo would \nreinva de. \"It is better to win hearts ,\" said the wise man, \"than cit ies; better \nto battle with hearts than with weapons. I hope you will succeed in winning \nthe hearts of these people.\" \"You read my thoug hts,\" responded Chuko \nLiang. \nAs Liang expected, Menghuo launch ed a powernd attack. But Liang \nlaid a trap and managed to capture a large part ofMenghu o's army, includ­\ning the king hirnself. Instead of punishing or executing his prisoners, how­\never, he separated the soldiers from their king, had their shackles removed, \nregaled them with food and wine, and then addressed them. \"You are all \nupright men,\" he said. \"I believe you all have parents, wives, and children \nwaiting for you at horne. They are doubtl ess shedding bitter tears at your \nfate. I am going to release you, so that you can return horne to YOUf loved \nones and comfort them.\" The men thanked Liang with tears in their eyes; \nthen he sent for Mengh uo. \"If I release you,\" asked Liang, \"what will you \ndo?\" \"I will pull my army together again,\" answered the king, \"and lead it \nagainst you to a decisive battle. But if you capture me a second time, I will \nbow to your superiori ty.\" Not only did Liang order Menghuo released, he \ngave hirn a gift of a horse and saddle. When angry lieutenants wondered \nwhy he did this, Liang told them, \"I can capture that man as easily as I can \ntake somet hing out of my pocket. I am trying to win his heart. When I do, \npeace will come of itself here in the south .\" \nAs Menghuo had said he would, he attacked again . But his own offi­\ncers, whom Liang had treated so weIl, rebelIed against hirn, captured hirn, \nand turned hirn over to Liang, who asked hirn again the same question as \nbefore. Menghuo replied that he had not been beaten fairly, but merely be­\ntrayed by his own officers; he would fight aga in, but if captured a third time \nhe would bow to Liang's superio rity. \nOver the following months Liang outwitte d Menghuo again and again, \ncapturing hirn a thir d, a fourth, and a fifth time. On each occasion Meng­\nhuo's troops grew more dissa tisfi ed. Liang had treated them with respect; \nthey had lost their heart for fighting. But every time Chuko Liang asked \nMenghuo to yield, the great king would come up with another excuse: You \ntricked me, 1 lost through bad luck, on and on. If you capture me again, \nhe would promise, 1 swear 1 will not betray you. And so Liang would let \nhim go. \nWhen he captured Menghuo for the sixth time, he asked the king the \nsame question aga in. \"If you capture me a seventh time,\" the king replied, \n\"I shall give you my loyalty and never rebel again .\" \"Very weIl,\" said \nLiang. \"But if I capture you again , 1 will not release you.\" \nNow Menghuo and his soldiers fled to a far corner of their king dom, \nthe region of Wuge . Defeated so many times, Menghuo had only one hope \nleft: He would ask the help of King Wu tugu of Wu ge, who had an immense \nand ferocious army. Wut ugu's warriors wore an armor of tightly woven \nvines soaked in oil, then dried to an impenetrable hard ness. With \nMenghuo at his side, Wu tugu march ed this mighty army aga inst Liang, and \nthis time the great strategist seemed fright ened, leading his men in a hur­\nried retreat. But he was merely leading Wu tugu into a trap : He cornered \nthe king's men in a narrow valley, then lit fires set all around them . When \nthe fires reached the soldiers Wutug u's whole army burst into flame-the \noil in their armor, of course, being highly flamm able. All of them perished. \nLiang had managed to sepa rate Menghuo and his entourage from the \ncarnage in the valley, and the king found hirnself a captive for the seventh \ntime . After this slaughter Liang could not bear to face his prisoner again . \nHe sent a messenger to the captured king: \"He has commissioned me to re­\nlease you. Mobilize another army aga inst hirn, if you can, and try once \nmore to defeat hirn.\" Sobbing, the king fell to the ground, crawled to Liang \non his hands and kne es, and prostrated hirnself at his feet. \"Oh great minis­\nter,\" cried Menghuo, \"yours is the majesty of Heaven. We men of the south \nwill never again offer resistance to your rule.\" \"Do you now yield ?\" asked \nLiang. \"I, my sons, and my grandsons are deeply moved by Your Honor's \nboundl ess, life-giving mercy. How could we not yield?\" \nLiang honored Menghuo with a great banquet, reestablished hirn on \nthe throne, restored his conquered lands to his rule, then returned north \nwith his army, leaving no occupying force. Liang never came back-he had \nno need to: Menghuo had become his most devoted and unshakable ally. \nInterpretation \nChuko Liang had two options: Try to defeat the barbarians in the south \nwith one crushing blow, or patiently and slowly win them to his side over \ntime. Most people more powernIl than their enemy grab the first option \nand never consider the second, but the truly powerful think far ahead : The The men who have \nchanged the universe \nhave never gotten there \nby w(Jrking on leaders, \nbut rather by moving \nthe masses. Working on \nleaders is the method of \nintrigue and only leads \nto secondary results. \nWorking on the masses, \nhowever , is the strake \nof genius that changes \nthe face of the world. \nNAPOLEON BONAP ARTE, \n1769-18 21 \nLlF I·: 0]< \\LE \\.\\� IlI':H \n'1'111': (;HI':.IT \nThis long and painfal \npars/lit of Darius-for \nin eleven days he \nmarched 33 hundred \nfurlongs-harassed his \nsoldiers so that most of \nthem were ready to give \niI up, chiejly for want \nofwater.

A. D. 46- 1 20 \n372 LAW 43 first option may be quick and easy, but over time it brews ugly emotions in \nthe hearts of the vanquished. Their resentment turns to hatred; such ani­\nmosity keeps you on edge-you spend your energy protecting what you \nhave gained, growing paranoid and defensive. The second option, though \nmore difficult, not only brings you peace of mind, it converts a potential \nenemy into a pillar of support. \nIn all your encounters, take a step back-take the time to calculate and \nattune yourself to your targets' emotional makeup and psychological weak­\nnesses. Force will only strengthen their resistance. With most people the \nheart is the key: They are like children, ruled by their emotions. To soften \nthem up, alternate harshn ess with mercy. Play on their basic fears, and also \ntheir loves-f reedom, family, etc. Once you break them down, you will \nhave a lifelong friend and fiercely loyal ally. \nGovernments saw men only in mass; but our men, being irregulars, were not \nformations, but individuals .... Our kingdoms lay in each man 's mind. \nSeven Pillars of Wisdom, T E. Lawrence, 1888-1 935 \nKEYS TO POWER \nIn the game of power, you are surrou nded by people who have absol utely \nno reason to help you unless it is in their interest to do so. And if you have \nnothing to offer their self-interest, you are likely to make them hostile, for \nthey will see in you just one more competitor, one more waster of their \ntime. Those that overcome this prevailing coldness are the ones who find \nthe key that unlocks the stranger's heart and mind, seducing hirn into their \ncorner, if necessary softening hirn up for a punch. But most people never \nleam this side of the game. When they meet someone new, rather than \nstepping back and probing to see what makes this person unique, they talk \nabout them selves, eager to irnpose their own willpower and prejudices. \nThey argu e, boast, and make a show of their power. They may not know it \nbut they are secretly creating an enemy, aresister, because there is no \nmore infuriating feeling than having your individuality igno red, your own \npsychology unac knowledged. It makes you feellifeless and resentful . \nRemember: The key to persuasion is softening people up and break­\ning them down, gently. Seduce them with a two-pronged approach : Work \non their emotions and play on their intellectual weak nesses. Be alert to \nboth what separates them from everyone else (their individual psychol ogy) \nand what they share with everyone else (their basic emotional responses) . \nAim at the primary emotions-Iov e, hate, jealousy. Once you move their \nemotions you have reduced their control, making them more vulnerable to \npersuasion. \nWhen Chuko Liang wanted to dissuade an important general of a rival \nkingdom from entering into an alliance with Ts'ao Ts'ao, Liang's dreade d \nenemy, he did not detail Ts'ao Ts'ao's cruelty, or attack him on moral \ngroun ds. Instead Liang suggested that Ts'ao Ts'ao was really after the gen-\neral's beautiful young wife . This hit the general in the gut, and won hirn \nover. Mao Tse-tung similarly always appealed to popular emotions, and \nspoke in the simplest terms. Educated and well-read hirnse lf, in his \nspeeches he used visceral metaph ors, voicing the pub lic's deepest anxieties \nand enc ouraging them to vent their frustra tions in public meetings. Rather \nthan arguing the practical aspects of a particular program, he would de­\nscribe how it would affect them on the most primitive, down-to-e arth level. \nDo not believe that this approach works only with the illiterate and un­\nschooled-it works on one and all. All of us are mortal and face the same \ndreadful fate, and all of us share the desire for attachm ent and belon ging. \nStir up these emotions and you captivate our hearts. \nThe best way to do this is with a dramatic jolt, of the kind that Chuko \nLiang created when he fed and released prisoners who expected only the \nworst from him. Shaking them to the core, he softened their hearts. Play on \ncontrasts like this: Push people to despair, then give them relief. If they ex­\npect pain and you give them pleasure, you win their hearts. Creating plea­\nsure of any kind, in fact, will usually bring you success, as will allaying fears \nand providing or promising secu rity. \nSymbolic gestures are often enough to win sympathy and goodwill. A \ngesture of self-sacr ifice, for example-a show that you suffer as those \naround you do-will make people identify with you, even if your suffering \nis symbolic or minor and theirs is real. When you enter a group, make a \ngesture of goodwill ; soften the group up for the harsher actions that will fol­\nlow later. \nWhen T. E. Lawr ence was fighting the Turks in the deserts of the Mid­\ndIe East during Wo rld War I, he had an epiphany: It seemed to hirn that \nconventional warfare had lost its value. The old-f ashioned soldier was lost \nin the enormous armies of the time, in which he was ordered about like a \nlifeless pawn. Lawrence wanted to turn this around. For hirn, every sol­\ndier's mind was a kingdom he had to conquer. A committed, psychologi­\ncally motivated soldier would fight harder and more creatively than a \npuppet. \nLaw rence's perception is still more true in the world today, where so \nmany of us feel alienated, anonymous, and suspicious of authority, all of \nwhich makes overt power plays and force even more counterproductive \nand danger ous. Instead of manipulating lifeless pawns, make those on your \nside convinced and excited by the cause you have enlisted them in; this \nwill not only make your work easier but it will also give you more leeway \nto deceive them later on. And to accomplish this you need to deal with \ntheir individual psycholog ies. Never clumsily assurne that the tactic that \nworked on one person will neces sarily work on another. To find the key \nthat will motivate them, first get them to open up. The more they talk, the \nmore they reveal about their likes and dislikes--the handles and levers to \nmove them with. \nThe quickest way to secure people's minds is by demon strating, as \nsimply as possible, how an action will benefit them . Self-interest is the \nLAW 43 373 \n374 LAW 43 strongest motive of all: A great cause may capture minds, but once the first \nflush of excitement is over, interest will flag-u nless there is something to \nbe gained. Self-interest is the solider foundation. The causes that work best \nuse a noble veneer to cover a blatant appeal to self-inter est; the cause se­\nduces but the self -interest secures the deal. \nThe people who are best at appealing to people's minds are often \nartists, intellectuals, and those of a more poetic nature. This is because \nideas are most easily communicated through metaphors and imagery. It is \nalways good policy, then, to have in your pocket at least one artist or intel­\nlectual who can appeal concretely to people's minds. Kings have always \nkept a stable of writers in their bam: Frederick the Great had his Voltaire \n(until they quarreled and separated) , Napoleon won over Goethe. Con­\nversely, Napoleon III's alienation ofwriters such as Victor Hugo, whom he \nexiled from France, contributed to his growing unpopula rity and eventual \ndownfa ll. It is dangerous, then, to alienate those who have powers of ex­\npression, and useful to pacify and exploit them. \nFinally , leam to play the numbers game. The wider your support base \nthe stronger your power. Understanding that one alienated, disaffected \nsoul can spark a blaze of discontent, Louis XIV made sure to endear him­\nself to the lowest members of his staff. You too must constantly win over \nmore allies on allievels-a time will inevitably come when you will need \nthem. \nImage: \nThe Keyhole. \nPeople build \nwalls to keep you \nout; never force \nYOUf way in -you \nwill find only more \nwalls within walls. \nThere are doors in \nthese walls, doors to \nthe heart and mind, and \nthey have tiny key­\nholes. Peer through the \nkeyhole, find the key \nthat opens the dOOf, \nand you have access \nto their will with \nno ugly signs \nof fo rced \ne n t ry. \nAuthority : The difficulties in the way of persuasion lie in my know­\ning the heart of the persuaded in order thereby to fit my wording \ninto it. ... For this reason, whoever attempts persuasi on before \nthe throne, must carefully observe the sovereign's feelings of love \nand hate, his secret wishes and fears, before he can conquer \nhis heart. (Han-fei-tzu, Chinese philosopher, third century B.C.) \nREVERSAL \nThere is no possible revers al to this Law. \nLAW 43 375 \n376 LAW \n44 \nDISAR M AN D INFU RIATE \nWITH THE MIRROR EFF ECT \nJUDGMEN T \nThe mirror rejlects reality, hut it is also the perfect tool for \ndeception: lVhen you mirror your enemies, doing exactly \nas they do, they cannot figure out your strategy. The Mir­\nror Effect mocks and humiliates them, making them over­\nreact. By holding up a mirror to their psyches, you seduce \nthem with the illusion that you share their values; by \nholding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a \nlesson. Few can resist the power of the Mirror Effect. \nMIR RO R EFFECTS: Preliminary Typology \nMirrors have the power to disturb uso Gazing at our reflection in the mir­\nror, we most often see what we want to see-the image of ourselves with \nwhich we are most comforta ble. We tend not to look too closely, ignoring \nthe wrinkles and blemishes. But if we do look hard at the reflected image, \nwe sometimes feel that we are seeing ourselves as others see us, as a person \namong other people, an ob ject rather than a subject. That feeling makes us \nshudder-we see ourselves, but from the outside, minus the thoughts, \nspirit, and soul that fill our consciousne ss. We are a thing. \nIn using Mirror Effects we symbolically re-create this disturbing power \nby mirroring the actions of other people, mimicking their movements to \nunsettle and infuriate them. Made to feel mocked, cloned, objectlike, an \nimage without a soul, they get angry. Or do the same thing slightly differ­\nently and they might feel disarmed-you have perfectly reflected their \nwishes and desires. This is the narcissistic power of mirror s. In either case, \nthe Mirror Effect unsettles your targets, whether angering or entrancing \nthem, and in that instant you have the power to manipulate or seduce \nthem. The Effect contains great power because it operates on the most \nprimitiv e emotio ns. \nThere are four main Mirror Effects in the realm of power: \nThe Neutralizing Effect. In ancient Greek mythology, the Gorgon \nMedusa had serpents for hair, protruding tongue, massive teeth, and a face \nso ugly that anyone who gazed at her was turned into stone, out of fright. \nBut the hero Perseus managed to slay Medusa by polishing his bronze \nshield into a mirror, then using the reflection in the mirror to guide hirn as \nhe crept up and cut off her head without looking at her dire ctly. If the \nshield in this instance was a mirror, the mirror also was a kind of shield: \nMedusa could not see Perseus, she saw only her own reflected actio ns, and \nbehind this screen the hero stole up and destroyed her. \nThis is the essence of the Neutralizing Effect: Do what your enemies \ndo, following their actions as best you can, and they cannot see what you \nare up to-they are blinded by your mirror. Their strategy for dealing with \nyou depends on your reacting to them in a way characteristic of you; neu­\ntralize it by playing a game of mimicry with them . The tactic has a mock­\ning, even infuriating effect. Most of us remember the childhood experience \nof someone teasing us by repeating our words exactly-after a while, usu­\nally not long, we wanted to punch them in the face. Wo rking more subtly \nas an adult, you can still unsettle your opponents this way; shielding your \nown strategy with the mirror, you lay invisible traps, or push your oppo­\nnents into the trap they planned for you. \nThis powerful technique has been used in military strategy since the \ndays of Sun-tzu; in our own time it often appears in political campaigning. \nIt is also useful for disguising those situa tions in which you have no particu­\nlar strategy yourself. This is the Warrior' s Mirror. \nA reverse version of the Neutrali zing Effect is the Shadow: You TlIE MERC II,\\r-,'1 ill\\D \nHIS FHI E'ID \nA certain merchant \nonce had a great desire \nto make a long journey. \nNow in regard that he \nwas not very wealthy, \n\"It is requisite. \" said he \nto hirnself, \"that before \nmy departure I should \nleave some part ofmy \nestate in the city. to the \nend that if I meet with \nililuck in my travel;� \nI may have wherewithal \nto keep me at my \nreturn\" To this purpose \nhe delivered a great \nnumber of bars of iron, \nwhich were a principal \npart of his wealth, in \ntrust to one of his \nfriends, desiring hirn to \nkeep them during his \nabsence; and then, \nta king his leave, away \nhe went. Some time \nafter, having had but ill \nluck in his traveis, he \nreturned horne; and the \nfirst thing he did was to \ngo to his friend, and \ndemand his iron: but \nhis friend, who owed \nseveral sums of money, \nhaving sold the iron to \npay his own debts, \nmade hirn this ans wer,' \n\"Truly, friend,\" said he, \n\"I put your iron into a \nroom that was close \nlocked, imagining it \nwould have been there \nas secure as my own \ngold; but an accident \nhas happened which \nno one could have \nsuspected, for there was \na rat in the room which \nate it all up.\" \nThe merchant , \npretending ignorance, \nreplied, \"It is a terrible \nmisfortune to me \nindeed; but I know of \nLAW 44 377 \nold that rats love iron \nextremely; I have \nsuffered by them many \ntim es before in the same \nmanner, amI therefore \ncan the better bear my \npresent ajfliction.\" \nThis answer extremely \npleased the friend, who \nwas glad to hear the \nmerchant so weil \ninclined to believe that \na rat had eaten his iron; \nand to rem(JVe all \nsuspicions, desired him \nto dine with him the \nnext day. The merchant \npromised he would, but \nin the meantime he met \nin the middle ofthe city \none of his friend's chU-\n(Iren; the child he \ncarried home, and \nlocked up in a room. \nThe next day he went to \nhis friend, who seemed \nto be in greal ajfliction, \nwhich he asked him the \ncause 0[, as if he had \nbeen per fectly ignorant \nofwhat had happened. \n\"0, my dear friend,\" \nanswered the other, \"/ \nbeg you 10 excuse me, if \nyou do not see me so \ncheerful as otherwise \nI would be; I have lost \none of my chi/dren; \nI have had him cried by \nsOl/nd of trumpet, but \nI know not what is \nbecome of him.\" \n\"O!\" replied the \nmerchant, \"/ am grieved \n10 hear this; jär \nyesterday in the \nevening, as I parted \nfrom hence, I saw an \nowl in the air with a \nchild in his claws; bI/I \nwhether it were yours \nI cannot lell.\" \n\"Wh y, you mOSI foolish \nand absurd creature!\" \nreplied the friend, \"are \nYOI/ not aS'hamed 10 lell \nsuch an egregious lie? \nAn owl, thaI weighs at \n378 LAW 44 shadow your opponents' every move without their seeing you. Use the \nShadow to gather information that will neutralize their strategy later on, \nwhen you will be able to thwart their every move. The Shadow is eff ective \nbecause to follow the movements of others is to gain valuab le insights into \ntheir habits and routi nes. The Shadow is the preeminent device for detec­\ntives and spies. \nThe Narcissus Effect. Gazing at an image in the waters of apond, the \nGreek youth Narcissus fell in love with it. And when he found out that the \nimage was his own reflection, and that he therefore could not consummate \nhis love, he despaired and drowned hirnself. All of us have a similar prob­\nlem: We are profoundly in love with ourselves, but since this love excludes \na love object outside ourselves, it remains continuously unsati sfied and un­\nfulfilled. The Narcissus Effect plays on this universal narc issism: You look \ndeep into the souls of other people; fathom their inmost desires, their val­\nues, their tastes, their spirit; and you reflect it back to them, making your­\nself into a kind of mirror image. Your ability to reflect their psyche gives \nyou great power over them; they may even feel a tinge oflove. \nThis is simply the ability to mimic another person not physically, but \npsychologically, and it is immensely powerful because it plays upon the \nunsat isfied self-Iove of a child. Normall y, people bombard us with their ex­\nperiences, their tastes. They hardly ever make the effort to see things \nthrough our eyes. This is annoying, but it also creates great opportunity: If \nyou can show you understand another person by reflecting their inmost \nfeelings, they will be entra nced and disarmed, all the more so because it \nhappens so rarely. No one can resist this feeling of being harmoniously re­\nflected in the outside world, even though you might weH be manufacturing \nit for their benefit, and for deceptive purposes of your own. \nThe Narcissus Effect works wonders in both social life and business; it \ngives us both the Seducer's and the Courti er's Mirror. \nThe Moral Effect. The power of verbal argument is extremely limited, \nand often accomplishes the opposite of what is int ended. As Graciän re­\nmarks, \"The truth is generally seen, rarely heard.\" The Moral Effect is a \nperfect way to demons trate your ideas through actio n. Quite simply, you \nteach others a lesson by giving them a taste of their own medici ne. \nIn the Moral Effect, you mirror what other people have done to you, \nand do so in a way that makes them realize you are doing to them exactly \nwhat they did to you. You make them feeZ that their behavior has been un­\npleasant, as opposed to hearing you complain and whine about it, which \nonly gets their defenses up. And as they feel the result of their actions rnir­\nrored back at them, they realize in the profoundest sense how they hurt or \npunish others with their unsocial beha vior. You objectif y the quali ties you \nwant them to feel ashamed of and create a mirror in which they can gaze at \ntheir follies and leam a lesson about themselve s. This technique is often \nused by educators, psychologists, and anyone who has to deal with un-\npleasant and unconscious behavior. This is the Teacher's Mirror. Whether \nor not there is actually anything wrong with the way people have treated \nyou, however, it can often be to your advantage to reflect it back to them in \na way that makes them feel guilty about it. \nThe Hallucinatory Effect. Mirrors are tremendously deceptive, for they \ncreate a sense that you are looking at the real world. Actually, though, you \nare only staring at a piece of glass, which, as everyone knows, cannot show \nthe world exactly as it is: Everything in a mirror is reversed. When Alice \ngoes through the looking glass in Lewis Carroll 's book, she enters a world \nthat is back-to-front, and more than just visually. \nThe Hallucinatory Effe ct comes from creating a perfect copy of an ob­\nject, a place, aperson. This copy acts as a kind of dummy-p eople take it \nfor the real thing, because it has the physical appearance of the real thing. \nThis is the preeminent technique of con artists, who strategically mimic the \nreal world to deceive you. It also has applications in any arena that re­\nquir es camouflage . This is the Deceiver's Mirror. \nOBSER VA NCES OF MIR RO R EFFEC TS \nObservance I \nIn February of 1815, the emperor Napoleon escaped from the island of \nElba, where he had been imprisoned by the allied forces of Europe, and re­\nturned to Paris in a march that stirred the French nation, rallying troops \nand citizens of all classes to his side and chasing his successor, King Louis \nXVI II, off the thro ne. By March, however, having reestablished hirnself in \npower, he had to face the fact that Fran ce's situation had gravely change d. \nThe country was devastated, he had no allies among the other European \nnations, and his most loyal and important ministers had deserted hirn or \nleft the country. Only one man remained from the old regime- Joseph \nFouche, his former minister of police. \nNapoleon had relied on Fouche to do his dirty work throughout his \nprevious reign, but he had never been able to figure his minister out. He \nkept a corps of agents to spy on all of his ministers, so that he would always \nhave an edge on them, but no one had gotten anything on Fouche. If sus­\npected of some rnisdeed, the minister would not get angry or take the accu­\nsation perso nally-he would submit, nod, srnile, and change colors \ncharneleonlike, adapting to the requirements of the moment. At first this \nhad seemed somewhat pleasant and charming, but after a while it frus­\ntrated Nap oleon, who feit outdone by this slippery man. At one time or an­\nother he had fired all of his most important ministers, including Talleyrand, \nhut he never touched Fouche. And so, in 1815, back in power and in need \nof help, he feit he had no choice but to re appoint Fouche as his minister of \npolic e. \nSeveral weeks into his new reign, Napoleon's spies told him they be-most not above two or \nthree pounds, can he \ncarry a boy that weighs \nabove fi fty? \" \n\"Why,\" replied the \nmerchant, \"do you \nmake such a wonder at \nthat? As if in a country \nwhere one rat can eat a \nhundred tons' weight \no[ iron, it were such a \nwonder for an owl to \ncarry a ehild that \nweighs not overfifty \npounds in aW\" The \nfriend, upon this, found \nthat the mercharll was \nno such fool as he took \nhim to be, begged his \npardon for the cheat \nwhieh he designed to \nhave put upon him, \nrestored him the value \nof his iron, and so had \nhis son again. \nFAHl.ES, \nPILPAY, \nINDlA, \nFOURTH CFNTlJRY \nWhen you have come \nto grips and are striv­\ning together with the \nenemy, and you realize \nthat you cannot \nadvanee, you \"soak in\" \nand become one with \nthe enemy.

Mr aid that his most valuable minister was \nbetraying hirn to his enemies, Nap oleon had to find out the truth before it \nwas too late . He could not confront Fouche direct ly-in person the man \nwas as slippery as an eel. He needed hard proof. \nThis seemed to come in April, when the emperor's private police cap­\ntured a Viennese gentleman who had come to Paris to pass information on \nto Fouc he. Ordering the man brought before hirn, Nap oleon threatened to \nshoot hirn then and there unless he conf essed; the man broke down and \nadmitted he had given Fouche a letter from Metternich, written in invisible \nink, arranging for a secret meeting of special agents in Basel. Nap oleon ac­\ncordingly ordered one of his own agents to infiltrate this meeting. If Fouche \nwas indeed planning to betray hirn, he would finally be caught red-handed \nand would hang. \nNap oleon waited impatiently for the agent's return, but to bis bewil­\nderment the agent showed up days later reporting that he had heard noth­\ning that would implicate Fouche in a conspi racy. In fact it seemed that the \nother agents present suspected Fouche of double-crossing thern, as if he \nwere working for Napoleon all along. Napoleon did not believe this for an \ninstant-F ouche had somehow outwitte d hirn again . \nThe following morning Fouche visited Napoleon, and remarked, \"By \nthe way, sire, I never told you that I had a letter from Metternich a few \ndays ago ; my mind was so full of things of greater moment. Besides, his \nemissary omitted to give me the powder needed to make the writing legi­\nble .... Here at length is the letter. \" Sure that Fouche was toying with hirn, \nNapoleon exploded, \"You are a traito r, Fouc he! I ought to have you \nhange d.\" He continued to harangue Fouche, but could not fire hirn without \nproof. Fouche only expressed amazement at the emperor's words, but in­\nwardly he smiled, for all along he had been playing a mirroring gam e. \nInterpretation \nFouche had known for years that Nap oleon kept on top of tho se around \nhirn by spying on them day and night. The minister had survived this game \nby having his own spies spy on Napoleon's spies, thus neutralizing any ac­\ntion Napoleon might take aga inst hirn. In the case of the meeting in Basel, \nhe even turned the tables: Knowing about Napoleon's double age nt, he set \nit up so that it would appear as if Fouche were a loyal double agent too. \nFouche gained power and flour ished in ap eriod of great tumult by \nmirroring tho se around hirn. During the French Revolution he was a radi­\ncal Jacobin ; after the Terror he became a moderate republican; and under \nNapoleon he became a committed imperialist whom Nap oleon ennobled \nand made the duke of Otranto . If Nap oleon took up the weapon of digging \nup dirt on people, Fouche made sure he had the dirt on Napoleon, as weIl \nas on everyone else. This also allowed hirn to predict the emperor' s plans \nand desires, so that he could echo his boss's sentiments before he had even \nuttered them. Shielding his actions with a mirror strategy, Fouche could \nalso plot offensive moves without being caught in the act. \nThis is the power of mirroring tho se around you. First, you give people \nthe feeling that you share their thoughts and goals. Second, if they suspect \nyou have ulterior motives, the mirror shields you from them, preventing \nthem from figuring out your strategy. Eventually this will infuriate and un­\nsettle them. By playing the double, you steal their thunder, suck away their \ninitiativ e, make them feel helpless. You also gain the ability to choose when \nand how to unsettle them-another avenue to power. And the mirror saves \nyou mental energy: simply echoing the moves of others gives you the \nspace you need to develop a strategy of your own. \nObservance 11 \nEarly on in his career, the ambitious statesman and general Alcibiades of \nAthens (450-404 B.C.) fashioned a formidable weapon that became the \nsource of his power. In every encounter with others, he would sense their \nmoods and tastes, then carefully tailor his words and actions to mirror their \ninmost desires. He would seduce them with the idea that their values were \nsuperior to everyone else's, and that his goal was to model hirnself on them \nor help them realize their dreams. Few could resist his charm. \nThe first man to fall under his speIl was the philosopher Socrates. Al­\ncibiades represented the opposite of the Socratic ideal of simplicity and up­\nrightness: He lived lavishly and was completely unpri ncipled. Whenever \nhe met Socrates, however, he mirrored the older man's sobriety, eating \nsimply, accompanying Socrates on long walks, and talking only of philoso­\nphy and virtue. Socrates was not completely fooled-he was not unaware \nof Alcibiades' other life. But that only made hirn vulnerable to a logic that \nflattered hirn: Only in my presence, he feIt, does this man submit to a virtu­\nous influence; only I have such power over hirn. This feeling intoxicated \nSocrate s, who became Alcibiades' fervent admirer and supporter, one day. \neven risking his own life to rescue the young man in battle. \nThe Athenians considered Alcibiades their greatest orator, for he had \nan uncanny ability to tune in to his audience's aspirations, and mirror their \ndesires. He made his greatest speeches in support of the invasion of Sicily, \nwhich he thought would bring great wealth to Athens and limitless glory to \nhirnself. The speeches gave expression to young Athenians' thirst to con­\nquer lands for themselves, rather than living off the victories of their ances­\ntors. But he also tailored his words to reflect older men's nostalgia for the \nglory years when Athens led the Greeks against Persia, and then went on to \ncreate an empire. All Athens now dreamed of conquering Sicily; Alcibi­\nades' plan was approved, and he was made the expedit ion's commander. \nWhile Alcibiades was leading the invasion of Sicily, however, certain \nAthenians fabricated charges against hirn of profaning sacred statues. He \nknew his enemies would have hirn executed if he retumed horne, so at the \nlast minute he deserted the Athenian fleet and defected to Athens's bitter \nenemy, Sparta. The Spartans welcomed this great man to their side, but \nthey knew his reputation and were wary of hirn. Alcibiades loved luxury; \nthe Spartans were a warrior people who worshipped austerity, and they \nwere afraid he would corrupt their youth. But much to their relief, the AI-heinfi the wronfi \nshape ami size, \nHe had to return to \nhis den \nEmpty·hellied, tai! \ndrafifiinfi, ears \ndrooping, \nAs red in the face as a \nfox who 's been caufiht \nby a hen. \nSELECTEf) FAHLES, \nJEAN DE LA FONT AINF, \n1621-1695 \n'1'111'. 1'1·HI.()I�f:/) \nU:Tn: H \nWhen I wish to find out \nhow wise, or how \nstupid, or how fiood, or \nhow wicked is any one, \nor what are his \nthoufihts at the \nmoment, I fashion the \nexpression of my face, \nas accurately as possi­\nble, in accordance with \nthe expression oI his, \nand then wait to see \nwhat thoufihts or senti­\nments arise in my miml \nor heart, as if to match \nor correspond with the \nexpression. \nEDGAR ALLAN POE, \n1809-1849 \nLAW 44 381 \n1.0KI ·:\\ZO IlE' \\lEI)I(:1 \nSEIH n, TIII ·: POPE \nLorenzo [de' Medici! \nlost no opportunily of \nincreasing the respect \nwhich Pope {nnocent \nnow feit for hirn and of \ngaining his friendship. \nif possible his affection. \nHe took the trouble to \ndiscover the Pope:, \ntastes and indulged \nthern accordingly.

To the Spartans this signified that he \nhad come to see their way of life as superior to the Athenian ; greater than \nthey were, he had chosen to be a Spartan rather than being born one, and \nshould thus be honored above all others. They fell under his speIl and \ngave hirn great powers. Unfortunately Alcibiades rarely knew how to \nrein in his charm-he managed to seduce the king of Sparta's wife and \nmake her pregnant. When this became public he once more had to flee \nfor his life. \nThis time Alcibiades defected to Persia, where he suddenly went from \nSpartan simplicity to embracing the lavish Persian lifestyle down to the last \ndetail. It was of course immensely flattering to the Persians to see a Greek \nof Alcibiades' stature prefer their culture over his own, and they showered \nhirn with honors, land, and power. Once seduced by the mirror, they failed \nto notice that behind this shield Alcibiades was playing a double game, se­\ncretly helping the Athenians in their war with Sparta and thus reingratiat­\ning hirnself with the city to which he desperately wanted to return, and \nwhich welcomed hirn back with open arms in 408 B.C. \nInterpretation \nEarly in his political career, Alcibiades made a discovery that changed his \nwhole approach to power: He had a colorful and forceful personality, but \nwhen he argued his ideas strongly with other people he would win over a \nfew while at the same time alienating many more. The secret to gaining as­\ncendancy over large numbers, he came to believe, was not to impose his \ncolors but to absorb the colors of those around hirn, like a chameleon. \nOnce people fell for the trick, the deceptions he went on to practice would \nbe invisible to them. \nUndersta nd: Everyone is wrapped up in their own narcissistic shell. \nWhen you try to impose your own ego on them, a wall goes up, resistance \nis increased. By mirroring them, however, you seduce them into a kind of \nnarcissistic rapture: They are gazing at a double of their own soul. This \ndouble is actually manufactured in its entirety by you. Once you have used \nthe mirror to seduce them, you have great power over them. \nIt is worth noting, however, the dangers in the promiscuous use of the \nmirror. In Alcibiades' presence people feIt larger, as if their egos had been \ndoubled. But once he left, they feIt empty and diminish ed, and when they \nsaw hirn mirroring completely different people as totally as he had mir­\nrored them, they feIt not just diminished but betrayed. Alcibiades' overuse \nof the Mirror Effect made whole peoples feel used, so that he constantly \nhad to flee from one place to another. Indeed Alcibiades so angered the \nSpartans that they finally had hirn murdered. He had gone too far. The Se­\nducer's Mirror must be used with caution and discrimina tion. \nObservance 111 \nIn 1652 the recently widowed Baroness Mancini moved her family frorn \nRome to Paris, where she could count on the influence and protection of \nher brother Cardinal Mazarin, the French prime minister. Of the \nbaroness's five daug hters, four dazzled the court with their beauty and high \nspirits. These infam ously charming nieces of Cardinal Mazarin became \nknown as the Mazarinette s, and soon found themselves invited to all the \nmost important court functions . \nOne daughter, Marie Mancini, did not share this good fortune, for she \nlacked the beauty and grace of her sisters-who, along with her mother \nand even Cardinal Mazarin, eventually came to dislike her, for they feit \nshe spoiled the family image . They tried to persuade her to enter a con­\nvent, where she would be less of an embarrassment, but she refused. In­\nstead she applied herself to her studies, learning Latin and Greek, \nperfecting her French, and practicing her musical skills. On the rare occa­\nsions when the family would let her attend court affairs, she trained herself \nto be an artful listen er, sizing people up for their weaknesses and hidden \ndesires. And when she finally met the future King Louis XIV, in 1657 \n(Louis was seventeen years old, Marie eighteen) , she decided that to spite \nher family and unde, she would find a way to make this young man fall in \nlove with her. \nThis was a seemingly impossible task for such a plain-Iooking girl, but \nMarie studied the future king dosely. She noticed that her sisters' frivolity \ndid not please hirn, and she sensed that he loathed the scheming and petty \npoliticking that went on all around hirn. She saw that he had a romantic na­\nture-he read adventure novels, insisted on marching at the head of his \narmies, and had high ideals and a passion for glory. The court did not feed \nthese fanta sies of his; it was a banal, superficial world that bored hirn. \nThe key to Louis 's heart, Marie saw, would be to construct a mirror re­\nflecting his fantasies and his youthful yearnings for glory and roma nce. To \nbegin with she immersed herself in the romantic novels, poems, and plays \nthat she knew the young king read voraciously. When Louis began to en­\ngage her in conversation, to his delight she would talk of the things that \nstirred his soul-not this fashion or that piece of gossip, but rather courtly \nlove, the deeds of great knights, the nobility of past kings and heroes. She \nfed his thirst for glory by creating an image of an august, superior king \nwhom he could aspire to become. She stirred his imaginati on. \nAs the future Sun King spent more and more time in Marie 's presence, \nit eventually became dear that he had fallen in love with the least likely \nyoung woman of the court. To the horror of her sisters and mother, he \nshowered Marie Mancini with attention. He brought her along on his mili­\ntary campaigns, and made a show of stationing her where she could watch \nas he marched into battle . He even promised Marie that he would marry \nher and make her queen. \nMazarin, however, would never allow the king to marry his niece, a \nwoman who could bring France no diplomatie or royal alliances. Louis had \nto marry a princess of Spain or Austria. In 1658 Louis succumbed to the \npressure and agreed to break off the first romantic involvement of his life. \nHe did so with much regret, and at the end of his life he acknowl edged that \nhe never loved anyone as much as Marie Mancini. Wittgenstein had an \nextraordinary gift for \ndivining the thoughts \nof the person with \nwhom he was engaged \nin discussion. Whi/e the \nother strugg/ed to put \nhis thought into words, \nWittgenstein wou/d \nperceive what it was \nand state it for him. \nThis power ofhis, \nwhich sometimes \n.\\'cerned uncanny, was \nmade possible, I am \nsure, by his own \npr%nged and continu­\nous researches. \nLUDWIG WITTGENSTEIN: \nA MEMOIR, \nNORMA N MALCOLM, \n1958 \nThe doctor shou/d be \nopaque to his patient'·, \nand like a mirror, \nshou/d show them \nnothing but wh at is \nshown to him. \nSIGMllND FREIJl), \n1856-1 939 \nLAW 44 383 \n384 LAW 44 Interpretat ion \nMarie Mancini played the seducer's game to perf ection. First, she took a \nstep back, to study her prey. Seduction often fails to get past the first step \nbecause it is too aggre ssive; the first move must always be a retreat. By \nstudying the king from a distance Marie saw what distingui shed hirn from \nothers-his high ideals, romantic nature, and snobbish disdain for petty \npolitics. Marie's next step was to make a mirror for these hidden yearnings \non Louis's part, letting hirn glimpse what he hirnself could be-a godlike \nking! \nThis mirror had several functions: Satisfying Louis's ego by giving hirn \na double to look at, it also focused on hirn so exdusively as to give him the \nfeeling that Marie existed for hirn alone. Surro unded by a pack of schem­\ning courtiers who only had their own self-int erest at heart, he could not fall \nto be touched by this devotional focus. Finally Mar ie's mirror set up an \nideal for hirn to live up to: the noble knight of the medieval court. To a soul \nboth romantic and ambitious, nothing could be more intoxicating than to \nhave someone hold up an idealized reflection of hirn. In effect it was Marie \nMancini who created the image of the Sun King- indeed Louis later ad­\nmitted the enormous part she had played in fash ioning his radiant self­\nimage. \nThis is the power of the Seducer's Mirror: By doubling the tastes and \nideals of the target, it shows your atte ntion to his or her psychology, an at­\ntention more charming than any aggr essive pursuit. Find out what sets the \nother person apart, then hold up the mirror that will reflect it and bring it \nout of them. Feed their fantasi es of power and greatn ess by reflecting their \nideals, and they will succu mb. \nObser vance IV \nIn 1538, with the dea th of his mother, Helena, the eight- year-old future \nczar Ivan IV (or Ivan the Terribl e) of Russia became an orphan. For the \nnext five years he watched as the princely dass, the boyars, terroriz ed the \ncountry. Now and then, to mock the young Ivan, they would make him \nwear a crown and scepter and place hirn on the thro ne. When the little \nboy's feet dangl ed over the edge of the chair, they would laugh and lift him \noff it, handing hirn from man to man in the air, making hirn feel his help­\nlessness compared to them . \nWhen Ivan was thirte en, he boldly murdered the boyar leader and as­\ncended to the thro ne. For the next few decades he struggl ed to subdue the \nboyars' power, but they continued to defy hirn. By 1575 his efforts to trans­\nform Russia and defeat its enemies had exhau sted hirn. Meanwhile, his \nsubjects were comp laining bitterly about his endless wars, his secret police, \nthe unvanqui shed and oppressive boyars. His own ministers began to ques­\ntion his moves. Finally he had had enough. In 1564 he had tempo rarily \naba ndoned the throne, forcing his subjects to call hirn back to power. Now \nhe took the strategy a step further, and abdicate d. \nTo take his place Ivan elevated a general of his, Simeon Bekbulatovich, \nto the throne. But although Simeon had recently converted to Christianity, \nhe was by birth a Tartar, and his enthronement was an insult to Ivan's sub­\njects, since Russians looked down on the Tartars as inferiors and infidels. \nYet Ivan ordered that all Russians, including the boyars, pledge obedience \nto their new ruler. And while Simeon moved into the Kremlin, Ivan lived \nin a humble house on Moscow's outskirts, from which he would sometimes \nvisit the palace, bow before the throne, sit among the other boyars, and \nhumbly petition Simeon for favors. \nOver time it became clear that Simeon was a kind ofking's double . He \ndressed like Ivan, and acted like Ivan, but he had no real power, since no \none would really obey hirn. The boyars at the court who were old enough \nto remember taunting Ivan when he was a boy, by placing hirn on the \nthrone, saw the connection: They had made Ivan feel like a weak pre­\ntender, so now he mirrored them by placing a weak pretender of his own \non the throne. \nFor two long years Ivan held the mirror of Simeon up to the Russian \npeople. The mirror said: Your whining and disobedience have made me a \nczar with no real power, so I will reflect back to you a czar with no real \npower. You have treated me disrespectfully, so I will do the same to you, \nmaking Russia the laughingstock of the world. In 1577, in the name of the \nRussian people, the chastised boyars once again begged Ivan to return to \nthe throne, which he did. He lived as czar until his death, in 1584, and the \neonspirac ies, complaining, and second-guessing disappeare d along with \nSimeon. \nInterpretation \nIn 1564, after threatening to abdicate, Ivan had been granted absolute pow­\ners. But these powers had slowly been chipped away as every sector of so­\neiety-the boyars, the church, the government-vied for more control. \nForeign wars had exhausted the country, internal bickering had increased, \nand Ivan's attempts to respond had been met with scorn. Russia had turned \ninto a kind of boisterous classroom in which the pupils laughed openly at \nthe teaeher. If he raised his voice or complained, he only met more resis­\ntance. He had to te ach them a lesson, give them a taste of their own medi­\neine. Simeon Bekbulatovich was the mirror he used to do so. \nAfter two years in which the throne had been an object of ridicule and \ndisgust, the Russian people leamed their lesson. They wanted their czar \nback, conceding to hirn all the dignity and respect that the position should \nalways have commanded. For the rest of his reign, Russia and Ivan got \nalong fine. \nUnderstand : People are locked in their own experiences. When you \nwhine about some insensi tivity on their part, they may seem to understand, \nbut inwardly they are untouched and even more resistant. The goal of \npower is always to lower people's resistance to you. For this you need \ntricks, and one trick is to teach them a lesson. \nInstead of haranguing people verbally, then, create a kind of mirror of \ntheir behavior. In doing so you leave them two choices: They can ignore \nLAW 44 385 \n386 LAW 44 you, or they can start to think about thems elves. And even if they ignore \nyou, you will have planted a seed in their unconscious that will eventually \ntake root. When you mirror their behavior, incidentally, do not be afraid to \nadd a touch of caricature and exaggerati on, as Ivan did by enthroning a \nTartar-it is the little spiee in the soup that will open their eyes and make \nthem see the ridiculousness in their own act ions. \nObservance V \nDr. Milton H. Erickson, a pioneer in strategie psychotherapy, would often \neducate his patients powerfully but indirectly by creating a kind of mirror \neffect. Constructing an analogy to make patients see the truth on their own, \nhe would bypass their resistance to change . When Dr. Erickson treated \nmarri ed couples complaining of sexual problems, for insta nce, he often \nfound that psychotherapy's tradition of direct confrontation and probIern­\nairing only heightened the spouses' resistance and sharpened their differ­\nences. Instead, he would draw a husband and wife out on other topics, \noften banal ones, trying to find an analogy for the sexual confli ct. \nIn one couple's first session, the pair were discussing their eating \nhabits , especia lly at dinner. The wife preferred the leisurely approach-a \ndrink before the meal, some appetizers, and then a small main course, all at \na slow, civilized pace. This frustrated the husband -he wanted to get din­\nner over quickly and to dig right into the main course, the bigger the better. \nAs the conversation contin ued, the couple began to catch glimp ses of an \nanalogy to their problems in bed. The moment they made this connection, \nhowever, Dr. Erickson would change the subject, carefully avoiding a dis­\ncussion of the real problem. \nThe couple thought Erickson was just getting to know them and would \ndeal with the problem directly the next time he saw them. But at the end of \nthis first session, Dr. 'Erickson directed them to arrange a dinner a few \nnights away that would combine each person's desire: The wife would get \nthe slow meal, including time spent bon ding, and the husband would get \nthe big dishes he wanted to eat. Without realizing they were acting under \nthe doctor's gentle guidance, the couple would walk into a mirror of their \nproblem, and in the mirror they would solve their problems themselves, \nending the evening just as the doctor had hoped-by mirroring the im­\nproved dinner dyna mies in bed. \nIn dealing with more severe problems, such as the schizophrenie's \nmirror fantasy world of his or her own construction, Dr. Erickson would al­\nways try to enter the mirror and work within it. He once treated a hos pital \ninmate who believed he was Jesus Christ-draping sheets around his \nbody, talking in vague para bles, and bombarding staff and patients with \nendless Christian proselytizing. No therapy or drugs seemed to work, until \none day Dr. Erickson went up to the young man and said, \"I unde rstand \nyou have had experience as a carpenter. \" Being Christ, the patient had to \nsay that he had had such experience, and Erickson immediately put hirn to \nwork building bookcases and other useful items, allowing hirn to wear his \nJesus garb. Over the next weeks, as the patient worked on these projects, \nhis mind became less occupied with Jesus fantasies and more focused on \nhis labor. As the carpentry work took precedence, a psychic shift took ef­\nfeet: The religio us fantasies remain ed, but faded comf ortably into the back­\nground, allowing the man to function in society. \nInterpretation \nCommunication depends on metaphors and symbols, which are the basis \nof language itself. A metaphor is a kind of mirror to the concrete and real, \nwhich it often expre sses more clearly and deeply than a literal description \ndoes. When you are dealing with the intractable willpower of other people, \ndirect communication often only heightens their resista nce. \nThis happens most clearly when you complain about people's behav­\nior, particularly in sensitive areas such as their lovemaking. You will effect \na far more lasting change if, like Dr. Erickson, you construct an analogy, a \nsymb olic mirror of the situation, and guide the other through it. As Christ \nhirnself underst ood, talking in parables is often the best way to teach a les­\nson, for it allows people to realize the truth on their OWll. \nWhen dealing with people who are lost in the reflections of fantasy \nworlds (including a host of people who do not live in mental hospital s), \nnever try to push them into reality by shattering their mirrors. Instead, \nenter their world and operate inside it, under their rules, gently guiding \nthem out of the hall of mirrors they have enter ed. \nObs erva nce VI \nThe great sixteenth-century Japanese tea master Tak eno Sho-o once \npassed by a house and noticed a young man watering flowers near his front \ngate. Two things caught Sho-o's attention-first, the graceful way the man \nperformed his task; and, second, the stunningly beautiful rose of Sharon \nblossoms that bloomed in the gard en. He stopped and introduced hirnself \nto the man, whose name was Sen no Rikyu. Sho-o wanted to stay, but he \nhad a prior engagement and had to hurry off. Before he left, however, \nRikyu invited hirn to take tea with him the following morning. Sho-o hap­\npily accept ed. \nWhen Sho-o opened the garden gate the next day, he was horrified to \nsee that not a single flower remained. More than anything else, he had \ncome to see the rose of Sharon blossoms that he had not had the time to ap­\npreciate the day befo re; now, disappointed, he started to leave, but at the \ngate he stopped hirnself , and decided to enter Sen no Rik yu's tea room. Im­\nmediately insi de, he stopped in his tracks and gazed in astonishmen t: Be­\nfore hirn a vase hung from the ceiling, and in the vase stood a single rose of \nSharon blossom, the most beautiful in the gard en. Somehow Sen no Rikyu \nhad read his guest' s thoug hts, and , with this one eloquent gesture, had \ndemonstrated that this day guest and host would be in perfect harmony. \nSen no Rikyu went on to become the most fam ous tea master of all, \nand his trademark was this uncanny ability to harmonize hirnself with his \nguests' thoughts and to think one step ahe ad, enchanting them by adapting \nto their taste. \nOne day Rikyu was invited to tea by Yamashina Hechigwan, an ad-\nLAW 44 387 \n388 LAW 44 mirer of the tea ceremony but also a man with a vivid sense of humor. \nWhen Rikyu arrived at Hechigwan 's horne, he found the garden gate shut, \nso he opened it to look for the host. On the other side of the gate he saw \nthat someone had first dug a ditch, then carefully covered it over with can­\nvas and earth. Realizing that Hechigwan had planned a practical joke, he \nobligingly walked right into the ditch, muddying his clothes in the process. \nApparently horrified, Hechigwan came running out, and hurried \nRikyu to a bath that for some inexplicable reason stood already prepared. \nAfter bathing, Rikyu joined Hechigwan in the tea ceremony, which both \nenjoyed immensely, sharing a laugh about the accident. Later Sen no \nRikyu explained to a friend that he had heard about Hechigwan 's practical \njoke beforehand, \"But since it should always be one's aim to conform to \nthe wishes of one's host, I fell into the hole knowingly and thus assured the \nsuccess of the meeting. Tea is by no means mere obsequious ness, but there \nis no tea where the host and guest are not in harmony with one another. \" \nHechigwan 's vision of the dignified Sen no Rikyu at the bottom of a ditch \nhad pleased him endlessly, but Rikyu had gained a pleasure of his own \nin complying with his host's wish and watching him amuse hirnself in \nthis way. \nInterpretation \nSen no Rikyu was no magician or seer-he watched those around hirn \nacutely, plumbing the subtle gestures that revealed a hidden desire, then \nproducing that desire's image. Although Sho-o never spoke of being en­\nchanted by the rose of Sharon blossoms, Rikyu read it in his eyes. If mir­\nroring a person's desires meant falling into a ditch, so be it. Rikyu's power \nresided in his skillful use of the Cour tier's Mirror, which gave hirn the ap­\npearance of an unusual ability to see into other people. \nLearn to manipulate the Courtier's MirrOf, for it will bring you great \npower. Study people's eyes, follow their gestures-surer barometers of pain \nand pleasure than any spoken word. Notice and remember the details- the \nclothing, the choice of friends, the daily habits, the tossed-out remarks­\nthat reveal hidden and rarely indulged desires. Soak it all in, find out what \nlies under the surface, then make yourself the mirror of their unspoken \nselves. That is the key to this power: The other person has not asked for \nyour consideration, has not mentioned his pleasure in the rose of Sharon, \nand when you reflect it back to hirn his pleasure is heightened because it is \nunasked for. Rememb er: The wordless communication, the indirect com­\npliment, contains the most power. No one can resist the enchantment of the \nCourtier's Mirror. \nObservance VII \nYellow Kid Weil, con artist extraordinaire, used the Deceiver's Mirror in \nhis most brilliant cons. Most audacious of all was his re-creation of a bank \nin Muncie, Indiana. When Weil read one day that the Merchants Bank in \nMuncie had moved, he saw an opportunity he could not pass up. \nWeil rented out the original Merchants building, which still contained \nbank furniture, complete with teller windows. He bought money bags, \nstenciled a bank's invented name on them, filled them with steel washers, \nand arrayed them impressively behind the teller windows, along with bun­\ndIes of boodle-real bills hiding newspaper cut to size. For his bank's staff \nand customers Weil hired gambIers, bookies, girls from local bawdy \nhouses, and other assorted confederates. He even had a local thug pose as a \nbank dick. \nClaiming to be the broker for a certificate investment the bank was of­\nfering, Weil would fish the waters and hook the proper wealthy sucker. He \nwould bring this man to the bank and ask to see the president. An \"officer\" \nof the bank would tell them that they had to wait, which only heightened \nthe realism of the con-one always has to wait to see the bank president. \nAnd as they waited the bank would bustle with banklike activity, as call \ngirls and bookies in disguise floated in and out, making deposits and with­\ndrawals and tipping their hats to the phony bank dick. Lulled by this per­\nfeet copy of reality, the sucker would deposit $50,000 into the fake bank \nwithout a worry in the world. \nOver the years Weil did the same thing with adeserted yacht club, an \nabandoned brokerage office, a relocated real estate office, and a com­\npletely realistic gambling club. \nInterpretation \nThe mirroring of reality offers immense deceptive powers. The right uni­\nform, the perfect accent, the proper props--the deception cannot be deci­\nphered because it is enmeshed in a simulation of reality. People have an \nintense desire and need to believe, and their first instinct is to trust a well­\nconstrueted facade, to mistake it for reality. After all, we cannot go around \ndoubting the reality of everything we see-that would be too exhausting. \nWe habitually accept appearances, and this is a credulity you can use. \nIn this particular game it is the first moment that counts the most. If \nYOUf suckers' suspicions are not raised by their first glance at the mirror's \nreflection, they will stay suppressed. Once they enter your hall of mirrors, \nthey will be unable to distinguish the real from the fake, and it will become \neasier and easier to deceive them. Remember: Study the world's surfaces \nand leam to mirror them in your habits, your manner, YOUf clothes. Like a \ncamivorous plant, to unsuspecting insects you will look like all the other \nplants in the field. \nAuthority : The task of a military operation is to accord decep­\ntively with the intentions of the enemy ... get to what they want \nfirst, subtly anticipate them. Maintain discipline and adapt to \nthe enemy .... Thus, at first you are like a maiden, so the enemy \nopens his door; then you are like a rabbit on the loose, so \nthe enemy cannot keep you out.

Ludwig was Wagner's biggest fan and most generous patron. The \nstrength of his support tumed Wagner's head-once established in Munich \nunder the king's protection, he would be able to say and do whatever he \nwanted. \nWagner moved into a lavish house, which the king eventually bought \nfor hirn. This house was but a stone's throw from the former horne of Lola \nMontez, the notorious courtesan who had plunged Ludwig lI's grandfather \ninto a crisis that had forced hirn to abdicate . Wamed that he could be in­\nfected by this association, Wagner only scoffed-\"I am no Lola Montez,\" \nhe said. So on enough, however, the citizens of Munich began to resent the \nfavors and money showered on Wagner, and dubbed hirn \"the second \nLola,\" or \"Lolotte .\" He unconsciously began to tread in Lola's footsteps­\nspending money extravagantly, meddling in matters beyond music, even \ndabbling in politics and advising the king on cabinet appoint ments. Mean­\nwhile Ludwig's affection for Wagner seemed intense and undignified for a \nking-just like his grandfath er's love for Lola Montez. \nEventually Ludwig' s ministers wrote bim a letter: \"Y our Majesty now \nstands at a fateful parting of the ways: you have to choose between the love \nand respect of your faithful people and the 'friendship' of Richard Wag­\nner. \" In December of 1865, Ludwig politely asked bis friend to leave and \nnever return. Wagner had inadvertently placed himself in Lola Monte z's \nreflection. Once there, ever ything he did reminded the stolid Bavarians of \nthat dread woman, and there was nothing he could do ab out it. \nAvoid such association- effects like the plague .

Too much innovation is traumatic, and will lead \nto revolt. If you are new to a position of power, or an out­\nsider trying to build a power base, make a show of ni­\nspecting the old way of doing things. If change is \nnecessary, make it feel like a gentle improvemen t on the \npast. \nTRAN SGR ESSION OF THE LAW \nSometime in the early 1520s, King Henry VIII of England decided to di­\nvorce his wife , Catherine of Arago n, because she had failed to bear hirn a \nson, and because he had fallen in love with the young and comely Anne \nBoleyn. The pope, Clement VII, opposed the divorce, and threate ned the \nking with excommunica tion. The king's most powerful minister, Cardinal \nWolsey, also saw no need for divorce--and his halfhearted support of the \nking cost hirn his position and soon his life. \nOne man in Henry's cabinet, Thomas CromwelI, not only supported \nhim in his desire for a divorce but had an idea for realizing it: a complete \nbreak with the past. He convin ced the king that by severing ties with Rome \nand making hirnself the head of a newly formed English church, he could \ndivorce Catherine and marry Anne . By 1531 Henry saw this as the only so­\nlutio n. To reward Cromwell for his simple but brilliant idea, he elevated \nthis son of a blacksmith to the post of royal councillor. \nBy 1534 Cromwell had been named the king's secretary, and as the \npower behind the throne he had become the most powerful man in Eng­\nland. But for hirn the break with Rome went beyond' the satisf action of the \nking' s carnal desire s: He envisioned a new Protestant order in England, \nwith the power of the Catholic Church smashed and its vast wealth in the \nhands of the king and the govemment. In that same year he initiated a \ncomplete survey of the church es and monasteries of England. And as it \nturned out, the treasures and moneys that the churches had accumulated \nover the centuries were far more than he had imagin ed; his spies and \nagents came back with astonishing figu res. \nTo justify his schemes, Cromwell circulated stories about the corrup­\ntion in the English monasterie s, their abuse of power, their exploitation of \nthe people they supposedly served. Having won Parliament's support for \nbreaking up the monasteries, he began to seize their holdings and to put \nthem out of existence one by one. At the same time, he began to impose \nProtestantism, introducing reforms in religious ritual and punishing tho se \nwho stuck to Cath olicism, and who now were called heretic s. Virtually \novernight, England was converted to a new official relig ion. \nA terror fell on the country. Some people had suff ered under the \nCatholic Church, which before the reforms had been immensely powerful, \nbut most Britons had strong ties to Catholi cism and to its comforting ritu­\nals. They watched in horror as churches were demolished, images of the \nMadonna and saints were broken in pieces, stained-glass windows were \nsmashed, and the churc hes' treasures were confiscate d. With monasteries \nthat had succored the poor suddenly gone, the poor now flooded the \nstreets. The growing ranks of the beggar dass were further swelled by for­\nmer monks. On top of all this, CromwelI levied high taxes to pay for his ec­\nclesiastical reforms. \nIn 1535 powerful revolts in the North of England threatened to toppie \nHenry from his throne. By the following year he had suppressed the rebel­\nHons, but he had also begun to see the costs of Crom well's reforms. The \nking hirnself had never wanted to go this far-he had only wanted a di-WIIEHE CHH ISTMAS \nCAME FHOM \nCelebrating the turn of \nthe year is an ancient \ncustom. The Romans \ncelebrated the Saturna­\nlia, the festival of \nSaturn, god of the \nharvest, between \nDecember 17 and 23. It \nwas the most cheerful \nfestival of the year. All \nwork and commer ce \nstopped, and the streets \nwere filled with crowds \nand a carnival atmos­\nphere. Slaves were \ntemporarily freed, and \nthe houses were deco­\nrated with laurel \nbranches. People \nvisited one another, \nbringing gifts ofwax \ncandles and little clay \nfigurines. \nLong before the birth \nof Christ, the lews cele­\nbrated an eight-day \nFestival of Lights [at \nthe same season}, and it \nis believed that the \nGermanie peoples held \na great festival not only \nat midsummer but also \nat the winter solstice, \nwhen they celebrated \nthe rebirth of the sun \nand honored the great \nfertility gods Wotan \nand Freyja, Donar \n(Thor) and Freyr. Even \nafter the Emperor \nConstantine (A.D. \n306-337) declared \nChristianity to be \nRome's official impe­\nrial religion, the evoca­\ntion of light and \nfertility as an important \ncomponent of pre­\nChristian midwinter \ncelebrations could not \nbe entirely suppressed. \nIn the year 274 the \nRoman Emperor Aure­\nlian (A.D. 214-275) had \nestablished an official \nLAW 45 393 \nmit of the sun-god \nMithras, declaring his \nbirthday, December 25, \nanational holiday. The \ncult of Mithras, the \nA ryan god of light, had \nspread from Persia \nthrough Asia Minor (0 \nGreece, Rome, and as \nfar as the Germanie \nlands and Britain. \nNumerous ruins ofhis \nshrines still testify to \nthe high regard in \nwhich this god was \nheld, especially by the \nRoman legions, as a \nbringer of fertility, \npeace, and victory. \nSo it was a clever move \nwhen, in the year A.D. \n354, the Christian \nchurch under Pope \nLiberius (352-366) co­\nopted the birthday of \nMithras and declared \nDecember 25 to be \nthe birthday \nof Jesus Christ. \nNEIJE ZIJRCIIER \nZEITUNG, \nANNE-SUSANNE \nRISCHKE, \nDECEM HER 25, 1983 \n394 LAW 45 vorce. It was now Cromwe ll's turn to watch uneasily as the king began \nslowly to undo his reforms, reinstating Catholic sacraments and other ritu­\nals that Cromwell had outlawed. \nSensing his fall from grace, in 1540 Cromwell decided to regain \nHenry's favor with one throw of the dice: He would find the king a new \nwife. Henry' s third wife, lane Seymour, had died a few years before, and \nhe had been pining for a new young queen. It was Cromwell who found \nhirn one: Anne of Cleves, a German princ ess and, most important to \nCromwell, a Protestant. On Cromwe ll's commission, the painter Holbein \nproduced a flattering portrait of Anne; when Henry saw it, he fell in love, \nand agreed to marry her. Cromwell seemed back in favor. \nUnfortunate ly, however, Holbein's painting was highly idealized, and \nwhen the king finally met the princess she did not please hirn in the least. \nHis anger against Cromwell-first for the ill-conceived reforms, now for \nsaddling hirn with an unattractiv e and Protestant wife-could no longer be \ncontained. In lune of that year, Cromwell was arrested, charged as a Protes­\ntant extremist and a heretic, and sent to the Tower. Six weeks later, before a \nlarge and enthusiastic crowd, the public executioner cut off his head. \nInterpretation \nThomas Cromwell had a simple idea: He would break up the power and \nwealth of the Church and lay the foundation for Protestantism in England. \nAnd he would do this in a mercilessly short time. He knew his speedy re­\nforms would cause pain and resentment, but he thought these feelings \nwould fade in a few years. More important, by identifying hirns elf with \nchange, he would become the leader of the new order, making the king de­\npendent on hirn. But there was a problem in his strategy : Like a billiard \nball hit too hard against the cushion, his reforms had reactions and caroms \nhe did not envision and could not control. \nThe man who initiates strong reforms often becomes the scapegoat for \nany kind of dissatisfaction. And eventually the reaction to his reforms may \nconsume hirn, for change is upsetting to the human animal, even when it is \nfor the good. Because the world is and always has been full of insecurity \nand threat, we latch on to familiar faces and create habits and rituals to \nmake the world more comfortable. Change can be pleasant and even \nsometimes desirable in the abstract, but too much of it creates an anxiety \nthat will stir and boil beneath the surface and then eventually erupt. \nNever underestimate the hidden conservatism of those around you. It \nis powerful and entrenc hed. Never let the seductive charm of an idea cloud \nyour reason: lust as you cannot make people see the world your way, you \ncannot wrench them into the future with painful changes. They will rebel. \nIf reform is necessary, anticipate the re action against it and find ways to \ndisguise the change and sweeten the poison. \nOBSERVANCE OF THE LAW \nAs a young Communist in the 1920s, Mao Tse-tung underst ood better than \nany of his colleagues the incredible odds against a Communist victory in \nChina. With their small numbers, limited funds, lack of military experi­\nence, and small arsenal of weapons, the Party had no hope of success un­\nless it won over China's immense peasant population. But who in the \nworld was more conservative, more rooted in tradition, than the Chinese \npeasantry? The oldest civilization on the planet had a history that would \nnever loosen its power, no matter how violent the revolution. The ideas of \nConfucius remained as alive in the 1920s as they had been in the sixth cen­\ntury B.C., when the philosopher was alive. Despite the oppressions of the \ncurrent system, would the peasantry ever give up the deep-rooted values of \nthe past for the great unknown of Commun ism? \nThe solution, as Mao saw it, involved a simple deception: Cloak the \nrevolution in the clothing of the past, making it comforting and legitimate \nin people's eyes. One of Mao's favorite books was the very popular me­\ndieval Chinese novel The Water Margin, which recounts the exploits of a \nChinese Robin Hood and his robber band as they struggle against a cor­\nrupt and evil monarch . In China in Mao's time, family ties dominated over \nany other kind, for the Confucian hierarchy of father and oldest son re­\nmained firmly in place; but The Water Margin preached a superior value­\nthe fraternal ties of the band of robbers, the nobility of the cause that unites \npeople beyond blood. The novel had great emotional resonance for Chi­\nnese people, who love to root for the underdog. Time and again, then, \nMao would present his revolutionary army as an extension of the robber \nband in The Water Margin, likening his struggle to the timeless conflict be­\ntween the oppressed peasantry and an evil emperor. He made the past \nseem to envelop and legitimize the Communist cause; the peasantry could \nfeel comfortable with and even support a group with such roots in the past. \nEven on ce the Party came to power, Mao continued to associate it with \nthe past. He presented himself to the masses not as a Chinese Lenin but as \na modern Chuko Liang, the real-life third-century strategist who figures \nprominently in the popular historical novel The Romance 0/ the Three King­\ndoms. Liang was more than a great general-he was a poet, a philosoph er, \nand a figure of stern moral rectitude. So Mao represented himself as a poet­\nwarrior like Liang, a man who mixed strategy with philosophy and \npreached a new ethics. He made himself appear like a hero from the great \nChinese tradition of warrior statesmen. \nSoon, everything in Mao's speeches and writings had a reference to an \nearlier period in Chinese history. He recalled, for example, the great Em­\nperor Ch'in, who had unified the country in the third century B.C. Ch'in \nhad burned the works of Confucius, consolidated and completed the build­\ning of the Great Wall, and given his name to China. Like Ch'in, Mao also \nhad brought the country together, and had sought bold reforms against an \noppressive past. Ch'in had traditionally been seen as a violent dictator \nwhose reign was short; the brilliance of Mao's strategy was to turn this \naround, simultaneously reinterpreting Ch'in, justifying his rule in the eyes \nof present-day Chinese, and using him to justify the violence of the new \norder that Mao himself was creating. \nMter the failed Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s, apower struggle \nLAW 45 395 \n396 LAW 45 emerged in the Communist Party in which Mao's main foe was Lin Piao, \nonce a elose friend of his. To make elear to the masses the difference be­\ntween his philosophy and Lin's, Mao once again exploited the past: He \ncast his opponent as representing Confucius, a philosopher Lin in fact \nwould constantly quote. And Confucius signified the conservatism of the \npast. Mao associated himse lf, on the other hand, with the ancient philo­\nsophical movement known as Legalism, exemplified by the writings of \nHan-f ei-tzu. The Legalists disdained Confucian ethic s; they believed in the \nneed for violence to create a new order . They worshiped power. To give \nhirnself weight in the strug gle, Mao unleashed a nationwide propa ganda \ncampaign against Confucius, using the issues of Confucianism versus Le­\ngalism to whip the young into a kind of frenzied revolt against the older \ngenerat ion. This grand context enveloped a rather banal power struggle, \nand Mao once again won over the masses and triump hed over his enemies. \nInterpretation \nNo people had a more profound attachment to the past than the Chinese. \nIn the face of this enormous obstaele to reform, Mao's strategy was simple : \nInstead of struggling against the past, he turned it to his advantage, associ­\nating his radical Communists with the romantic figures of Chinese history. \nWeaving the story of the War of the Three Kingdoms into the struggle be­\ntween the United State s, the Soviet Union, and China, he cast hirnself as \nChuko Liang. As the emperors had, he welcomed the cultlike adoration of \nthe masses, understanding that the Chinese could not function without \nsome kind of father figure to adm ire. And after he made a terrible blunder \nwith the Great Leap Forward, trying to force modernization on the country \nand failing miserably, he never repeated his mista ke: From then on, radical \nchange had to be eloaked in the comf ortable elothes of the past. \nThe lesson is simple: The past is powerful. What has happened before \nseems greate r; habit and history give any act weight. Use this to your ad­\nvantage . When you destroy the familiar you create a void or vacuum ; peo­\npIe fear the chaos that will flood in to fill it. You must avoid stirring up such \nfe ars at all cost. Borrow the weight and legitimacy from the past, however \nremote, to create a comf orting and familiar presence. This will give your \nactions romantic associations, add to your presence, and eloak the nature \nof the changes you are attempting. \nIt must be conside red that there is nothing more difficult to carry out, \nnor more doubt ful 0/ success, nor more dangerous to handle, \nthan to initiate a new order 0/ things. \nNiccolo Machia velli, 1469-1527 \nKEYS TO POWER \nHuman psychology contains many dualiti es, one of them being that even \nwhile people understand the need for change, knowing how important it is \nfor institutions and individuals to be occasiona lly renewed, they are also ir-\nritated and upset by changes that affect them personally. They know that \nchange is neces sary, and that novelty provides relief from boredom, but \ndeep inside they cling to the past. Change in the abstract, or superficial \nchange, they desire, but a change that upsets core habits and routines is \ndeeply disturbing to them. \nNo revolution has gone without a powerftIl later reaction against it, for \nin the long run the void it creates proves too unsettling to the human ani­\nmal, who unconsciously associates such voids with death and chao s. The \noppor tunity for change and renewal seduces people to the side of the revo­\nlution, but once their enthusiasm fades, which it will, they are left with a \ncertain empti ness. Yearning for the past, they create an opening for it to \ncreep back in. \nFor Machia velli, the prophet who preaches and brings change can \nonly survive by taking up arms: When the masses inevitably yearn for the \npast, he must be ready to use force. But the armed prophet cannot last long \nunless he quickly creates a new set of values and rituals to replace the old \nones, and to soothe the anxieties of those who dread chan ge. It is far easier, \nand less bloody, to play akind of con game. Preach change as much as you \nlike, and even enact your reforms, but give them the comforting appear­\nance of older events and traditi ons. \nReigning from A.D. 8 to A.D. 23, the Chinese emperor Wang Mang \nemerged from aperiod of great historical turbulence in which the people \nyearned for order, an order represented for them by Confucius. Some two \nhundred years earlier, however, Emperor Ch'in had ordered the writings \nof Confucius burned. A few years later, word had spread that certain texts \nhad miraculously surviv ed, hidden under the scholar's house. These texts \nmay not have been genuin e, but they gave Wang his opportunity : He first \nconfiscated them, then had his scribes insert passages into them that \nseemed to support the changes he had been imposing on the country. \nWhen he released the texts, it seemed that Confucius sanctioned Wang's \nreforms, and the people feIt comforted and accepted them more easily. \nUnderstand : The fact that the past is dead and buried gives you the \nfreedom to reinterpret it. To support YOUT cause, tinker with the facts. The \npast is a text in which you can safely insert YOUT own lines. \nA simple ge sture like using an old title, or keeping the same number \nfor a group, will tie you to the past and support you with the authority of \nhistory. As Machiavelli hirnself observed, the Romans used this device \nwhen they transf ormed their monarchy into a republic. They may have in­\nstalled two consuls in place of the king, but since the king had been served \nby twelve lictors, they retain ed the same number to serve under the con­\nsuls. The king had personally perform ed an annual sacrifice, in a great \nspectacle that stirred the public; the republic retained this pract ice, only \ntransferring it to a special \"chief of the ceremony, whom they called the \nKing of the sacri fice.\" These and similar ge stures satisfied the people and \nkept them from clamoring for the monarchy's return. \nAnother strategy to disguise change is to make a loud and public dis­\nplay of support for the values of the past. Seem to be a zealot for tradition \nLAW 45 397 \n398 LAW 45 and few will notice how unconventional you really are. Renaissance Flo­\nrence had a centuries-old republic, and was suspicious of anyone who \nflouted its traditi ons. Cosimo de' Medici made a show of enthu siastic sup­\nport for the republic, while in reality he worked to bring the city under the \ncontrol of his wealthy family. In form, the Medicis retained the appearance \nof a republic; in substa nce, they rendered it powerless. They quietly en­\nacted a radical change, while appearing to saf eguard tradi tion. \nScience claims a search for truth that would seem to protect it from \nconservatism and the irrationality of habit: It is a culture of innovation. Yet \nwhen Charles Darwin published his ideas of evolution, he faced fiercer op­\nposition from his fellow scientists than from religious authorit ies. His theo­\nries challenged too many fixed ideas. Jonas Salk ran into the same wall \nwith his radical innovations in immunology, as did Max Planck with his \nrevolutionizing of physics. Planck later wrote of the scientific opposition he \nfaced, \"A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents \nand making them see the light, but rather beca use its opponents eventually \ndie, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.\" \nThe answer to this innate conservatism is to play the cOUftier's game. \nGalileo did this at the beginning of his scientific career; he later became \nmore confrontational, and paid for it. So pay lip service to tradit ion. Iden­\ntify the elements in YOUf revolution that can be made to seem to build on \nthe past. Say the right things, make a show of conformity, and meanwhile \nlet YOUf theories do their radical work. Play with appeara nces and respect \npast protocol. This is true in every arena -science being no exception. \nFinally, powerful people pay attention to the zeitg eist. If their reform is \ntoo far ahead of its time, few will understand it, and it will stir up anxiety \nand be hopelessly misinter preted. The changes you make must seem less \ninnovative than they are. England did eventually become a Protestant na­\ntion, as Cromwell wished, but it took over a century of gradual evolutio n. \nWatch the zeitgeist. If you work in a tumultuous time, there is power to \nbe gained by preaching areturn to the past, to comfort, traditi on, and rit­\nual. During aperiod of stagna tion, on the other hand, play the card of re­\nform and revolution -but beware of what you stir up. Those who finish a \nrevolution are rarely those who start it. You will not succeed at this danger­\nous game unless you are willing to fore stall the inevitable re action again st it \nby playing with appeara nces and building on the past. \nAuthority : He who desires or attempts to reform the government of a \nstate, and wishes to have it accepted, must at least retain the semblance of \nthe oid forms; so that it may seem to the people that there has been no \nchange in the institut ions, even though in fact they are entirely different \nfrom the oid ones. For the great majority of mankind are satisfied with ap­\npeara nces, as though they were realit ies. (Niccolö Machiavelli, 1469- 1527) \nREVERSAL Image: The Cat. \nCreature of habit, it loves the \nwarmth of the familiar. Upset its \nroutines, disrupt its space, and it will \ngrow unmanageable and psychotic. \nPlacate it by supporting its rituals. If \nchange is necessary, deceive the cat by \nkeeping the smell of the past alive; \nplace objects familiar to it in \nstrategie locations. \nThe past is a corpse to be used as you see fit. If what happened in the re­\ncent past was painful and harsh, it is self-destructive to associate yourself \nwith it. When Napoleon came to power, the French Revolution was fresh \nin everyone's minds. If the court that he established had borne any resem­\nblance to the lavish court of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, his courtiers \nwould have spent all their time worrying about their own necks. Instead, \nNapoleon established a court remarkable for its sobriety and lack of osten­\ntation. It was the court of a man who valued work and military virtues. This \nnew form seemed appropriate and reassuring. \nIn other words, pay attention to the times. But understand: If you \nmake a bold change from the past, you must avoid at all costs the appear­\nance of a void or vacuum, or you will create terror. Even an ugly recent his­\ntory will seem preferable to an empty space. Fill that space immediately \nwith new rituals and forms. Soothing and growing familiar, these will seeure \nyour position among the masses. \nFinally, the arts, fashion, and technology would seem to be areas in \nwhich power would come from creating a radical rupture with the past and \nappearing cutting edge. Indeed, such a strategy can bring great power, but \nit has many dangers. It is inevitable that your innovations will be outdone \nby someone else. You have little control-someone younger and fresher \nmoves in a sudden new direction, making your bold innovation of yester­\nday seem tiresome and tarne today. You are forever playing catch-up; your \npower is tenuous and short-lived. You want a power built on something \nmore solid. Using the past, tinkering with tradition, playing with conven­\ntion to subvert it will give your creations something more than a momen­\ntary appeal. Periods of dizzying change disguise the fact that a yearning for \nthe past will inevitably creep back in. In the end, using the past for your \nown purposes will bring you more power than trying to cut it out com­\npletely-a futile and self-destructive endeavor. \nLAW 45 399 \n400 LAW \n46 \nNEVER APPE AR \nTa O PERFECT \nJUDGMENT \nAppearing better than others is always dangerous, but \nmost dangerous of all is to appear to have no faults or \nweaknesses. Envy creates silent enemies. It is smart to oc­\ncasionally display deJects, and admit to harmless vices, \nin order to deflect envy and appear more human and ap­\nproachable. Only gods and the dead can seem perfect \nwith impunity. \nTRANSGR ESSION OF THE LAW \nJoe Orton met Kenneth Halliwell at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts, \nLondon, in 1953, where both had enrolled as acting students . They so on \nbecame lovers and moved in together. Halliwell, twenty-five at the time, \nwas seven years older than Orton, and seemed the more confident of the \ntwo; but neither had much talent as actors, and after graduating, having set­\ntled down together in a dank London apartment, they decided to give up \nacting and collaborate as writers instead. Halliwell's inheritance was \nenough to keep them from having to find work for a few years, and in the \nbeginning, he was also the driving force behind the stories and novels they \nwrote; he would dictate to Orton, who would type the manuscripts, occa­\nsionally inteIjecting his own lines and ideas. Their first efforts attracted \nsome interest from literary agents, but it sputtered. The promise they had \nshown was leading nowhere . \nEventually the inheritance money ran out, and the pair had to look for \nwork. Their collaborations were less enthusiastic and less frequent. The fu­\nture looked bleak. \nIn 1957 Orton began to write on his own, but it wasn't until five years \nlater, when the lovers were jailed for six months for defacing dozens of li­\nbrary books, that he began to find his voice (perhaps not by chance: This \nwas the first time he and Halliwell had been separated in nine years). He \ncame out of prison determined to express his contempt for English society \nin the form of theatrical farces. He and Halliwell moved back in together, \nbut now the roles were reversed: Orton did the writing while Halliwell put \nin comments and ideas. \nIn 1964 Joe Orton completed his first full-len gth play, EnteTtaining MT. \nSloane. The play made it to London's West End, where it received brilliant \nreviews: A great new writer had emerged from nowhere . Now success fol­\nlowed s lccess, at a dizzying pace. In 1966 Orton had a hit with his play \nLoot, and his popularity soared. Soon commissions came in from all sides, \nincluding from the Beatles, who paid Orton handsomely to write them a \nfilm script. \nEverything was pointing upwards, everything except Orton's relation­\nship with Kenneth Halliwell. The pair still lived together, but as Orton \ngrew successful, Halliwell began to deteriora te. Watching his lover become \nthe center of attention, he suffered the humiliation of becoming a kind of \npersonal assistant to the playwright, his role in what had once been a col­\nlaboration growing smaller and smaller. In the 1950s he had supported \nOrton with his inheritanc e; now Orton supported hirn. At a party or \namong friends, people would naturally gravitate towards Orton-he was \ncharming, and his mood was almost always buoyant. Unlike the handsome \nOrton, Halliwell was bald and awkward; his defensiveness made people \nwant to avoid hirn. \nWith Orton's success the couple's problems only worsened. Halliwell's \nmoods made their life together impossibl e. Orton claimed to want to leave \nhirn, and had numerous affairs, but would always end up returning to his TIIE I'ARABU : 01\" Tm: \nCHf :EDY �lA\\i A \\if) THE \nE\\iVl Ol:S MAr-. \nA greedy man and an \nenvious man met a \nking.

In May of 1967, the \npair went on abrief holiday together in Tangier, Morocco. During the trip, \nOrton wrote in his diary, \"We sat talking of how happy we feIt. And how it \ncouldn't, surely, last. We'd have to pay for it. Or we'd be struck down from \nafar by disaster because we were, perhaps, too happy. To be young, good­\nlooking, healthy, famous, comparatively rich and happy is surely going \nagainst nature .\" \nHalliwell outwardly seemed as happy as Orton. Inwardly, though, he \nwas seething. And two months later, in the early moming of August 10, \n1967, just days after helping Orton put the finishing touch es to the wicked \nfa' ce What the Butler Saw (undoubtedly his masterpiece), Kenneth Halliwell \nbludgeoned Joe Orton to death with repeated blows of a h ammer to the \nhead. He then took twenty-one sleeping pills and died hirnself , leaving be­\nhind a note that read, \"If you read Orton's diary all will be explained.\" \nInterpretation \nKenneth Halliwell had tried to cast his deterioration as mental illness, but \nwhat Joe Orton's diaries revealed to hirn was the truth: It was envy, pure \nand simple, that lay at the heart of his sickness. The diaries, which Halli­\nweIl read on the sly, recounted the couple's days as equals and their strug­\ngle for recogniti on. After Orton found success, the diaries began to \ndescribe Halliw ell's brooding, his rude comments at parties, his growing \nsense of inferiority. All of this Orton narrated with a distance that bordered \non contempt. \nThe diaries made clear Halliw ell's bittemess over Orton's success. \nEventually the only thing that would have satisfied hirn would have been \nfor Orton to have a failure of his own, an unsuccessful play perhaps, so that \nthey could have commiserated in their failure, as they had done years be­\nfore. When the opposite happened-as Orton grew only more successful \nand popular-Halliwell did the only thing that would make them equals \nagain: He made them equals in death. With Orton's murder, he became al­\nmost as famous as his friend-p osthumously. \nJoe Orton only partly underst ood his lover's deteriorat ion. His attempt \nto help Halliwell iaunch a career in art registered for what it was: charity \nand guilt. Orton basically had two possible solutions to the problem. He \ncould have downplayed his own success, displaying some faults, deflecting \nHalliwell 's envy; or, once he realized the nature of the problem, he could \nhave fled as if Halliwell were a viper, as in fact he was-a viper of envy. \nOnce envy eats away at someone, everything you do only makes it grow, \nand day by day it festers inside hirn. Eventually he will attack. \nOnly a minority can succeed at the game of life, and that minority in­\nevitably arouses the envy of those around them. Once success happens \nyour way, however, the people to fear the most are those in your own cir­\ncle, the friends and acquaintances you have left behind. Feelings of inferi-\nority gnaw at them; the thought of your success only heightens their feel­\nings of stagnat ion. Envy, which the philosopher Kierkegaard calls \"un­\nhappy admirat ion,\" takes hold. You may not see it but you will feel it \nsomeda y-unless, that is, you leam strategies of deflection, little sacrifices \nto the gods of success. Either dampen your brilliance occasionally, pur­\nposefully revealing a defect, weakne ss, or anxiety, or attributing your suc­\ncess to luck; or simply find yourself new frien ds. Never underesti mate the \npower of envy. \nOBSER VANCE OF THE LAW \nThe merchant dass and the craft guilds to which medieval Florence owed \nits prosper ity had created a republic that protected them from oppression \nby the nobility. Since high of fice could only be held for a few months, no \none could gain lasting dominanc e, and although this meant that the politi­\ncal factions struggl ed const antly for control, the system kept out tyrants \nand petty dictat ors. The Medici family lived for several centuries under this \nsystem without making much of a mark. They had modest origins as \napothecari es, and were typical middle-dass citizens. Not until the late four­\nteenth century, when Giovanni de' Medici made a modest fortune in bank­\ning, did they emerge as a force to be reckoned with. \nUpon Giovanni 's death, his son Cosimo took over the family business, \nand quickly demonstrated his talent for it. The business prospered under \nhis control and the Medicis emerged as one of the preeminent banking \nfamilies of Europ e. But they had a riyal in Flore nce: Despite the cit y's re­\npublican system, one family, the Albizzis, had managed over the years to \nmonopolize control of the govemment, forging alliances that allowed them \nto constantly fill important offices with their own men. Cosimo did not \nfight this, and in fact gave the Albizzis his tacit support. At the same time, \nwhile the Albizzis were beginning to flaunt their power, Cosimo made a \npoint of staying in the background. \nEventually, however, the Medici wealth could not be ig nored, and in \n1433, feeling threate ned by the family, the Albizzis used their govemment \nmusde to have Cosimo arrested on charges of conspiring to overthrow the \nrepublic. Some in the Albizzi faction wanted Cosimo executed, others \nfeared this would spark a civil war. In the end they exiled hirn from Flo­\nrence. Cosimo did not fight the sentenc e; he left quietly. Sometimes, he \nknew, it is wiser to bide one's time and keep a low profile. \nOver the next year, the Albizzis began to stir up fears that they were \nsetting up a dictat orship . Meanw hile, Cosimo, using his wealth to advan­\ntage, continued to exert influe nce on Florentine affairs, even from exile. A \ncivil war broke out in the city, and in September of 1434 the Albizzis were \ntopp led from power and sent into exile. Cosimo immediately retumed to \nFlorence, his position restore d. But he saw that he now faced a delicate sit­\nuation: If he seemed amb itious, as the Albizzis had, he would stir up oppo­\nsition and envy that would ultimately threaten his busine ss. If he stayed on she squinted horrihly; \nher teeth were disco 1-\nored and decayed, her \npoisonous breast of a \ngreenish hue, and her \ntongue dripped venom. \nOnly the sight of \nsuffering could bring a \nsmile to her fips.

A.D. 18 \n404 LAW 46 the sidelines, on the other hand, he would leave an opening for another \nfaction to rise up as the Albizzis had, and to punish the Medicis for their \nsuccess_ \nCosimo solved the problem in two ways: He secretly used his wealth \nto buy influence among key citizens, and he placed his own allies, all dev­\nerly enlisted from the middle dasses to disguise their allegiance to him, in \ntop government positions. Those who complain ed of his growing political \ndout were taxed into submission, or their propert ies were bought out from \nunder them by Cosimo's banker allies. The republic survived in name \nonly. Cosimo held the strings. \nWhile he worked behind the scenes to gain control, however, publidy \nCosimo presented another picture. When he walked through the streets of \nF1orence, he dressed modestly, was attended by no more than one ser­\nvant, and bowed deferentially to magistrate s and eIder citizens. He rode a \nmule instead of a horse. He never spoke out on matters of public import, \neven though he controlled F1or ence's foreign affairs for over thirty years. \nHe gave money to charities and maintain ed his ties to F1orence's merchant \ndass. He financed all kinds of public buildings that fed the F1orent ines' \npride in their city. When he built a palace for hirnself and his family in \nnearby Fiesoie, he turned down the ornate designs that Brunelleschi \nhad drawn up for hirn and instead chose a modest structure designed by \nMicheloz zo, a man of humble F10rentine origins. The palace was a symbol \nof Cosimo's strategy-all simplicity on the outside, all elegance and opu­\nlence within. \nCosimo finally died in 1464, after ruling for thirty years. The citizens \nof F10rence wanted to build hirn a great tomb, and to celebrate his memory \nwith elaborate funeral ceremonies, but on his deathbed he had asked to be \nburied without \"any pomp or demonstra tion.\" Some sixty years later, \nMachiavelli hailed Cosimo as the wisest of all princes, \"for he knew how \nextraordinary things that are seen and appear every hour make men much \nmore envied than those that are done in deed and are covered over with \ndecency. \" \nInterpretation \nA dose friend of Cosimo's, the bookseller Vespasiano da Bisticci, once \nwrote of hirn, ''And whenever he wished to achieve something, he saw to it, \nin order to escape envy as much as possible, that the initiative appeared to \ncome from others, and not from hirn.\" One of Cosimo 's favorite expres­\nsions was, \"Envy is a weed that should not be watere d.\" Understanding the \npower envy has in a democratic environment, Cosimo avoided the appear­\nance of greatness. This does not mean that greatne ss should be suffocated, \nor that only the mediocre should survive; only that agame of appearances \nmust be played. The insidious envy of the masses can actually be deflected \nquite easily : Appear as one of them in style and values. Make alliances with \nthose below you, and elevate them to positions of power to secure their \nsupport in times of need. Never flaunt your wealth, and carefully conceal \nthe degree to which it has bought influence. Make a display of deferring to \nothers, as if they were more powerful than you. Cosimo de' Medici per­\nfected this game; he was a consummate con artist of appeara nces. No one \ncould gauge the extent of his power-his modest exterior hid the truth. \nNever be so foolish as to believe that you are stirring up admiration by \nflaunting the qualities that raise you above others. By making others aware \nof their inferior position, you are only stirring up \"unhappy admira tion,\" or \nenvy, which will gnaw away at them until they undermine you in ways you \ncannot foresee. The fool dares the gods of envy by flaunting his victories. \nThe master of power understands that the appearance of superiority over \nothers is inconsequential next to the reality of it. \nOf alt the disor ders of the soul, envy is the only one no one confesses to. \nPlutarch, c. A.lJ. 46-120 \nKEYS TO POWER \nThe human animal has a hard time dealing with feelings of inferiority. In \nthe face of superior skill, talent, or power, we are often disturb ed and ill at \nease; this is because most of us have an inflated sense of ourselves, and \nwhen we meet people who surpass us they make it dear to us that we are in \nfact mediocre, or at least not as brilliant as we had thought. This distur­\nbance in our self-image cannot last long without stirring up ugly emotions. \nAt first we feel envy: If only we had the quality or skill of the superior per­\nson, we would be happy. But envy brings us neither comfort nor any doser \nto equality. Nor can we admit to feeling it, for it is frowned upon socially­\nto show envy is to admit to feeling inferior. To dose friends, we may con­\nfess our secret unrealized desires, but we will never confess to feeling envy. \nSo it goes underground. We disguise it in many ways, like finding grounds \nto criticize the person who makes us feel it: He may be smarter than I am, \nwe say, but he has no morals or conscience. Or he may have more power, \nbut that's because he cheats. If we do not slander hirn, perhaps we praise \nhirn excessi vely-another of envy's disguises. \nThere are several strategies for dealing with the insidious, destructive \nemotion of envy. First, accept the fact that there will be people who will \nsurpass you in some way, and also the fact that you may envy them. But \nmake that feeling a way of pushing yourself to equal or surpass thern some­\nday. Let envy turn inward and it poisons the soul; expel it outward and it \ncan move you to greater heights. \nSecond, understand that as you gain power, those below you will feel \nenvious of you. They may not show it but it is inevita ble. Do not naively ac­\ncept the facade they show you-read between the lines of their criticisms, \ntheir little sarcastic remarks, the signs of backstabbing, the excessive praise \nthat is preparing you for a fall, the resentful look in the eye. Half the prob­\nlem with envy comes when we do not recognize it until it is too late. \nFinally, expect that when people envy you they will work against you The envious hides as \ncarefully lIS the secret, \nlustful sinner lind \nbecomes Ihe endless \ninventor of tricks and \nstrllillgems 10 hide and \nmask himself Thus he \nis able to pretend to \nignore the superiority \nof others which eats up \nhis heart, as if he <lid \nnot see them, nor hellr \nthem, nor were aWllre \nof them, nor hat! ever \nheard of them. Ile is 1I \nmaster simulator. On \nthe other hllnd he tries \nwith all his power to \nconnive lind thus \nprevent lIny form of \nsuperiority from \nappearing in any situa­\ntion. And if they do, he \ncasts on them obscu­\nrity, hypercriticism, \nsarcasm and calumny \nlike Ihe load that spils \npoison from its hole. \nOn the other hand he \nwill raise endlessly \ninsignijicant men, \nmediocre people, and \neven the inferior in the \nsame type of activilies. \nARTHUR \nSCHOPENIIAUER. \n1788-1860 \nFor not many men, the \nproverb says, call love a \nfriend who fortune \nprospers wilhout feel­\ning envy; and about the \nenvious brain, cold \npoison clings and \ndoubles all the pain fife \nbrings him.

They will put obstacles in your path that you will not foresee, \nor that you cannot trace to their source. It is hard to defend yourself against \nthis kind of attack. And by the time you realize that envy is at the root of a \nperson's feelings about you, it is often too late: Your excuses, your false hu­\nmility, your defensive actions, only exacerbate the problem. Since it is far \neasier to avoid creating envy in the first place than to get rid of it once it is \nthere, you should strategize to forestall it before it grows . It is often your \nown actions that stir up envy, your own unawa reness. By becoming con­\nscious of those actions and qualiti es that create envy, you can take the teeth \nout of it before it nibbles you to death . \nKierkegaard believed that there are types of people who create envy, \nand are as guilty when it arises as those who feel it. The most obvious type \nwe all know: The moment something good happens to them, whether by \nluck or design, they crow about it. In fact they get pleasure out of making \npeople feel inferior. This type is obvious and beyond hope. There are oth­\ners, however, who stir up envy in more subtle and unconscious ways, and \nare partly to blame for their troubles. Envy is often a problem, for exam­\npIe, for people with great natural talent. \nSir Walter Raleigh was one of the most brilliant men at the court of \nQueen Elizabeth of Engla nd. He had skills as a scientist, wrote poetry still \nrecognized as among the most beautiful writing of the time, was a proven \nleader of men, an enterprising entrepreneur, a great sea captain, and on \ntop of all this was a handsome, dashing courtier who charmed his way into \nbecoming one of the queen's favorite s. Wherever he went, however, peo­\npIe blocked his path . Eventually he suffered a terrific fall from grace, lead­\ning even to prison and finally the executio ner's axe. \nRaleigh could not understand the stubbom opposition he faced from \nthe other court iers. He did not see that he had not only made no attempt to \ndisguise the degree of his skills and qualities, he had imposed them on one \nand all, making a show of his versatility, thinking it impressed people and \nwon hirn friends. In fact it made hirn silent enemies, people who feIt infe­\nrior to hirn and did all they could to ruin hirn the moment he tripped up or \nmade the slightest mistake. In the end, the reason he was executed was \ntreason, but envy will use any cover it finds to mask its destructivene ss. \nThe envy elicited by Sir WaIter Raleigh is the worst kind: It was in­\nspired by his natural talent and gra ce, which he feIt was best displayed in \nits full flower. Money others can attain; power as weIl. But superior intelli­\ngence, good looks, charm-t hese are qualities no one can acquire. The nat­\nurally perfeet have to work the most to disguise their brillia nce, displaying \nadefeet or two to deflect envy before it takes root. It is a common and \nnaive mistake to think you are charming people with your natural talents \nwhen in fact they are coming to hate you. \nA great danger in the realm of power is the sudden improvement in for­\ntune-an unexpected promotion, a victory or success that seems to come \nout of nowhere. This is sure to stir up envy among your former peers. \nWhen Archbishop de Retz was promoted to the rank of cardinal, in \n1651, he knew full weIl that many of his former colleagues envied hirn. \nUnderst anding the foolishness of alienating those below hirn, de Retz did \neverything he could to downplay his merit and emphasize the role of luck \nin his success. To put people at ease, he acted humbly and deferentially, as if \nnothing had change d. (In reality, of course, he now had much more power \nthan before.) He wrote that these wise policies \"produced a good effect, by \nlessening the envy which was conceived again st me, which is the greatest of \nall secrets.\" Follow de Retz's example. Subtly emphasize how lucky you \nhave been, to make your happiness seem more attain able to other people, \nand the need for envy less acute. But be careful not to affect a false modesty \nthat people can easily see through. This will only make them more enviou s. \nThe act has to be good; your humility, and your openness to those you have \nleft behind, have to seem genui ne. Any hint of insincerity will only make \nyour new status more oppressive . Rememb er: Despite your elevated posi­\ntion, it will do you no good to alienate your former peers. Power requires a \nwide and solid support base, which envy can silently destroy. \nPolitical power of any kind creates envy, and one of the best ways to \ndeflect it before it takes root is to seem unambi tious. When Ivan the Terri­\nble died, Boris Godunov knew he was the only one on the scene who could \nlead Russia. But if he sought the position eagerly, he would stir up envy \nand suspicion among the boyars, so he refused the crown, not once but \nseveral time s. He made people insist that he take the throne. George Wash­\nington used the same strategy to great effect, first in refusing to keep the po­\nsition of Commander in Chief of the American army, second in resisting \nthe presidency. In both cases he made hirnself more popular than ever. \nPeople cannot envy the power that they themselves have given a person \nwho does not seem to desire it. \nAccording to the Elizabethan statesman and writer Sir Francis Bacon, \nthe wisest policy of the powerful is to create a kind of pity for themselves, \nas if their responsibilities were a burden and a sacri fice. How can one envy \na man who has taken on a heavy load for the public interest? Disguise your \npower as a kind of self-sacrifice rather than a source of happin ess and you \nmake it seem less enviable. Emphasize your troubl es and you turn a poten­\ntial danger (envy) into a source ofmoral support (pity) . A similar ploy is to \nhint that your good fortune will benefit those around you. To do this you \nmay need to open your purse strings, like Cimon, a wealthy general in an­\ncient Athens who gave lavishly in all kinds of ways to prevent people from \nresenting the influence he had bought in Athenian polit ics. He paid a high \nprice to deflect their envy, but in the end it saved hirn from ostracism and \nbanishment from the city. \nThe painter J. M. W. Turner devised another way of giving to deflect \nthe envy of his fellow artists, which he recognized as his greatest obstacle to \nhis success. Noticing that his incomparable color skills made them afraid to \nhang their paintings next to his in exhibitio ns, he realiz ed that their fear \nwould turn to envy, and would eventually make it harder for hirn to find \ngalleries to show in. On occasion, then, Turner is known to have tempo rar­\nily damp ened the colors in his paintings with soot to earn hirn the goodwill \nof his colleag ues. one of his men to have \nthem embarked. He \nhimself returned to \nRome. \n... The quantity of \nmarbles was immense, \nso that, spread over the \npiazza, they were the \nadmiration of all and a \njoy to the pope, who \nheaped immeasurable \nfavors upon Michelan­\ngelo; and when he \nbegan to work upon \nthem again and again \nwent to see him at his \nhouse, and talked to \nhim about the tomb \nand other things as \nwith his own brather. \nAnd in order that he \nmight more easily go to \nhim, the pope ordered \nthat a drawbridge \nshould be thrown \nacross fram the Corri­\ndore to the raoms of \nMichelangelo, by which \nhe might visit him in \nprivate. \nThese many and \nfrequent favors were \nthe cause (as often is \nthe case at court) of \nmuch envy, and, after \nthe envy, of endless \npersecution, since \nBraman te, the architect, \nwho was loved hy the \npope, made him change \nhis mind as to the \nmonument hy te/Ung \nhim, as is said by the \nvulgar, that it is \nunlucky to build one's \ntomh in one's lifetime, \nand other tales. Fear as \nwelt as envy stimulated \nBramante, for the judg­\nment of Michelangelo \nhad exposed many of \nhis errars .... Now \nbecause he had no \ndouht that Michelan­\ngelo knew these errars \nof his, he always sought \nto remove him from \nRome, or, at least, to \ndeprive him of the \nLAW 46 407 \nfavor ofthe pope, and \nofthe glory and useful­\nness that he might have \nacquired by his indus­\ntry. He sllcceeded in the \nmatter of the 10mb. \nThere is no doubt that \nif Michelangelo had \nbeen allowed to finish \nit, according to his first \ndesign, having so large \na field in which to show \nhis worth, no other \nartist, however cele­\nbrated (be it said with-\nout envy) could have \nwrested from hirn the \nhigh place he would \nhave held. \nVITA DI MICHEL ANGELO, \nASCANIO CONDIVI, \n1553 \nDid ever anybody seri­\nously confess to envy? \nSomething there is in it \nuniversally feit to be \nmore shameful than \neven felonious crime. \nAnd not only does \neverybody disown it, \nbut the better sort are \ninclined to incredulity \nwhen it is in earnest \nimputed 10 an intelli­\ngent man. But since \nludgment is in the heart \nnot the brain, no degree \nuf intellect supplies a \nguarantee against it. \nBII.LY BUDD, \nHERMAN MELVILLE. \n1819 -1891 \n408 LAW 46 To deflect envy, Graciän recommends that the powerful display a \nweak ness, a minor social indiscretion, a harmless vice. Give those who \nenvy you something to feed on, distracting them from your more impor­\ntant sins. Remember: It is the reality that matters. You may have to play \ngames with appearan ces, but in the end you will have what counts : true \npower. In some Arab countries, a man will avoid arousing envy by doing \nas Cosimo de Medici did by showing his wealth only on the inside of his \nhouse. Apply this wisdom to your own character. \nBeware of some of envy's disgu ises. Excessive praise is an almo st sure \nsign that the person praising you envies you; they are either setting you up \nfor a fall-it will be impossible for you to live up to their pra ise-or they \nare sharpening their blades behind your back. At the same time, those who \nare hypercritical of you, or who slander you publicly, probably envy you \nas weIl. Recognize their behavior as disgu ised envy and you keep out of \nthe trap of mutual mud-slinging, or of taking their criticisms to heart. Win \nyour revenge by ignoring their measly presence. \nDo not try to help or do favors for those who envy you; they will think \nyou are condesce nding to them. Joe Orton's attempt to help Halliwell find \na gallery for his work only intensified his lover's feelings of inferiority and \nenvy. Once envy reveals itself for what it is, the only solution is often to \nflee the presence of the enviers, leaving them to stew in a hell of their own \ncrea tion. \nFinally, be aware that some environments are more conducive to envy \nthan others. The eff ects of envy are more serious among colleagues and \npeers, where there is aveneer of equality. Envy is also destructive in demo­\ncratic environments where overt displays of power are looked down upon. \nBe extrasensitive in such environment s. The filmmaker Ingmar Bergman \nwas hounded by Swedish tax authorities because he stood out in a country \nwhere standing out from the crowd is frowned on. It is almost impossible \nto avoid envy in such cases, and there is little you can do but accept it gra­\nciously and take none of it persona lly. As Thoreau once said, \"Envy is the \ntax which all distinction must pay. » \nImage : A Garden of We eds. You may not \nfeed them but they spread as you water \nthe garden. You may not see how, but \nthey take over, taU and ugly, pre­\nventing anything beautiful from \nflourishing. Before it is too late, \ndo not water indis crimi-\nnately. Destroy the weeds \nof envy by giving them \nnothing to feed on. \nAuth ority : Upon occasion, reveal a harmless defect in YOUf charac­\nter. For the envious accuse the most perfeet of sinning by having no \nsins. They become an Argus, all eyes for finding fault with excel­\nlence-it is their only consolation. Do not let envy burst with its own \nvenom -aff ect some lapse in valor or intellect, so as to dis arm it \nbeforehand. You thus wave YOUf red cape before the Horns of Envy, \nin order to save YOUf immortality. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658) \nREVERSAL \nThe reason for being careful with the envious is that they are so indirect, \nand will find innumerable ways to undermine you. But treading carefully \naround them will often only make their envy worse. They sense that you \nare being cautious, and it registers as yet another sign of YOUf superio rity. \nThat is why you must act before envy takes root. \nOnce envy is there, however, whether through YOUf fault or not, it is \nsometimes best to affe ct the opposite appr oach: Display the utmost disdain \nfor those who envy you. Instead of hiding YOUf perf ection, make it obvi­\nous. Make every new triumph an opportunity to make the envious squirm. \nYOUf good fortune and power become their living hell. If you .attain a posi­\ntion of unimpeachable power, their envy will have no effect on you, and \nyou will have the best revenge of all: They are tra pped in envy while you \nare free in YOUf power. \nThis is how Michelangelo triumphed over the venomous architect \nBramante, who turned Pope Julius against Michelange lo's design for his \ntomb . Bramante envied Michelan gelo's godlike skills, and to this one tri­\numph-the aborted tomb project -he thought to add another, by pushing \nthe pope to commission Michelangelo to paint the mUfals in the Sistine \nChapel. The pro ject would take years, during which Michelangelo would \naccomplish no more of his brilliant sculp tures. Furthermore, Bramante \nconsidered Michelangelo not nearly as skilled in painting as in sculpt ure. \nThe chapel would spoil his image as the perf ect arti st. \nMichelangelo saw the trap and wanted to turn down the commission, \nbut he could not refuse the pope, so he accepted it without complaint. \nThen, however, he used Bramant e's envy to SPuf hirn to greater heights, \nmaking the Sistine Chapel his most perfect work of all. Every time Bra­\nmante heard of it or saw it, he feit more oppressed by his own envy-the \nsweetest and most lasting revenge you can exact on the enviou s. Know how to triumph \nover envy and malice. \nHere contempt, \nalthough prudent, \ncounts, indeed, for \nlittle; magnanim ity is \nbetter. A good word \nconcerning one who \nspeaks evil of you \ncannot be praised too \nhighly: there is no \nrevenge more heroie \nthan that broughl \nabout by those merits \nand attainments wh ich \nfrustrate and torment \nthe envious. Every \nstroke of good fortune \nis a further twisl of the \nrope round the neck of \nthe ill-disposed and the \nheaven of the envied is \nhell for the envious. To \nconvert your good \nfortune into poison for \nyour enemies is held to \nbe the most severe \npunishment you can \ninflict on Ihem. The \nenvious man dies not \nonly once but as many \ntimes as Ihe person he \nenvies lives 10 hear the \nvoice of praise; the \neternity of the latters \nfame is the measure of \nthe former's punish­\nmenl: the one is immor­\ntal in his glory, the \nlatter in his misery. The \ntrumpet offame which \nsounds immortality for \nthe one heraids death \nfor the other, who is \nsentenced to be choked \nto death on his own \nenvy. \nBALTASAR GRACIAN, \n1601-1658 \nLAW 46 409 \n410 LAW \n47 \nDO NO T GO PAST THE \nMAR K YO U AIMED FO R; \nIN VICTO RY , \nLEARN WHEN TO STO P \nJUD GMEN T \nThe moment oJ victory is often the moment oJ greatest \npetil.

He def eated Astyages with ease, had himself crow ned \nking of Medea and Persia, and began to forge the Persian Empi re. Victory \nfollowed victory in quick succession . Cyrus defe ated Croesus, ruler of \nLydia, then conquered the Ionian islands and other smaller kingdo ms; he \nmarched on Babyion and crushed it. Now he was known as Cyrus the \nGreat, King of the Wo rld. \nMter capturing the riches of Babyion, Cyrus set his sights on the east, \non the half -barbaric tribes of the Massagetai, a vast realm on the Caspian \nSea. A fierce warrior race led by Queen Tomyris, the Massagetai lacked the \nriches of Babyion, but Cyrus decided to attack them anyway, believing \nhimself superhuman and incapa ble of defeat. The Massagetai would fall \neasily to his vast armies, making his empire imme nse. \nIn 529 B.C., then, Cyrus marched to the wide river Ara xes, gateway to \nthe kingdom of the Massagetai. As he set up camp on the western bank, he \nreceived a message from Queen Tomyr is: \"King of the Medes,\" she told \nhirn, \"I advi se you to abandon this enterpr ise, for you cannot know if in the \nend it will do you any good. Rule yoUf own people, and try to bear the \nsight of me ruling mine . But of course you will refuse my advice, as the last \nthing you wish for is to live in peace.\" Tomyris, confident of her army's \nstrength and not wishing to delay the inevitable battle, offered to withdraw \nthe troops on her side of the river, allowing Cyrus to cross its waters safely \nand fight her army on the eastern side, if that was his desi re. \nCyrus agreed, but instead of engaging the enemy directly he decided \nto play atrick. The Massa getai knew few luxuries. Once Cyrus had crossed \nthe river and made his camp on the eastern side, he set the table for an \nelaborate banquet, full of meat, delicacies, and strong wine. Then he left \nhis weakest troops in the camp and withdrew the rest of the army to the \nriver. A large Massagetai detachment so on attacked the camp and killed all \nof the Persian soldiers in a fierce battle . Then, overwhelme d by the fabu­\nlous feast that had been left behind, they ate and drank to their hearts' con­\ntent. Later, inevitably, they fell asleep. The Persian army returned to the \ncamp that night, killing many of the sleeping soldiers and capturing the \nrest. Among the prisoners was their general, a youth named Sparga pises, \nson of Queen Tomyris . \nWhen the queen learned what had happened, she sent a message to \nCyrus, chi ding him for using tricks to defeat her army. \"Now listen to me,\" \nshe wrote, \"and I will advise you for YOUf own good: Give me back my son \nand leave my country with YOUf forces intact, and be content with yoUf tri­\numph over a third part of the Massagetai. If you refuse, I swear by the sun \nour master to give you more blood than you can drink, for all your glut­\ntony. \" Cyrus scoff ed at her: He would not release her son.

Finally, the Massagetai preva iled. In \ntheir anger they decimated the Persian army, killing Cyrus himself. \nAfter the battle, Tomyris and her soldiers searched the battl efield for \nCyrus's corpse. When she found it she cut off his head and shoved it into a \nwineskin full of human blood, crying out, \"Though I have conquered you \nand live, yet you have ruined me by treacherously taking my son. See \nnow-I fulfill my threat: You have your fill of blood.\" After Cyrus's death, \nthe Persian Empire quickly unrave led. One act of arrogance undid all of \nCyru s's good work. \nInterpretat ion \nThere is nothing more intoxicating than victory, and nothing more dan­\ngerous. \nCyrus had built his great empire on the ruins of a previous one. A hun­\ndred years earlier, the powerful Assyrian Empire had been totally de­\nstroyed, its once splendid capital of Nineveh but ruins in the sand. The \nAssyrians had suff ered this fate because they had pushed too far, destroy­\ning one city-state after another until they lost sight of the purposes of their \nvictor ies, and also of the costs. They overextended themselves and made \nmany enemies who were finally able to band together and destroy them. \nCyrus ignored the lesson of Assyria. He paid no heed to the warnings \nof oracles and advisers. He did not worry about offending a queen. His \nmany victories had gone to his head, clouding his reason. Instead of con­\nsolidating his already vast empire, he pushed forward. Instead of recog niz­\ning each situation as different, he thought each new war would bring the \nsame result as the one before as long as he used the methods he knew: \nruthless force and cunning. \nUnderstand : In the re alm of power, you must be guided by reason. To \nlet a momentary thrill or an emotional victory influence or guide yOUf \nmoves will prove fatal. When you attain success, step back. Be cautious. \nWhen you gain victory, und erstand the part played by the particular cir­\ncumstances of a situa tion, and never simply repeat the same actions again \nand again. History is littered with the ruins of victorious empires and the \ncorpses of leaders who could not learn to stop and consolida te their gains. \nOBSER VANCE OF THE LAW \nNo single person in history has occupied a more delicate and precarious \nposition than the king's mistress. She had no real or legitimate power base \nto fall back on in times of trouble; she was sUITounded by packs of envious \ncourtiers eagerly anticipating her fall from gra ce; and finally, since the \nsource of her power was usually her physical beauty, for most royal mis­\ntresses that fall was inevitable and unpleasant. \nKing Louis XV of France began to keep official mistre sses in the early \ndays of his reign, each woman's good fortune rarely lasting more than a \nfew years. But then came Madame de Pompadour, who, when she was a \nmiddle-elass child of nine named Jeanne Poisson, had been told by a for­\ntune-teller that she would someday be the king's favorite . This seemed an \nabsurd dream, since the royal mistress almost always came from the aris­\ntocracy. Jeanne nevertheless believed herself destined to seduce the king, \nand doing so became her obsession. She applied herself to the talents the \nking's favorite had to have-- music, dancing, acting, horseba ck riding­\nand she excelled in every one of them. As a young woman, she married a \nman of the lower nobility, which gave her an entree to the best salons in \nParis. Word quickly spread of her beauty, talent, charm, and intellig ence. \nJeanne Poisson became elose friends with Voltaire, Montesquieu, and \nother great minds of the time, but she never lost sight of the goal she had \nset herself as a girl: to capture the heart of the king. Her husband had a \nchäteau in a forest where the king would often go hunting, and she began \nto spend a lot of time there. Studying his movements like a hawk, she \nwould make sure he would \"happen\" to come upon her while she was out \nwalking in her most alluring dress, or riding in her splendid coach. The \nking began to take note of her, making her gifts of the game he caught in \nthe hunt. \nIn 1744 Louis's current mistress, the Duchesse de Chäteauroux, died. \nJeanne went on the offensi ve. She placed herself everywhere he would be: \nat masked balls at Versailles, at the opera, wherever their paths would \ncross, and wherever she could display her many talents: dancing, singing, \nriding, coque try. The king finally succumbed to her charms, and in a cere­\nmony at Versaill es in September of 1745, this twenty-f our-year-old daugh­\nter of a midd le-elass banking agent was officially inaugurated as the king's \nmistre ss. She was given her own room in the palace, a room the king could \nenter at any time via a hidden stairway and back door. And because some \nof the courtiers were angry that he had chosen a woman of low origins, he \nmade her a marqui se. From now on she would be known as Madame de \nPompadour. \nThe king was a man whom the slightest feeling of boredom would op­\npress out of proportion. Madame de Pomp adour knew that keeping hirn \nunder her spell meant keeping hirn amu sed. To that end she put on con­\nstant theatrical productions at Versaill es, in which she starred. She orga­\nnized elaborate hunting parties, masked balls, and whatever else it would \ntake to keep hirn diverted outside the bedroom. She became a patron ess of \nthe arts, and the arbiter of taste and fashion for all of France. Her enemies \nat the court only grew in number with each new success, but Madame de \nPompadour thwarted them in a totally novel way for a king's mistre ss: with \nextreme polit eness.

Her sway was feIt even in \npolitics: Indeed she beca me the untitl ed minister of foreign affai rs. \nIn 1751, when Madame de Pompadour was at the height of her power, \nshe exp erienced her worst crisis. Physically weak ened by the responsibili­\nties of her position, she found it increasingly difficuIt to meet the king's de­\nmands in bed. This was usually the point at which the mistress would meet \nher end, strugg ling to maintain her position as her bea uty faded. But \nMadame de Pompadour had a strategy : She encouraged the king to set up \na kind of brot hel, Parc aux Cerfs, on the grounds of Versai lles. There the \nmiddle -aged king could have liaisons with the most beautiful young girls in \nthe realm. \nMadame de Pompa dour knew that her charm and her political acu­\nmen had made her indispensable to the king. What did she have to fear \nfrom a sixteen-yea r-old who had none of her power and presence? What \ndid it matter if she lost her position in the bedroom, as long as she re­\nmained the most powerful woman in France? To secure that position she \nbecame still closer friends with the queen, with whom she started attending \nchurch . Although her enemies at the court conspired to have her toppled \nfrom her official position as king's mist ress, the king kept her on, for he \nneeded her calming effe ct. It was only when her part in the disastrous \nSeven Years' War drew much criticism on her that she slowly withdrew \nfrom public affa irs. \nMadame de Pomp adour's health had always been delicate, and she \ndied at the age of forty -three, in 1764. Her reign as mistress had lasted an \nunprecedented twenty year s. \"She was regretted by all,\" wrote the Duc de \nCroy, \"for she was kindly and helpful to everyone who approach ed her.\" \nInterpretation \nAware of the temporarin ess of her power, the king's mistress would often \ngo into a kind of frenzy after capturing the king: She would try to accumu­\nlate as much money as possible to protect her after her inevitab le fall. And \nto extend her reign as long as possible, she would be ruthless with her ene­\nmies in the court. Her situation, in other words, seemed to demand from \nher a greed and vindictiveness that would often be her undoing. Madame \nde Pompadour succeeded where all others had failed because she never \npressed her good fortune. Instead of bullying the courtiers from her power­\nful position as the king' s mistress, she tried to win their support. She never \nrevealed the slightest hint of greed or arroga nce. When she could no \nlonger perform her physical duties as mistress, she did not fret at the \nthought of someone replacing her in bed. She simply applied some strat­\negy-she encouraged the king to take young lovers, knowing that the \nyounger and prettier they were, the less of a threat they posed, since they \ncould not compare to her in charm and sophistication and would so on \nbore the monarch . \nSuccess plays strange tricks on the mind. It makes you feel invulnera­\nble, while also making you more hostile and emotional when people chal -\nlenge your power. It makes you less able to adapt to circumsta nce. You \ncome to believe your character is more responsible for your success than \nyour strategizing and planning. Like Madame de Pompadour, you need to \nrealize that your moment of triumph is also a moment when you have to \nrely on cunning and strategy all the more, consolidating your power base, \nrecognizing the role of luck and circumstance in your success, and remain­\ning vigilant against changes in your good fortune . It is the moment of vic­\ntory when you need to play the courtier's game and pay more attention \nthan ever to the laws of power. \nThe g;reates t danger occurs at the moment 0/ victory. \nNapoleon Bona parte, 1769-18 21 \nKEYS TO POWER \nPower has its own rhythms and patterns. Those who succeed at the game \nare the ones who control the patterns and vary them at will, keeping peo­\npIe off balance while they set the tem po. The essence of strategy is control­\nling what comes next, and the elation of victory can upset your ability to \ncontrol what comes next in two ways. First, you owe your success to a pat­\ntern that you are apt to try to repeat. You will try to keep moving in the \nsame direction without stopping to see whether this is still the direction that \nis best for you. Second, success tends to go to your head and make you \nemotional. Feeling invulnera ble, you make aggressive moves that ulti­\nmately undo the victory you have gain ed. \nThe lesson is simple : The powernd vary their rhythms and patt erns, \nchange course, adapt to circumstanc e, and leam to improv ise. Rather than \nletting their dancing feet impel them forward, they step back and look \nwhere they are going. It is as if their bloo dstream bore a kind of antidote to \nthe intoxication of victory, letting them control their emotions and come to \na kind of mental halt when they have attained success. They steady them­\nselves, give themselves the space to reflect on what has happened, examine \nthe role of circumstance and luck in their success. As they say in riding \nschool, you have to be able to control yourself before you can control the \nhorse. \nLuck and circumstance always play a role in power. This is inevita ble, \nand actually makes the game more interesting. But despite what you may \nthink, good luck is more dangerous than bad luck. Bad luck teaches valu­\nable lessons about pat ience, timing, and the need to be prepared for the \nworst; good luck deludes you into the opposite lesson, making you think \nyour brillliance will carry you through. Your fortune will inevitably turn, \nand when it does you will be completely unprep ared. \nAccording to Machiavelli, this is what undid Cesare Borgia. He had \nmany triumphs, was actually a clever strategist, but had the bad luck to \nhave good luck : He had a pope for a father. Then, when he had bad luck \nfor real-his father's death-he was unprepared for it, and the many ene-\nLAW 47 415 \n416 LAW 47 mies he had made devoured him. The good luck that elevates you or seals \nyour success brings the moment for you to open your eyes: The wheel of \nfortune will hurtle you down as easily as up. If you prepare for the fall, it is \nless likely to ruin you when it happ ens. \nPeople who have a run of success can catch a kind of fever, and even \nwhen they themselves try to stay calm, the people below them often pres­\nsure them to go past their mark and into dangero us wate rs. You have to \nhave a strategy for dealing with these people. Simply pre aching modera­\ntion will make you look weak and small-min ded; seeming to fail to follow \nup on a victory can lessen your power. \nWhen the Athenian general and statesman Pericles led aseries of \nnaval campaigns around the Black Sea in 436 B.C., his easy triumphs en­\nflamed the Athenians' desire for more. They dreamed of conquering \nEgypt, overrunning Persia, sailing for Sicily. On the one hand Peri cles \nreined in these dangerous emotions by warning of the perils of hubr is. On \nthe other hand he fed them by fighting small battl es that he knew he could \nwin, creating the appearance that he was preserving the momentum of suc­\ncess. The skill with which Pericl es played this game is revealed by what \nhappened when he died: The dema gogues took over, pushed Ath ens into \ninvading Sicily, and in one rash move destroyed an empire. \nThe rhythm of power often requires an alternation of force and cun­\nning. Too much force creates a counterreact ion; too much cunning, no \nmatter how cunning it is, becomes predicta ble. Wo rking on behalf of his \nmaster, the shogun Oda Nobunaga, the great sixteenth-century Japanese \ngeneral (and future emperor) Hideyoshi once engin eered a stunning vic­\ntory over the army of the formida ble General Yoshimoto. The shogun \nwanted to go further, to take on and crush yet another powerful enemy, but \nHideyoshi reminded him of the old Jap anese saying: \"When you have \nwon a victory, tighten the strings of your helmet.\" For Hideyoshi this was \nthe moment for the shogun to switch from force to cunning and indirec­\ntion, setting his enemies agai nst one another through aseries of deceptive \nalliances. In this way he would avoid stirring up needless opposition by \nappearing overly aggre ssive. When you are victorious, then, lie low, and \nlull the enemy into inaction. These changes of rhythm are immensely \npowerful. \nPeople who go past the mark are often motivated by adesire to please \na master by proving their dedication. But an excess of effort exposes you to \nthe risk of making the master suspicious of you. On several occasions, gen­\nerals under Philip of Macedon were disgr aced and demoted immediately \nafter leading their troops to a great victory; one more such victory, Philip \nthought, and the man might become a riyal instead of an underling. When \nyou serve a master, it is often wise to measure your victories carefully, let­\nting him get the glory and never making him uneasy. It is also wise to es­\ntablish a pattern of strict obedience to earn his trust. In the fourth cent ury \nB.C., a captain under the notoriously severe Chinese general Wu Ch'i \ncharge d ahead before a battle had begun and came back with several \nenemy heads. He thought he had shown his fiery enthusiasm, but Wu Ch'i \nwas unimpressed. \"A talented officer,\" the general said with a sigh as he or­\ndered the man beheaded, \"but a disobedient one.\" \nAnother moment when a small success can spoil the chances for a \nlarger one may come if a master or superior grants you a favor: It is a dan­\ngerous mistake to ask for more. You will seem insecure-perhaps you feel \nyou did not deserve this favor, and have to grab as much as you can when \nyou have the chanc e, which may not come again. The proper response is \nto accept the favor grac iously and withdra w. Any subsequent favors you \nshould eam without having to ask for them. \nFinally, the moment when you stop has great dramatic import. What \ncomes last sticks in the mind as a kind of exclamation point. There is no \nbetter time to stop and walk away than after a victory. Keep going and you \nrisk lessening the effect, even ending up defea ted. As lawyers say of cross­\nexaminat ion, ''Always stop with a victory. \" \nImage: Icarus Falling \nfrom the Sky. His father \nDaedalus fashions wings \nof wax that allow the \ntwo men to fly out of \nthe labyrinth and \nescape the Minotaur. \nElated by the tri­\numphant escape \nand the feeling of \nflight, Icarus soars \nhigher and high-\ner, until the sun \nmelts the wings \nand he hurtles \nto his death. \nAuthority: Princes and republics should content themselves with victory, \nfor when they aim at more, they generally lose. The use of insulting lan­\nguage toward an enemy arises from the insolence of victory, or from the \nfalse hope of victory, which latter misleads men as often in their actions \nas in their words; for when this false hope takes possession of the mind, \nit makes men go beyond the mark, and causes them to sacrifice a cer­\ntain good for an uncertain better. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1 527) \nLAW 47 417 \n418 LAW 47 REVERSAL \nAs Machiavelli says, either destroy a man or leave hirn alone entirely. In­\nflicting half punishment or mild injury will only create an enemy whose \nhitterness will grow with time , and who will take revenge . When you heat \nan enemy, then, make your victory complete. Crush hirn into nonexis­\ntence. In the moment of victory, you do not restrain yourself from crushing \nthe enemy you have defeated, hut rather from needlessly advan cing \naga inst others . Be merciless with your enemy, hut do not create new ene­\nmies hy overreaching. \nThere are some who hecome more cautious than ever after a victory, \nwhich they see as just giving them more possessions to worry ahout and \nprotect. Your caution after victory should never make you hesitate, or lose \nmomentum, hut rather act as a safeguard aga inst rash action. On the other \nhand, momentum as a phenomenon is greatly overrate d. You create your \nown successes, and if they follow one upon the other, it is your own doing. \nBelief in momentum will only make you emotional, less prone to act strate­\ngically, and more apt to repeat the same methods. Leave momentum for \nthose who have nothing hetter to rely upon. \nLAW \n48 \nASSU ME FO RM LESSNESS \nJUDGMENT \nBy taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open \nyourself to attack.

So they tumed to the sea, establishing colonies in Asia Minor, \nSicily, the Italian peninsula, even Africa. The city-state of Sparta, however, \nwas landlocked and surroun ded by mountain s. Lacking access to the \nMediterranean, the Spartans never became a se afar ing people; instead \nthey tumed on the cities around them, and, in aseries of brutal, violent \nconflicts lasting more than a hundred years, managed to conquer an im­\nmense area that would provide enough land for their citizens. This solution \nto their problem, however, brought a new, more formidable one: How \ncould they maintain and police their conquered territories ? The subordi­\nnate peoples they ruled now outnumbered them ten to one. Surely this \nhorde would take a horrible revenge on them. \nSparta's solution was to create a society dedicated to the art of war. \nSpartans would be toug her, stronger, and fiercer than their neighb ors. This \nwas the only way they could ensure their stability and survival. \nWhen a Spartan boy reached the age of seven, he was taken from his \nmother and placed in a military club where he was trained to fight and un­\nderwent the strictest discipli ne. The boys slept on beds of reeds; they were \nallotted only one outer garm ent to wear for an entire year. They studied \nnone of the arts; indeed, the Spartans banned music, and perrnitted only \nslaves to pract ice the crafts that were necessary to sustain them. The only \nskiIls the Spartans taught were those of warf are. Children seen as weaklings \nwere left to die in a cavem in the mounta ins. No system of money or trad­\ning was allowed in Sparta; acquired wealth, they believed, would sow self­\nishness and dissension, weakening their warrlor disciplin e. The only way a \nSpartan could eam a living was through agriculture, mostly on state -owned \nlands, which slaves, called helots, would work for hirn. \nThe Spartan s' sing le-mindedness allowed them to forge the most pow­\nerful infantry in the world. They marched in perf ect order and fought with \nincomparable bravery. Their tight-knit phalanxes could vanquish an army \nten times their size, as they proved in defeating the Persians at Thermopy­\nlae. A Spartan column on the march would strike terror in the enemy; it \nseemed to have no weakn esses. Yet although the Spartans proved them­\nselves mighty war riors , they had no interest in creating an empi re. They \nonly wanted to keep what they had already conquered and to defend it \nagainst invaders . Decades would pass without a single change in the system \nthat had succeeded so weIl in preserving Sparta's status quo. \nAt the same time that the Spartans were evolving their warlike culture, \nanother city-state was rising to equal promi nence: Athe ns. Unlike Sparta, \nAth ens had taken to the sea, not so much to create colonies as for purposes \nof trade. The Ath enians became great merchants ; their currency, the fa­\nmous \"owl coins,\" spread throughout the Mediterran ean. Unlike the rigid \nSpartan s, the Ath enians responded to every problem with con summate \ncreativity, adapting to the occasion and creating new social forms and new \narts at an incredible pace. Their society was in constant flux. And as their \npower grew, they carne to pose a threat to the defen se-minded Spartan s. \nIn 431 B.C., the war that had been brewing between Athens and Sparta \nfor so long finally erupted. It lasted twenty -seven years, but after many \ntwists of fortune, the Spartan war machine finally emerged victorious. The \nSpartans now commanded an empire, and this time they could not stay in \ntheir shell. If they gave up what they had gained, the beaten Athenians \nwould regroup and rise against them, and the long war would have been \nfought for naught. \nAfter the war, Athenian money poured into Sparta. The Spartans had \nbeen trained in warf are, not politics or economics; beca use they were so \nunaccustomed to it, wealth and its accompanying ways of life seduced and \noverwhelmed them. Spartan govemors were sent to rule what had been \nAth enian lands; far from horne, they succumbed to the worst forms of cor­\nrupt ion. Sparta had defeated Ath ens, but the fluid Athenian way of life was \nslowly breaking down its discipline and loosening its rigid order. And \nAthens, meanwhile, was adapting to losing its empire, managing to thrive \nas a cultural and economic center. \nConfused by a change in its status quo, Sparta grew weaker and \nweaker. Some thirty years after defeating Athens, it lost an important batde \nwith the city-state of Thebes. Almost ovemight, this once mighty nation \ncollapsed, never to recover. \nInterpretation \nIn the evolution of species, protective armor has almo st always spelled dis­\naster. Although there are a few exceptions, the shell most often becomes a \ndead end for the animal encased in it; it slows the creature down, making it \nhard for it to forage for food and making it a target for fast-moving preda­\ntors. Animals that take to the sea or sky, and that move swifdy and unpre­\ndictably, are infinitely more powerful and secure. \nIn facing a serious problem -controlling superior numbers-Sparta \nreacted like an animal that develops a shell to protect itself from the envi­\nronment. But like a turde, the Spartans sacrificed mobility for safety. They \nmanaged to preserve stability for thr ee hundred years, but at what cost? \nThey had no culture beyond warf are, no arts to relieve the tension, a con­\nstant anxiety about the status quo. While their neighbors took to the sea, \nleaming to adapt to a world of constant motion, the Spartans entombed \nthemselves in their own system. Victory would mean new lands to govem, \nwhich they did not want; defeat would mean the end of their military ma­\nchine, which they did not want, either. Only stasis allowed them to surv ive. \nBut nothing in the world can remain stable forever, and the shell or system \nyou evolve for your protection will someday prove your undoing. \nIn the case of Sparta, it was not the armies of Athens that defeated it, \nbut the Athenian money. Money flows everywhere it has the opportunity \nto go; it cannot be controlled, or made to fit a prescrib ed patte rn. It is in­\nherendy chaotic. And in the long run, money made Ath ens the conqueror, harharousl y cut \"Hhis \nlong pendent ears. \nJowler expected nuth­\ning less than to give up \nthe ghost. \nAs he advaneed in \nyears, he perceivcd that \nhe gained more than he \nhad lost hy his mutila­\ntion; for, being natu­\nrally inclined to fight \nwith others, he would \noften havc returned \nhome with this part \ndisfigured in a hundred \nplaces.

No predator \nalive can attack what it cannot see. \nOBSER VANCE OF THE LAW \nWhen World War 11 ended and the Japanese, who had invaded China \nin 1937, had finally been thrown out, the Chinese Nationalists, lead by \nChiang Kai-shek, decided the time had come to annihilate the Chinese \nCommunists, their hated rivals, once and for all. They had almost suc­\nceeded in 1935, forcing the Communists into the Long March, the grueling \nretreat that had greatly dirninished their numbers. Although the Commu­\nnists had recovered somewhat during the war against Japan, it would not \nbe difficult to defeat them now. They controlled only isolated areas in the \ncountryside, had unsophisticated weaponry, lacked any military experi­\nence or training beyond mountain fighting, and controlled no important \nparts of China, except areas of Manchuria, which they had managed to take \nafter the J apanese retreat. Chiang decided to commit his best forces in \nManchuria. He would take over its major cities and from those bases would \nspread through this northern industrial region, sweeping the Communists \naway. Once Manchuria had fallen the Communists would collapse. \nIn 1945 and '46 the plan worked perfect ly: The Nationalists easily \ntook the major Manchurian cities. Puzzlingly, though, in the face of this \ncritical campaign, the Communist strategy made no sense. When the Na­\ntionalists began their push, the Communists dispersed to Manchuria's most \nout-of-the-way corners. Their small units harassed the Nationalist arrnies, \nambushing them here, retreating unexpectedly there, but these dispersed \nunits never linked up, making them hard to attack. They would seize a \ntown only to give it up a few weeks later. Forming neither rear guards nor \nvanguards, they moved like mercury, never staying in one place, elusive \nand formless. \nThe Nationalists ascribed this to two things: cowardice in the face \nof superior forces and inexperience in strategy. Mao Tse-tung, the Com­\nmunist leader, was more a poet and philosopher than a general, whereas \nChiang had studied warf are in the West and was a folIower of the German \nmilitary writer Carl von Clausewitz, among others. \nYet a pattern did eventually emerge in Mao's attacks. After the Nation­\nalists had taken the cities, leaving the Communists to occupy what was gen­\nerally considered Manchuria's useless space, the Communists started using \nthat large space to surround the cities. If Chiang sent an army from one city \nto reinforce another, the Communists would encircle the rescuing army. \nChiang's forces were slowly broken into smaller and smaller units, isolated \nfrom one another, their lines of supply and communication cut. The Na­\ntionalists still had superior firepower, but if they could not move, what \ngood was it? \nA kind of terror overcame the Nationalist soldiers. Commanders com­\nfortably remote from the front lines might laugh at Mao, but the soldiers \nhad fought the Communists in the mounta ins, and had come to fear their \nelusiveness. Now these soldiers sat in their cities and watched as their fast­\nmoving enemies, as fluid as water, poured in on them from all sides. There \nseemed to be millions of them. The Communists also encircled the sol­\ndiers' spirits, bomba rding them with propaganda to lower their morale and \npressure them to desert. \nThe Nationalists began to surrender in their minds . Their encircled \nand isolated cities started collapsing even before being directly attacke d; \none after another fell in quick succession. In November of 1948, the Na­\ntionalists surrendered Manchuria to the Communists-a humiliating blow \nto the technically superior Nationalist army, and one that proved decisive \nin the war. By the following year the Communists controlled all of China. \nInterpretation \nThe two board games that best approximate the strategies of war are chess \nand the Asian game of go. In chess the board is smalI. In comparison to go, \nthe attack comes relatively quickly, forcing a decisive battle. It rarely pays \nto withdraw, or to sacrifice YOUf pieces, which must be concentrated at key \nareas. Go is much less formal. It is played on a large grid, with 361 inter­\nsections-nearly six times as many positions as in chess. Black and white \nstones (one color for each side) are placed on the board's interseetions, one \nat a time, wherever you like. Once all YOUf stones (52 for each side) are on \nthe board, the object is to isolate the stones of YOUf opponent by encircling \nthem. \nAgame of go-called wei-chi in China-can last up to three hundred \nmoves. The strategy is more subtle and fluid than chess, developing slowly; \nthe more complex the pattern your stones initially create on the board, the \nharder it is for YOUf opponent to understand your strategy. Fighting to con­\ntrol a particular area is not worth the trouble: You have to think in larger \nterms, to be prepared to sacrifice an area in order eventually to dominate \nthe board. What you are after is not an entrenched position but mobility. \nWith mobility you can isolate the opponent in small areas and then encir­\ncle them. The aim is not to kill off the opponent' s pieces directly, as in \nchess, but to induce a kind of paralysis and collapse.

A key \nwei-chi concept, for exa mple, is to use the size of the board to your advan­\ntage, spreading out in every direction so that your opponent cannot fathom \nyour movements in a simpl e linear way. \n\"Every Chine se,\" Mao once wrote, \"should consciously throw himself \ninto this war of a jigsaw pattern\" agai nst the Nationali sts. Place your men in \na jigsaw pattern in go, and your opponent loses himself trying to figure out \nwhat you are up to. Either he wastes time pursuing you or, like Chiang Kai­\nshek, he assumes you are incompetent and falls to protect himself. And if \nhe concentrates on single areas, as Western strategy advises, he becomes a \nsitting duck for encirclement. In the wei-chi way of war, you encircle the \nenemy's brain, using mind games, propaganda, and irritation tactics to \nconfuse and dishearten. This was the strategy of the Communists-an ap­\nparent form lessness that disoriented and terrified their enemy. \nWhere chess is linear and direct, the ancient game of go is closer to the \nkind of strategy that will prove relevant in a world where battles are fought \nindirectly, in vast, loosely connected areas. Its strategies are abstract and \nmultidimensional, inhabiting ap lane beyond time and space: the strate­\ngist's mind. In this fluid form of warf are, you value movement over posi­\ntion. Your speed and mobility make it impossible to predict your moves; \nuna ble to understand you, your enemy can form no strategy to defeat you. \nInstead of fixing on particular spots, this indirect form of warfare spreads \nout, just as you can use the large and disconnected nature of the real world \nto your advantage . Be like a vapor. Do not give your opponents anything \nsolid to attack; watch as they exhaust themselves pursuing you, trying to \ncope with your elusiveness. Only formlessness allows you to truly surprise \nyour enemies -by the time they figure out where you are and what you are \nup to, it is too late . \nWhen you want to fight us, we don 't let you and you can 't find uso But when \nwe want to fight you, we make sure that you can 't get away and we hit you \nsquarely , .. and wipe you out. , , . The enemy advanc es, we retreat; the enemy \ncamps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue. \nMao Tse-tung, 189 3-1 976 \nKEYS TO POWER \nThe human animal is distingui shed by its constant creation of forms. \nRarely expressing its emotions directly, it gives them form through lan­\nguage , or through socially acceptable ritu als. We cannot communicate our \nemotions without a form. \nThe forms that we create, however, change con stantly-in fashion, in \nstyle, in all those human phenomena representing the mood of the mo­\nment. We are constantly altering the forms we have inherited from previ­\nous generati ons, and these changes are signs of life and vitality. Indeed, the \nthings that don 't change, the forms that rigidify, come to look to us like \ndeath, and we destroy them. The young show this most clearly: Uncom­\nfortable with the forms that society imposes upon them, having no set iden­\ntity, they play with their own characters, trying on a variety of masks and \nposes to express themselves. This is the vitality that drives the motor of \nform, creating constant changes in style. \nThe powerful are often people who in their youth have shown im­\nmense creativity in expressing something new through a new form. Society \ngrants them power because it hungers for and rewards this sort of newness. \nThe problem comes later, when they often grow conservative and posses­\nsive. They no longer dream of creating new forms; their identities are set, \ntheir habits congeal, and their rigidity makes them easy targets. Everyone \nknows their next move. Instead of demanding respect they elicit boredom: \nGet off the stage! we say, let someone else, someone younger, entertain uso \nWhen locked in the past, the powerful look comical-they are overripe \nfruit, waiting to fall from the tree. \nPower can only thrive if it is flexible in its forms. To be formless is not \nto be amorphous; everything has a form-it is impossible to avoid. The \nformlessness of power is more like that of water, or mercury, taking the \nform of whatever is around it. Changing constantly, it is never predictab le. \nThe powerful are constantly creating form, and their power comes from \nthe rapidity with which they can change. Their formlessness is in the eye of \nthe enemy who cannot see what they are up to and so has nothing solid to \nattack. This is the premier pose of power: ungraspable, as elusive and swift \nas the god Mercury, who could take any form he pleased and used this \nability to wreak havoc on Mount Olympu s. \nHuman creations evolve toward abstraction, toward being more men­\ntal and less material. This evolution is clear in art, which, in this century, \nmade the great discovery of abstraction and concept ualism; it can also be \nseen in politics, which over time have become less overtly violent, more \ncomplicated, indirect and cerebral. Warfare and strategy too have followed \nthis pattern. Strategy began in the manipulation of armies on land, posi­\ntioning them in ordered formations; on land, strategy is relatively two di­\nmensional, and controlled by topography. But all the great powers have \neventually taken to the sea, for commerce and colonization. And to protect \ntheir trading lanes they have had to leam how to fight at sea. Maritime war­\nfare requires tremendous creativity and abstract thinking, since the lines \nare constantly shifting. Naval captains distinguish themselves by their abil­\nity to adapt to the literal fluidity of the terrain and to confuse the enemy \nwith an abstract, hard-to-anticipate form. They are operating in a third di­\nmension: the mind. \nBack on land, guerrilla warfare too demonstrates this evolution toward \nabstraction. T. E. Lawrence was perhaps the first modem strategist to de-CII\\H.\\( ''!'I'.11 \\1l\\JOH \nTo carry out the \ninstinctual inhibition \ndemanded by the \nmodern world and tu \nbe able to cope with the \nenergy stasis which \nresults from this inhibi­\ntion. the ego has to \nundergo a change. The \nego. i.e .• that part of \nthe person that is \nexposed to danger, \nbecomes rigid, as we \nsay, when it is continu­\nally subjected to the \nsame or similar \nconflicts between need \nand a fear-inducing \nouter world. It acquires \nin this process a \nchronic, automaticallv \nfunetioning mode of \nreaction, i.e., its \"char­\naeter.\" It is as if the \naffective personality \narmored itself, as if the \nhard shell it develops \nwere intended to defleet \nand weaken the blows \nof the outer world as \nweil as the clamoring \nof the inner needs. This \narmoring makes the \nperson less sensitive to \nunp1easure, but also \nrestricts his libidinal \nand aggressive motility \nand thus reduees his \ncapa city for achieve­\nment ami pleasure. We \nsay the ego has become \nless flexible and more \nrigid, and that the abil­\nity to regulate the \nenergyeconomy \ndepends on the extent \nofthe armoring. \nWII.HFLM REICH, \n1897- 1957 \nLAW 48 425 \n426 LAW 48 velop the theory behind this kind of warf are, and to put it into practice. His \nideas influenced Mao, who found in his writings an uncanny Western \nequivalent to wei-chi. Lawrence was working with Arabs fighting for their \nterritory against the Turks. His idea was to make the Arabs blend into the \nvast desert, never providing a target, never collecting together in one place. \nAs the Turks scrambled to fight this vaporous army, they spread them­\nselves thin, wasting energy in moving from place to place. They had the su­\nperior firepower but the Arabs kept the initiative by playing cat and \nmouse, giving the Turks nothing to hold on to, destroying their morale. \n\"Most wars were wars of contact. ... Ours should be a war of detac hment,\" \nLawrence wrote . \"We were to contain the enemy by the silent threat of a \nvast unknown desert, not disdosing ourselves till we attac ked.\" \nThis is the ultimate form of strategy. The war of engagement has be­\ncome far too dangerous and costly ; indirection and elusiveness yield far \nbetter results at a much lower cost. The main cost, in fa ct, is mental-the \nthinking it takes to align your forces in scattered patt erns, and to under­\nmine the minds and psychology of your opponents . And nothing will infu­\nriate and disorient them more than formlessness. In a world where wars of \ndetachment are the order of the day, form lessness is crucial. \nThe first psychological requirement of form lessness is to train yourself \nto take nothing perso nally. Never show any defen siveness. When you act \ndefensive, you show your emotions, revealing a dear form. Your oppo­\nnents will realize they have hit a nerve, an Achilles' heel. And they will hit \nit again and again . So train yourself to take nothing person ally. Never let \nany one get your back up. Be like a slippery ball that cannot be held: Let no \none know what gets to you, or where your weakne sses lie. Make your face \na formless mask and you will infuriate and disorient your scheming col­\nleagues and opponents. \nOne man who used this technique was Baron J ames Rothschild. A \nGerman Jew in Paris, in a culture decidedly unfriendly to foreigners, Roth­\nschild never took any attack on hirn personally or showed he had been \nhurt in any way. He furthermore adapted hirnself to the political dimate, \nwhatever it was-the stiffly formal Restoration monarchy of Louis XVIII, \nthe bourgeois reign of Louis- Phili ppe, the democratic revolution of 1848, \nthe upstart Louis-Na poleon crowned emperor in 1852. Rothschild ac­\ncepted them one and all, and blended in. He could afford to appear hypo­\ncritical or opportunistic because he was valued for his money, not his \npolitics; his money was the currency of power. While he adapted and \nthrived, outwardly never showing a form, all the other great fam ilies that \nhad begun the century immensely wealthy were ruin ed in the period's \ncomplicated shifts and turns of fortun e. Atta ching themselves to the past, \nthey revealed their embrace of a form. \nThroughout history, the formless style of ruling has been most adeptly \npracticed by the queen who reigns alone. A queen is in a radically diff erent \nposition from a king; because she is a woman, her subj ects and courtiers \nare likely to doubt her ability to rule, her strength of character. If she favors \none side in some ideological struggle, she is said to be acting out of emo­\ntional attachm ent. Yet if she represses her emotions and plays the authori­\ntarian, in the male fashion, she arouses worse criticism still. Either by \nnature or by experience, then, queens tend to adopt a flexible style of gov­\nerning that in the end often proves more powerful than the more direct, \nmale form. \nTwo female leaders exemplifying the formless style of rule are Queen \nElizabeth of England and Empress Catherine the Great of Russia. In the vi­\nolent wars between Catholics and Protestants, Elizabeth steered am iddIe \ncourse. She avoided allia nces that would commit her to one side, and that \nover time would harm the country. She managed to keep her country at \npeace until it was strong enough for war. Her reign was one of the most glo­\nrious in his tory because of her incredible capacity to adapt and her flexible \nideolog y. \nCatherine the Great too evolved an improvisatory style of governing. \nMter she deposed her husband, Emperor Peter II, taking sole control of \nRussia in 1762, no one thought she would survi ve. But she had no precon­\nceived ideas, no philosophy or theory to dictate her policies. Although a \nforeigner (she came from Germa ny), she understood Russia's moods, and \nhow it was changing over the years. \"One must govern in such a way that \none's people think they themselves want to do what one commands them \nto do,\" she said, and to do this she had to be always a step ahead of their \ndesires and to adapt to their resista nce. By never forcing the issue, she re­\nformed Russia in a strikingly short period of time . \nThis feminin e, formless style of ruling may have emerged as a way of \nprospering under difficult circumsta nces, but it has proved immensely se­\nductive to those who have served under it. Being fluid, it is relatively easy \nfor its subjects to obey, for they feel less coerced, less bent to their ruler's \nideology. It also opens up options where an adherence to a doctrine closes \nthem off. Without committing to one side, it allows the ruler to play one \nenemy off another. Rigid rulers may seem strong, but with time their in­\nflexibility wears on the nerves, and their subjects find ways to push them \nfrom the sta ge. Flexib le, formless rulers will be much criticized, but they \nwill endure, and people will event ually come to identify with them, since \nthey are as their subj ects are-changing with the wind, open to circum­\nstance. \nDespite upsets and delays, the permeable style of power generally tri­\numphs in the end, just as Athens eventually won victory over Sparta \nthrough its money and its culture. When you find yourself in conflict with \nsomeone stronger and more rigid, allow them a momentary victory. Seem \nto bow to their superio rity. Then, by being formless and adapta ble, slowly \ninsinuate yourself into their soul. This way you will catch them off guard, \nfor rigid people are always ready to ward off direct blows but are helpless \naga inst the subtle and insinuating. To succeed at such a strategy you must \nplay the cham eleo n-conform on the surfac e, while breaking down your \nenemy from the inside . \nLAW 48 427 \n428 LAW 48 For centuries the Japanese would accept foreigners graciously, and ap­\npeared susceptible to foreign cultures and influen ces. Joao Rodriguez, a \nPortuguese priest who arrived in Japan in 1577 and lived there far many \nyears, wrote, \"I am flabbergasted by the Japane se willingness to try and ac­\ncept everything Portuguese.\" He saw Japanese in the streets wearing Por­\ntuguese clothing, with rosary beads at their necks and crosses at their hips. \nThis might seem like a weak, mutable culture, but Japan's adaptability \nactually protected the country from having an alien culture imposed by \nmilitary invasion. It seduced the Portuguese and other Westemers into be­\nlieving the Japanese were yielding to a superior culture when actually the \nforeign culture's ways were merely a fashion to be donned and doffed. \nUnder the surface, Japanese culture thrived. Had the Japanese been rigid \nabout foreign influences and tried to fight them off, they might have suf ­\nfered the injuries that the West inflicted on China. That is the power of \nformlessness--it gives the aggressor nothing to react against, nothing to hit. \nIn evolution, largeness is often the first step toward extinct ion. What is \nimmense and bloated has no mobility, but must constantly feed itself. The \nunintelligent are often seduced into believing that size connotes power, the \nbigger the better. \nIn 483 B.C., King Xerxes of Persia invaded Greece, believing he could \nconquer the country in one easy campaign . After all, he had the largest \narmy ever assembled for one invasion-the historian Herodotus estimated \nit at over more than five million. The Persians planned to build a bridge \nacross the Hellespont to overrun Greece from the land, while their equally \nimmense navy would pin the Greek ships in harbor, preventing their \nforces from escaping to sea. The plan seemed sure, yet as Xerxes prepared \nthe invasion, his adviser Artabanus wamed his master of grave misgivin gs: \n\"The two mightiest powers in the world are against you,\" he said. Xerxes \nlaughed-what powers could match his gigantic army? \"I will tell you what \nthey are,\" answered Artabanus. \"The land and the sea.\" There were no safe \nharbors large enough to receive Xerxes' fleet. And the more land the Per­\nsians conquered, and the longer their supply lines stretched, the more ru­\ninous the cost of feeding this immense army would prove. \nThinking his adviser a coward, Xerxes proceeded with the invasion. \nYet as Artabanus predict ed, bad weather at sea decimated the Persian fleet, \nwhich was too large to take shelter in any harbor. On land, meanwhi le, the \nPersian army destroyed everything in its path, which only made it impossi­\nble to feed, since the destruction included crops and stores of food. It was \nalso an easy and slow-moving target. The Greeks practiced all kinds of de­\nceptive maneuvers to disorient the Persians. Xerxes' eventual defeat at the \nhands of the Greek allies was an immense disaster. The story is emblematic \nof all those who sacrifice mobility for size: The flexible and fleet of foot will \nalmost always win, for they have more strategie options. The more gigantic \nthe enemy, the easier it is to induce collapse. \nThe need for formlessness becomes greater the older we get, as we \ngrow more likely to become set in our ways and assume too rigid a form. \nWe become predicta ble, always the first sign of decrepitude. And pre­\ndictability makes us appear comica1. Although ridicule and disdain might \nseem mild forms of attack, they are actually potent weapons, and will even­\ntually erode a foundation of power. An enemy who does not respect you \nwill grow bold, and boldness makes even the smallest animal danger ous. \nThe late-eighteenth-century court of France, as exemplified by Marie­\nAntoinette, had become so hopelessly tied to a rigid formality that the \naverage Frenchman thought it a silly relic. This deprecia tion of a centuries­\nold institution was the first sign of a terminal disease, for it represented a \nsymbolic loosening of the people's ties to monarchy. As the situation wors­\nened, Marie-Antoinette and King Louis XVI grew only more rigid in their \nadherence to the past-and quickened their path to the guillotine. King \nCharles I of England reacted similarly to the tide of democratic change \nbrewing in England in the 1630s: He disbanded Parliament, and his court \nrituals grew increasingly formal and distant. He wanted to return to an \nolder style of ruling, with adherence to all kinds of petty protoco1. His \nrigidity only heighten ed the desire for change. So on, of course, he was \nswept up in a devastating civil war, and eventually he lost his head to the \nexecutio ner's axe. \nAs you get older, you must rely even less on the past. Be vigilant lest \nthe form your character has taken makes you seem a relic. It is not a matter \nof mimicking the fashions of youth-that is equally worthy of laughter. \nRather your mind must constantly adapt to each circumsta nce, even the in­\nevitable change that the time has come to move over and let those of \nyounger age prepare for their ascendancy. Rigidity will only make you \nlook uncannily like a cadaver. \nNever forget, though, that formlessness is a strategie pose. It gives you \nroom to create tactical surprises; as your enemies struggle to guess your \nnext move, they reveal their own strategy, putting them at a decided disad­\nvantage. It keeps the initiative on your side, putting your enemies in the \nposition of never acting, constantly reacting. It foils their spying and intelli­\ngence. Remember: Formle ssness is a too1. Never confuse it with a go-with­\nthe-flow style, or with a religious resignation to the twists of fortune. You \nuse formlessness, not because it creates inner harmony and peace, but be­\ncause it will increase your power. \nFinally, learning to adapt to each new circumstance me ans seeing \nevents through your own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that people \nconstantly peddle your way. It means that ultimately you must throw out \nthe laws that others preach, and the books they write to tell you what to do, \nand the sage advice of the eIder. \"The laws that govern circum stances are \nabolished by new circumsta nces,\" Napoleon wrote, which means that it is \nup to you to gauge each new situation. Rely too much on other people's \nideas and you end up taking a form not of your own making. Too much re­\nspect for other people's wisdom will make you depreciate your own. Be \nbrutal with the past, especially your own, and have no respect for the \nphilosoph ies that are foisted on you from outside. \nLAW 48 429 \n430 LAW 48 Image: Mercury.

That is how Mao succeeded \nagainst the NationaHsts: He broke their forces into small, isolated units, \nwhich he then could easily overwhelm with a strong attack. The law of con­\ncentration prevail ed. \nWhen you play with formlessness, keep on top of the process, and \nkeep your long-term strategy in mind.
