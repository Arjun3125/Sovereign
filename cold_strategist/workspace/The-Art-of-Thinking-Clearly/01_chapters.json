I had never\nconsidered myself an ‘intellectual’ – I had studied business, which made me quite\nthe opposite, really – but I had also written two literary novels and that, I guessed,\nmust have qualified me for such an invitation.\nNassim Nicholas Taleb was sitting at the table. At that time, he was an obscure\nWall Street trader with a penchant for philosophy. I was introduced to him as an\nauthority on the English and Scottish Enlightenment, particularly the philosophy\nof David Hume. Obviously I had been mixed up with someone else. Stunned, I\nnevertheless ﬂashed a hesitant smile around the room and let the resulting\nsilence act as proof of my philosophical prowess. Straight away, Taleb pulled\nover a free chair and patted the seat. I sat down. After a cursory exchange about\nHume, the conversation mercifully shifted to Wall Street. We marveled at the\nsystematic errors in decision making that CEOs and business leaders make –\nourselves included. We chatted about the fact that unexpected events seem much\nmore likely in retrospect. We chuckled about why it is that investors cannot part\nwith their shares when they drop below acquisition price.\nFollowing the event, Taleb sent me pages from his manuscript, a gem of a\nbook, which I commented on and partly criticised. These went on to form part of\nhis international best-seller, \nThe Black Swan\n. The book catapulted Taleb into the\nintellectual all-star league. Meanwhile, my appetite whetted, I began to devour\nbooks and articles written by cognitive and social scientists on topics such as\n‘heuristics and biases’, and I also increased my email conversations with a large\nnumber of researchers and started to visit their labs. By 2009, I had"

      "chapter_text": " realised that,\nalongside my job as a novelist, I had become a student of social and cognitive\npsychology.\nThe failure to think clearly, or what experts call a ‘cognitive error’, is a\nsystematic deviation from logic – from optimal, rational, reasonable thought and\nbehaviour. By ‘systematic’ I mean that these are not just occasional errors in\njudgement, but rather routine mistakes, barriers to logic we stumble over time and\nagain, repeating patterns through generations and through the centuries. For\nexample, it is much more common that we overestimate our knowledge than that\nwe underestimate it. Similarly, the danger of losing something stimulates us much\nmore than the prospect of making a similar gain. In the presence of other people\nwe tend to adjust our behaviour to theirs, not the opposite. Anecdotes make us\noverlook the statistical distribution (base rate) behind it, not the other way round.\nThe errors we make follow the same pattern over and over again, piling up in one\nspeciﬁc, predictable corner like dirty laundry while the other corner remains\nrelatively clean (i.e. they pile up in the ‘overconﬁdence corner’, not the\n‘underconfidence corner’).\nTo avoid frivolous gambles with the wealth I had accumulated over the course\nof my literary career, I began to put together a list of these systematic cognitive\nerrors, complete with notes and personal anecdotes – with no intention of ever\npublishing them. The list was originally designed to be used by me alone. Some\nof these thinking errors have been known for centuries; others have been\ndiscovered in the last few years. Some come with two or three names attached to\nthem. I chose the terms most widely used. Soon I realised that such a compilation\nof pitfalls was not only useful for making investing decisions, but also for business\nand personal matters. Once I had prepared the list, I felt calmer and more\nclearheaded. I began to recognise my own errors sooner and was able to change\ncourse before any lasting damage was done. And, for the ﬁrst time in my life, I\nwas able to recognise when others might be in thrall to these very same\nsystematic errors. Armed with my list, I could now resist their pull – and perhaps\neven gain an upper hand in my dealings. I now had categories, terms, and\nexplanations with which to ward off the spectre of irrationality. Since Benjamin\nFranklin’s kite-ﬂying days, thunder and lightning have not grown less frequent,\npowerful or loud – but they have become less worrisome. This is exactly how I\nfeel about my own irrationality now.\nFriends soon learned of my compendium and showed interest. This led to a\nweekly newspaper column in Germany, Holland and Switzerland, countless\npresentations (mostly to medical doctors, investors, board members, CEOs and\ngovernment officials) and eventually to this book.\nPlease keep in mind three things as you peruse these pages: ﬁrst, the list of\nfallacies in this book is not complete. Undoubtedly new ones will be discovered.\nSecond, the majority of these errors are related to one another. This should come\nas no surprise. After all, all brain regions are linked. Neural projections travel from\nregion to region in the brain; no area functions independently. Third, I am\nprimarily a novelist and an entrepreneur, not a social scientist; I don’t have my\nown lab where I can conduct experiments on cognitive errors, nor do I have a staff\nof researchers I can dispatch to scout for behavioural errors. In writing this book, I\nthink of myself as a translator whose job is to interpret and synthesise what I’ve\nread and learned – to put it in terms others can understand. My great respect goes\nto the researchers who, in recent decades, have uncovered these behavioural\nand cognitive errors. The success of this book is fundamentally a tribute to their\nresearch. I am enormously indebted to them.\nThis is not a how-to book. You won’t ﬁnd ‘seven steps to an error-free life’ here.\nCognitive errors are far too ingrained for us to be able to rid ourselves of them\ncompletely. Silencing them would require superhuman willpower, but that isn’t\neven a worthy goal. Not all cognitive errors are toxic, and some are even\nnecessary for leading a good life. Although this book may not hold the key to\nhappiness, at the very least it acts as insurance against too much self-induced\nunhappiness.\nIndeed, my wish is quite simple: if we could learn to recognise and evade the\nbiggest errors in thinking – in our private lives, at work or in government – we\nmight experience a leap in prosperity. We need no extra cunning, no new ideas,\nno unnecessary gadgets, no frantic hyperactivity – all we need is less irrationality.\n1\nWHY YOU SHOULD VISIT CEMETERIES\nSurvivorship Bias\nNo matter where Rick looks, he sees rock stars. They appear on television, on the\nfront pages of magazines, in concert programmes and at online fan sites. Their\nsongs are unavoidable – in the mall, on his playlist, in the gym. The rock stars are\neverywhere. There are lots of them. And they are successful. Motivated by the\nstories of countless guitar heroes, Rick starts a band. Will he make it big? The\nprobability lies a fraction above zero. Like so many others, he will most likely end\nup in the graveyard of failed musicians. This burial ground houses 10,000 times\nmore musicians than the stage does, but no journalist is interested in failures –\nwith the exception of fallen superstars. This makes the cemetery invisible to\noutsiders.\nIn daily life, because triumph is made more visible than failure, you\nsystematically overestimate your chances of succeeding. As an outsider, you (like\nRick) succumb to an illusion, and you mistake how minuscule the probability of\nsuccess really is. Rick, like so many others, is a victim of \nSurvivorship Bias.\nBehind every popular author you can ﬁnd 100 other writers whose books will\nnever sell. Behind them are another 100 who haven’t found publishers. Behind\nthem are yet another 100 whose unﬁnished manuscripts gather dust in drawers.\nAnd behind each one of these are 100 people who dream of – one day – writing a\nbook. You, however, hear of only the successful authors (these days, many of\nthem self-published) and fail to recognise how unlikely literary success is. The\nsame goes for photographers, entrepreneurs, artists, athletes, architects, Nobel\nPrize winners, television presenters and beauty queens. The media is not\ninterested in digging around in the graveyards of the unsuccessful. Nor is this its\njob. To elude the \nsurvivorship bias\n, you must do the digging yourself.\nYou will also come across \nsurvivorship bias\n when dealing with money and risk:\nimagine that a friend founds a start-up. You belong to the circle of potential\ninvestors and you sense a real opportunity: this could be the next Google. Maybe\nyou’ll be lucky. But what is the reality? The most likely scenario is that the\ncompany will not even make it off the starting line. The second most likely\noutcome is that it will go bankrupt within three years. Of the companies that\nsurvive these ﬁrst three years, most never grow to more than ten employees. So,\nshould you never put your hard-earned money at risk? Not necessarily. But you\nshould recognise that the \nsurvivorship bias\n is at work, distorting the probability of\nsuccess like cut glass.\nTake the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index. It consists of out-and-out\nsurvivors. Failed and small businesses do not enter the stock market, and yet\nthese represent the majority of business ventures. A stock index is not indicative\nof a country’s economy. Similarly, the press does not report proportionately on all\nmusicians. The vast number of books and coaches dealing with success should\nalso make you sceptical: the unsuccessful don’t write books or give lectures on\ntheir failures.\nSurvivorship bias \ncan become especially pernicious when you become a\nmember of the ‘winning’ team. Even if your success stems from pure coincidence,\nyou’ll discover similarities with other winners and be tempted to mark these as\n‘success factors’. However, if you ever visit the graveyard of failed individuals and\ncompanies, you will realise that its tenants possessed many of the same traits\nthat characterise your success.\nIf enough scientists examine a particular phenomenon, a few of these studies\nwill deliver statistically signiﬁcant results through pure coincidence – for example\nthe relationship between red wine consumption and high life expectancy. Such\n(false) studies immediately attain a high degree of popularity "

      "chapter_text": "o-\nTreat Error\n (ch. 98)\n2\nDOES HARVARD MAKE YOU SMARTER?\nSwimmer’s Body Illusion\nAs essayist and trader Nassim Taleb resolved to do something about the\nstubborn extra pounds he’d be carrying, he contemplated taking up various\nsports. However, joggers seemed scrawny and unhappy, and bodybuilders\nlooked broad and stupid, and tennis players? Oh, so upper-middle class!\nSwimmers, though, appealed to him with their well-built, streamlined bodies. He\ndecided to sign up at his local swimming pool and to train hard twice a week.\nA short while later, he realised that he had succumbed to an illusion.\nProfessional swimmers don’t have perfect bodies because they train extensively.\nRather, they are good swimmers because of their physiques. How their bodies\nare designed is a factor for selection and not the result of their activities. Similarly,\nfemale models advertise cosmetics and thus, many female consumers believe\nthat these products make you beautiful. But it is not the cosmetics that make these\nwomen model-like. Quite simply, the models are born attractive and only for this\nreason are they candidates for cosmetics advertising. As with the swimmers’\nbodies, beauty is a factor for selection and not the result.\nWhenever we confuse selection factors with results, we fall prey to what Taleb\ncalls the \nswimmer’s body illusion\n. Without this illusion, half of advertising\ncampaigns would not work. But this bias has to do with more than just the pursuit\nof chiselled cheekbones and chests. For example, Harvard has the reputation of\nbeing a top university. Many highly successful people have studied there. Does\nthis mean that Harvard is a good school? We don’t know. Perhaps the school is\nterrible, and it simply recruits the brightest students around. I experienced this\nphenomenon at the University of St Gallen in Switzerland. It is said to be one of\nthe top ten business schools in Europe, but the lessons I received (although note\nthat this was twenty-ﬁve years ago) were mediocre. Nevertheless, many of its\ngraduates were successful. The reason behind this is unknown – perhaps it was\ndue to the climate in the narrow valley or even the cafeteria food. Most probable,\nhowever, is the rigorous selection.\nAll over the world, MBA schools lure candidates with statistics regarding future\nincome. This simple calculation is supposed to show that the horrendously high\ntuition fees pay for themselves after a short period of time. Many prospective\nstudents fall for this approach. I am not implying that the schools doctor the\nstatistics, but still their statements must not be swallowed wholesale. Why?\nBecause those who pursue an MBA are different from those who do not. The\nincome gap between these groups stems from a multitude of reasons that have\nnothing to do with the MBA degree itself. Once again we see the \nswimmer’s body\nillusion\n at work: the factor for selection confused with the result. So, if you are\nconsidering further study, do it for reasons other than a bigger pay cheque.\nWhen I ask happy people about the secret of their contentment, I often hear\nanswers like ‘You have to see the glass half-full rather than half-empty.’ It is as if\nthese individuals do not realise that they were born happy, and now tend to see\nthe positive in everything. They do not realise that cheerfulness – according to\nmany studies, such as those conducted by Harvard’s Dan Gilbert – is largely a\npersonality trait that remains constant throughout life. Or, as social scientists\nLykken and Tellegen starkly suggest, ‘trying to be happier is as futile as trying to\nbe taller.’\nThus, the \nswimmer’s body illusion\n is also a self-illusion. When these\noptimists write self-help books, the illusion can become treacherous. That’s why\nit’s important to give a wide berth to tips and advice from self-help authors. For\nbillions of people, these pieces of advice are unlikely to help. But because the\nunhappy don’t write self-help books about their failures, this fact remains hidden.\nIn conclusion: be wary when you are encouraged to strive for certain things –\nbe it abs of steel, immaculate looks, a higher income, a long life, a particular\ndemeanour or happiness. You might fall prey to the \nswimmer’s body illusion\n.\nBefore you decide to take the plunge, look in the mirror – and be honest about\nwhat you see.\nSee also \nHalo Effect\n (ch. 38); \nOutcome Bias\n (ch. 20); \nSelf-Selection Bias\n (ch. 47);\nAlternative Blindness\n (ch. 71); \nFundamental Attribution Error\n (ch. 36)\n3\nWHY YOU SEE SHAPES IN THE CLOUDS\nClustering Illusion\nIn 1957, Swedish opera singer Friedrich Jorgensen bought a tape player to\nrecord his vocals. When he listened back to the recording, he heard strange\nnoises throughout, whispers that sounded like supernatural messages. A few\nyears later, he recorded birdsong. This time, he heard the voice of his deceased\nmother in the background whispering to him: ‘Fried, my little Fried, can you hear\nme? It’s Mammy.’ That did it. Jorgensen turned his life around and devoted\nhimself to communicating with the deceased via tape recordings.\nIn 1994, Diane Duyser from Florida also had an otherworldly encounter. After\nbiting into a slice of toast and placing it back down on the plate, she noticed the\nface of the Virgin Mary in it. Immediately, she stopped eating and stored the\ndivine message (minus a bite) in a plastic container. In November 2004, she\nauctioned the still fairly well preserved snack on eBay. Her daily bread earned\nher $28,000.\nIn 1978, a woman from New Mexico had a similar experience. Her tortilla’s\nblackened spots resembled Jesus’ face. The press latched on to the story, and\nthousands of people ﬂocked to New Mexico to see the saviour in burrito form.\nTwo years earlier, in 1976, the orbiter of the Viking Spacecraft had photographed\na rock formation that, from high above, looked like a human face. The ‘Face on\nMars’ made headlines around the world.\nAnd you? Have you ever seen faces in the clouds or the outlines of animals in\nrocks? Of course. This is perfectly normal. The human brain seeks patterns and\nrules. In fact, it takes it one step further: if it ﬁnds no familiar patterns, it simply\ninvents some. The more diffuse the signal, such as the background noise on the\ntape, the easier it is to ﬁnd ‘hidden messages’ in it. Twenty-ﬁve years after\nuncovering the ‘Face on Mars’, the Mars Global Surveyor sent back crisp, clear\nimages of the rock formations: the captivating human face had dissolved into\nplain old scree.\nThese frothy examples make the clustering illusion seem innocuous; it is not.\nConsider the ﬁnancial markets, which churn out ﬂoods of data every second.\nGrinning ear to ear, a friend told me that he had discovered a pattern in the sea of\ndata: ‘If you multiply the percentage change of the Dow Jones by the percentage\nchange of the oil price, you get the move of the gold price in two days’ time.’ In\nother words, if share prices and oil climb or fall in unison, gold will rise the day\nafter tomorrow. His theory worked well for a few weeks, until he began to\nspeculate with ever-larger sums and eventually squandered his savings. He had\nsensed a pattern where none existed.\noxxxoxxxoxxoooxooxxoo. Is this sequence random or planned? Psychology\nprofessor Thomas Gilovich interviewed hundreds of people for an answer. Most\ndid not want to believe the sequence was arbitrary. They ﬁgured some law must\ngovern the order of the letters. Wrong, explained Gilovich, and pointed to some\ndice: it is quite possible to roll the same number four times in a row, which\nmystiﬁes many people. Apparently we have trouble accepting that such events\ncan take place by chance.\nDuring WWII, the Germans bombed London. Among other ammunition, they\nused V1 rockets, a kind of self-navigating drone. With each attack, the impact\nsites were carefully plotted on a map, terrifying Londoners: they thought they had\ndiscovered a pattern, and developed theories about which parts of the city were\nthe "

And if the crispy parts of your pancake start to look a lot\nlike Jesus’ face, ask yourself: if he really wants to reveal himself, why doesn’t he\ndo it in Times Square or on CNN?\nSee also \nIllusion of Control\n (ch. 17);\n Coincidence\n (ch. 24); \nFalse Causality\n (ch. 37)\n4\nIF 50 MILLION PEOPLE SAY SOMETHING FOOLISH, IT IS STILL\nFOOLISH\nSocial Proof\nYou are on your way to a concert. At an intersection, you encounter a group of\npeople, all staring at the sky. Without even thinking about it, you peer upwards\ntoo. Why? \nSocial proof\n. In the middle of the concert, when the soloist is displaying\nabsolute mastery, someone begins to clap and suddenly the whole room joins in.\nYou do, too. Why? \nSocial proof\n. After the concert you go to the coat check to pick\nup your coat. You watch how the people in front of you place a coin on a plate,\neven though, ofﬁcially, the service is included in the ticket price. What do you do?\nYou probably leave a tip as well.\nSocial proof, \nsometimes roughly termed the \nherd instinct,\n dictates that\nindividuals feel they are behaving correctly when they act the same as other\npeople. In other words, the more people who follow a certain idea, the better\n(truer) we deem the idea to be. And the more people who display a certain\nbehaviour the more appropriate this behaviour is judged to be by others. This is,\nof course, absurd.\nSocial proof\n is the evil behind bubbles and stock market panic. It exists in\nfashion, management techniques, hobbies, religion and diets. It can paralyse\nwhole cultures, such as when sects commit collective suicide.\nA simple experiment carried out in the 1950s by legendary psychologist\nSolomon Asch shows how peer pressure can warp common sense. A subject is\nshown a line drawn on paper, and next to it three lines – numbered 1, 2 and 3 –\none shorter, one longer and one of the same length as the original one. He or she\nmust indicate which of the three lines corresponds to the original one. If the\nperson is alone in the room, he gives correct answers – unsurprising, because\nthe task is really quite simple. Now ﬁve other people enter the room; they are all\nactors, which the subject does not know. One after another, they give wrong\nanswers, saying ‘number 1’, although it’s very clear that number 3 is the correct\nanswer. Then it is the subject’s turn again. In one third of cases, he will answer\nincorrectly to match the other people’s responses.\nWhy do we act like this? Well, in the past, following others was a good survival\nstrategy. Suppose that 50,000 years ago, you were travelling around the\nSerengeti with your hunter-gatherer friends, and suddenly they all bolted. What\nwould you have done? Would you have stayed put, scratching your head, and\nweighing up whether what you were looking at was a lion or something that just\nlooked like a lion but was in fact a harmless animal that could serve as a great\nprotein source? No, you would have sprinted after your friends. Later on, when\nyou were safe, you could have reﬂected on what the ‘lion’ had actually been.\nThose who acted differently from the group – and I am sure there were some –\nexited the gene pool. We are the direct descendants of those who copied the\nothers’ behaviour. This pattern is so deeply rooted in us that we still use it today,\neven when it offers no survival advantage, which is most of the time. Only a few\ncases come to mind where social proof is of value. For example, if you ﬁnd\nyourself hungry in a foreign city and don’t know a good restaurant, it makes sense\nto pick the one that’s full of locals. In other words, you copy the locals’ behaviour.\nComedy and talk shows make use of \nsocial proof\n by inserting canned laughter\nat strategic spots, inciting the audience to laugh along. One of the most\nimpressive, though troubling, cases of this phenomenon is the famous speech by\nNazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, delivered to a large audience in\n1943. (See it for yourself on YouTube.) As the war went from bad to worse for\nGermany, he demanded to know: ‘Do you want total war? If necessary, do you\nwant a war more total and radical than anything that we can even imagine today?’\nThe crowd roared. If the attendees had been asked individually and\nanonymously, it is likely that nobody would have consented to this crazy\nproposal.\nThe advertising industry beneﬁts greatly from our weakness for \nsocial proof\n.\nThis works well when a situation is unclear (such as deciding among various car\nmakes, cleaning products, beauty products etc. with no obvious advantages or\ndisadvantages), and where people ‘like you and me’ appear.\nSo, be sceptical whenever a company claims its product is better because it is\n‘the most popular’. How is a product better simply because it sells the most units?\nAnd remember novelist W. Somerset Maugham’s wise words: ‘If 50 million\npeople say something foolish, it is still foolish.’\nSee also \nGroupthink\n (ch. 25);\n Social Loafing\n (ch. 33);\n In-Group Out-Group Bias\n (ch. 79);\nFalse-Consensus Effect\n (ch. 77)\n5\nWHY YOU SHOULD FORGET THE PAST\nSunk Cost Fallacy\nThe ﬁlm was dire. After an hour, I whispered to my wife: ‘Come on, let’s go home.’\nShe replied: ‘No way. We’re not throwing away $30.’ ‘That’s no reason to stay,’ I\nprotested. ‘The money’s already gone. This is the \nsunk cost fallacy\n at work – a\nthinking error!’ She glared at me as if she had just bitten off a piece of lemon. OK,\nI sometimes go overboard on the subject, itself an error called \ndéformation\nprofessionnelle\n (see chapter 92). ‘We have spent the $30 regardless of whether\nwe stay or leave, so this factor should not play a role in our decision,’ I said,\ndesperately trying to clarify the situation. Needless to say, I gave in in the end and\nsank back down in my seat.\nThe next day, I sat in a marketing meeting. Our advertising campaign had been\nrunning for four months and had not met even one of its goals. I was in favour of\nscrapping it. The advertising manager resisted, saying: ‘But we’ve invested so\nmuch money in it. If we stop now, it’ll all have been for nothing.’ Another victim of\nthe \nsunk cost fallacy\n.\nA friend struggled for years in a troubled relationship. His girlfriend cheated on\nhim time and again. Each time, she came back repentant and begged for\nforgiveness. He explained it to me this way: ‘I’ve invested so much energy in the\nrelationship, it would be wrong to throw it away.’ A classic case of the \nsunk cost\nfallacy\n.\nThe \nsunk cost fallacy\n is most dangerous when we have invested a lot of time,\nmoney, energy or love in something. This investment becomes a reason to carry\non, even if we are dealing with a lost cause. The more we invest, the greater the\nsunk costs are, and the greater the urge to continue becomes.\nInvestors frequently fall victim to the \nsunk cost fallacy\n. Often they base their\ntrading decisions on acquisition prices. ‘I lost so much money with this stock, I\ncan’t sell it now,’ they say. This is irrational. The acquisition price should play no\nrole. What counts is the stock’s future performance (and the future performance of\nalternative investments). Ironically, the more money a share loses, the more\ninvestors tend to stick by it.\nThis irrational behaviour is driven by a need for consistency. After all,\nconsistency signiﬁes credibility. We ﬁnd contradictions abominable. If we decide\nto cancel a project halfway through, we create a contradiction: we admit that we\nonce thought differently. Carrying on with a meaningless project delays this\npainful realisation and keeps up appearances.\nConcorde is a prime example of a government deﬁcit project. Even though both\nparties, Britain and France, had long known that the supersonic aircraft business\nwould never work, they continued to invest enormous sums of money in it – if only\nto save face. Abandoning the project would have been tantamount to admitting\ndefeat. The \nsunk cost fallacy\n is therefore often referred to as the \nConcorde effect\n.\nIt leads to costly, even disastrous errors of judgement.

But beware of doing so for the wrong reasons, such as to justify non-\nrecoverable investments. Rational decision-making requires you to forget about\nthe costs incurred to date. No matter how much you have already invested, only\nyour assessment of the future costs and benefits counts.\nSee also \nThe It’ll-Get-Worse-Before-It-Gets-Better Fallacy\n (ch.12);\n Inability to Close\nDoors\n (ch. 68);\n Endowment Effect\n (ch. 23);\n Effort Justification\n (ch. 60); \nLoss Aversion\n(ch. 32); \nOutcome Bias\n (ch. 20)\n6\nDON’T ACCEPT FREE DRINKS\nReciprocity\nNot so long ago, you may have come across disciples of the Hare Krishna sect\nﬂoating around in saffron-coloured robes as you hurried to catch a ﬂight or a train\nto your destination. A member of the sect presented you with a small ﬂower and a\nsmile. If you’re like most people, you took the ﬂower, if only not to be rude. If you\ntried to refuse, you would have heard a gentle ‘Take it, this is our gift to you.’ If\nyou wanted to dispose of the ﬂower in the next trashcan, you found that there\nwere already a few there. But that was not the end. Just as your bad conscience\nstarted to tug at you, another disciple of Krishna approached you, this time asking\nfor a donation. In many cases, this plea was successful – and so pervasive that\nmany airports banned the sect from the premises.\nPsychologist Robert Cialdini can explain the success of this and other such\ncampaigns. He has studied the phenomenon of \nreciprocity\n and has established\nthat people have extreme difficulty being in another person’s debt.\nMany NGOs and philanthropic organisations use exactly the same techniques:\nﬁrst give, then take. Last week, a conservation organisation sent me an envelope\nfull of postcards featuring all sorts of idyllic landscapes. The accompanying letter\nassured me that the postcards were a gift to be kept, whether or not I decided to\ndonate to their organisation. Even though I understood the tactic, it took a little\nwillpower and ruthlessness to throw them in the trash.\nUnfortunately, this kind of gentle blackmail – you could also call it corruption –\nis widespread. A supplier of screws invites a potential customer to join him at a\nbig sports game. A month later, it’s time to order screws. The desire not to be in\ndebt is so strong that the buyer gives in and places an order with his new friend.\nIt is also an ancient technique. We ﬁnd \nreciprocity\n in all species whose food\nsupplies are subject to high ﬂuctuations. Suppose you are a hunter-gatherer. One\nday you are lucky and kill a deer. You can’t possibly eat all of it in a day, and\nrefrigerators are still a few centuries away. You decide to share the deer with the\ngroup, which ensures that you will beneﬁt from others’ spoils when your haul is\nless impressive. The bellies of your buddies serve as your refrigerator.\nReciprocity\n is a very useful survival strategy, a form of risk management.\nWithout it, humanity – and countless species of animal – would be long extinct. It\nis at the core of cooperation between people who are not related to each other\nand a necessary ingredient for economic growth and wealth creation. There\nwould be no global economy without it – there would be no economy at all. That’s\nthe good side of \nreciprocity\n.\nBut there is also an ugly side of \nreciprocity\n: retaliation. Revenge breeds\ncounter-revenge and you soon ﬁnd yourself in a full-scale war. Jesus preached\nthat we should break this cycle by turning the other cheek, which proves very\ndifﬁcult to do. So compelling is the pull of \nreciprocity \neven when the stakes are far\nless high.\nSeveral years ago, a couple invited me and my wife to dinner. We had known\nthis couple casually for quite some time. They were nice, but far from entertaining.\nWe couldn’t think of a good excuse to refuse, so we accepted. Things played out\nexactly as we had imagined: the dinner party was beyond tedious. Nevertheless,\nwe felt obliged to invite them to our home a few months later. The constraint of\nreciprocity\n had now presented us with two wearisome evenings. And, lo and\nbehold, a few weeks later a follow-up invitation from them arrived. I wonder how\nmany dinner parties have been endured in the name of \nreciprocity\n, even if the\nparticipants would have preferred to drop out of the vicious cycle years ago.\nIn much the same way, if someone approaches you in the supermarket,\nwhether to offer you a taste of wine, a chunk of cheese or a handful of olives, my\nbest advice is to refuse their offer – unless you want to end up with a refrigerator\nfull of stuff you don’t even like.\nSee also \nFraming\n (ch. 42);\n Incentive Super-Response Tendency\n (ch. 18); \nLiking Bias\n(ch. 22); \nMotivation Crowding\n (ch. 56)\n7\nBEWARE THE ‘SPECIAL CASE’\nConfirmation Bias (Part 1)\nGil wants to lose weight. He selects a particular diet and checks his progress on\nthe scales every morning. If he has lost weight, he pats himself on the back and\nconsiders the diet a success. If he has gained weight, he writes it off as a normal\nfluctuation and forgets about it. For months, he lives under the illusion that the diet\nis working, even though his weight remains constant. Gil is a victim of the\nconfirmation bias\n – albeit a harmless form of it.\nThe \nconﬁrmation bias\n is the mother of all misconceptions. It is the tendency to\ninterpret new information so that it becomes compatible with our existing theories,\nbeliefs and convictions. In other words, we ﬁlter out any new information that\ncontradicts our existing views (‘disconﬁrming evidence’). This is a dangerous\npractice. ‘Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored,’ said writer\nAldous Huxley. However, we do exactly that, as super-investor Warren Buffett\nknows: ‘What the human being is best at doing, is interpreting all new information\nso that their prior conclusions remain intact.’\nThe \nconfirmation bias\n is alive and well in the business world. One example: an\nexecutive team decides on a new strategy. The team enthusiastically celebrates\nany sign that the strategy is a success. Everywhere the executives look, they see\nplenty of conﬁrming evidence, while indications to the contrary remain unseen or\nare quickly dismissed as ‘exceptions’ or ‘special cases’. They have become blind\nto disconfirming evidence.\nWhat can you do? If the word ‘exception’ crops up, prick up your ears. Often it\nhides the presence of disconﬁrming evidence. It pays to listen to Charles Darwin:\nfrom his youth, he set out systematically to ﬁght the \nconﬁrmation bias\n. Whenever\nobservations contradicted his theory, he took them very seriously and noted them\ndown immediately. He knew that the brain actively ‘forgets’ disconﬁrming\nevidence after a short time. The more correct he judged his theory to be, the more\nactively he looked for contradictions.\nThe following experiment shows how much effort it takes to question your own\ntheory. A professor presented his students with the number sequence 2–4–6.\nThey had to calculate the underlying rule that the professor had written on the\nback of a sheet of paper. The students had to provide the next number in the\nsequence, to which the professor would reply ‘ﬁts the rule’ or ‘does not ﬁt the\nrule’. The students could guess as many numbers as they wanted, but could try to\nidentify the rule only once. Most students suggested 8 as the next number, and\nthe professor replied: ‘Fits the rule.’ To be sure, they tried 10, 12 and 14. The\nprofessor replied each time: ‘Fits the rule.’ The students concluded that: ‘The rule\nis to add two to the last number.’ The professor shook his head: ‘That is not the\nrule.’\nOne shrewd student tried a different approach. He tested out the number -2.\nThe professor said ‘Does not ﬁt the rule.’ ‘Seven?’ he asked. ‘Fits the rule.’ The\nstudent tried all sorts of numbers -24, 9, -43?. . .?Apparently he had an idea, and\nhe was trying to ﬁnd a ﬂaw with it. Only when he could no longer ﬁnd a counter-\nexample, the student said: ‘The rule is this: the next number must be higher than\nthe previous one.’ The professor turned over the sheet of paper, and thi"

While the majority\nof students sought merely to conﬁrm their theories, he tried to ﬁnd fault with his,\nconsciously looking for disconﬁrming evidence. You might think: ‘Good for him,\nbut not the end of the world for the others.’ However, falling for the \nconfirmation\nbias\n is not a petty intellectual offence. How it affects our lives will be revealed in\nthe next chapter.\nSee also \nAvailability Bias\n (ch. 11);\n Feature-Positive Effect\n (ch. 95); \nCoincidence\n (ch. 24);\nForer Effect\n (ch. 64); \nIllusion of Attention\n (ch. 88)\n8\nMURDER YOUR DARLINGS\nConfirmation Bias (Part 2)\nIn the previous chapter, we met the father of all fallacies, the \nconﬁrmation bias\n.\nWe are forced to establish beliefs about the world, our lives, the economy,\ninvestments, our careers and more. We deal mostly in assumptions, and the more\nnebulous these are, the stronger the \nconﬁrmation bias\n. Whether you go through\nlife believing that ‘people are inherently good’ or ‘people are inherently bad’, you\nwill ﬁnd daily proof to support your case. Both parties, the philanthropists and the\nmisanthropes, simply ﬁlter disconﬁrming evidence (evidence to the contrary) and\nfocus instead on the do-gooders and dictators who support their worldviews.\nAstrologers and economists operate on the same principle. They utter\nprophecies so vague that any event can substantiate them: ‘In the coming weeks\nyou will experience sadness,’ or ‘in the medium term, the pressure on the dollar\nwill increase.’ But what is the medium term? What will cause the dollar to\ndepreciate? And, depreciation measured against what – gold, yen, pesos, wheat,\nresidential property in Manhattan, the average price of a hot dog?\nReligious and philosophical beliefs represent an excellent breeding ground for\nthe \nconﬁrmation bias\n. Here, in soft, spongy terrain, it grows wild and free. For\nexample, worshippers always ﬁnd evidence for God’s existence, even though he\nnever shows himself overtly – except to illiterates in the desert and in isolated\nmountain villages. It is never to the masses in, say, Frankfurt or New York.\nCounter-arguments are dismissed by the faithful, demonstrating just how powerful\nthe \nconfirmation bias\n is.\nNo professionals suffer more from the \nconﬁrmation bias \nthan business\njournalists. Often, they formulate an easy theory, pad it out with two or three\npieces of ‘evidence’ and call it a day. For example: ‘Google is so successful\nbecause the company nurtures a culture of creativity.’ Once this idea is on paper,\nthe journalist corroborates it by mentioning a few other prosperous companies\nthat foster ingenuity. Rarely does the writer seek out disconﬁrming evidence,\nwhich in this instance would be struggling businesses that live and breathe\ncreativity or, conversely, ﬂourishing ﬁrms that are utterly uncreative. Both groups\nhave plenty of members, but the journalist simply ignores them. If he or she were\nto mention just one, the storyline would be ruined.\nSelf-help and get-rich-quick books are further examples of blinkered\nstorytelling. Their shrewd authors collect piles of proof to pump up the most banal\nof theories, such as ‘meditation is the key to happiness.’ Any reader seeking\ndisconﬁrming evidence does so in vain: nowhere in these books do we see\npeople who lead fulﬁlled lives without meditation, or those who, despite\nmeditation, are still sad.\nThe Internet is particularly fertile ground for the \nconﬁrmation bias\n. To stay\ninformed, we browse news sites and blogs, forgetting that our favoured pages\nmirror our existing values, be they liberal, conservative or somewhere in between.\nMoreover, a lot of sites now tailor content to personal interests and browsing\nhistory, causing new and divergent opinions to vanish from the radar altogether.\nWe inevitably land in communities of like-minded people, further reinforcing our\nconvictions – and the \nconfirmation bias\n.\nLiterary critic Arthur Quiller-Couch had a memorable motto: ‘Murder your\ndarlings.’ This was his advice to writers who struggled with cutting cherished but\nredundant sentences. Quiller-Couch’s appeal is not just for hesitant hacks, but for\nall of us who suffer from the deafening silence of assent. To ﬁght against the\nconﬁrmation bias\n, try writing down your beliefs – whether in terms of worldview,\ninvestments, marriage, healthcare, diet, career strategies – and set out to ﬁnd\ndisconﬁrming evidence. Axeing beliefs that feel like old friends is hard work, but\nimperative.\nSee also \nIntrospection Illusion\n (ch. 67);\n Salience Effect\n (ch. 83);\n Cognitive Dissonance\n(ch. 50); \nForer Effect\n (ch. 64); \nNews Illusion\n (ch. 99)\n9\nDON’T BOW TO AUTHORITY\nAuthority Bias\nThe ﬁrst book of the Bible explains what happens when we disobey a great\nauthority: we get ejected from paradise. This is also what less celestial authorities\nwould have us believe – political pundits, scientists, doctors, CEOs, economists,\ngovernment heads, sports commentators, consultants and stock market gurus.\nAuthorities pose two main problems to clear thinking: ﬁrst, their track records\nare often sobering. There are about one million trained economists on the planet,\nand not one of them could accurately predict the timing of the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis\n(with the exception of Nouriel Roubini and Nassim Taleb), let alone how the\ncollapse would play out, from the real-estate bubble bursting to credit default\nswaps collapsing, right through to the full-blown economic crunch. Never has a\ngroup of experts failed so spectacularly. The story from the medical world is much\nthe same: up until 1900 it was discernibly wiser for patients to avoid doctor’s\nvisits; too often the ‘treatment’ only worsened the illness, due to poor hygiene and\nfolk practices such as bloodletting.\nPsychologist Stanley Milgram demonstrated the \nauthority bias\n most clearly in\nan experiment in 1961. His subjects were instructed to administer ever-increasing\nelectrical shocks to a person sitting on the other side of a pane of glass. They\nwere told to start with 15 volts, then 30V, 45V and so on, until they reached the\nmaximum – a lethal dose of 450V. In reality, no electrical current was actually\nﬂowing; Milgram used an actor to play the role of victim, but those charged with\nadministering the shocks didn’t know that. The results were, well, shocking: as\nthe person in the other room wailed and writhed in pain, and the subject\nadministering the shock wanted to stop, the professor would say, ‘Keep going, the\nexperiment depends on it.’ The majority of people continued with the\nelectrocution. More than half of the participants went all the way up to maximum\nvoltage – out of sheer obedience to authority.\nOver the past decade, airlines have also learned the dangers of the \nauthority\nbias\n. In the old days, the captain was king. His commands were not to be\ndoubted. If a co-pilot suspected an oversight, he wouldn’t have dared to address it\nout of respect for – or fear of – his captain. Since this behaviour was discovered,\nnearly every airline has instituted ‘Crew Resource Management’ (CRM), which\ncoaches pilots and their crews to discuss any reservations they have openly and\nquickly. In other words: they carefully deprogramme the \nauthority bias\n. CRM has\ncontributed more to ﬂight safety in the past twenty years than any technical\nadvances have.\nMany companies are light years from this sort of foresight. Especially at risk are\nﬁrms with domineering CEOs, where employees are likely to keep their ‘lesser’\nopinions to themselves – much to the detriment of the business.\nAuthorities crave recognition and constantly ﬁnd ways to reinforce their status.\nDoctors and researchers sport white coats. Bank directors don suits and ties.\nKings wear crowns. Members of the military wield rank badges. Today, even\nmore symbols and props are used to signal expertise: from appearances on talk\nshows and on the covers of magazines, to book tours and their own Wikipedia\nentries. Authority changes much like fashion does, and society follows it just as\nmuch.\nIn conclusion: whenever you are about to make a decision, think about which\nauthority ﬁgures might be exerting an inﬂuence on your reasoning. And when you\nencounter one in the flesh, do your best to challenge him or her.\nSee also \nTwaddle Tendency\n (ch. 57);\n Chauffeur Knowledge\n (ch. 16);\n Forecast Illusion\n(ch. 40); \nIllusion of Skill\n (ch. 94)\n10\nLEAVE YOUR SUPERMODEL FRIENDS AT HOME\nContrast Effect\nIn hi"

      "chapter_text": "s book \nInfluence\n, Robert Cialdini tells the story of two brothers, Sid and\nHarry, who ran a clothing store in 1930s America. Sid was in charge of sales and\nHarry led the tailoring department. Whenever Sid noticed that the customers who\nstood before the mirror really liked their suits, he became a little hard of hearing.\nHe would call to his brother: ‘Harry, how much for this suit?’ Harry would look up\nfrom his cutting table and shout back: ‘For that beautiful cotton suit, $42.’ (This\nwas a completely inﬂated price at that time.) Sid would pretend he hadn’t\nunderstood: ‘How much?’ Harry would yell again: ‘Forty-two dollars!’ Sid would\nthen turn to his customer and report: ‘He says $22.’ At this point, the customer\nwould have quickly put the money on the table and hastened from the store with\nthe suit before poor Sid noticed his ‘mistake’.\nMaybe you know the following experiment from your schooldays: take two\nbuckets. Fill the ﬁrst with lukewarm water and the second with ice water. Dip your\nright hand into the ice water for one minute. Then put both hands into the\nlukewarm water. What do you notice? The lukewarm water feels as it should to\nthe left hand but piping hot to the right hand.\nBoth of these stories epitomise the \ncontrast effect\n: we judge something to be\nbeautiful, expensive or large if we have something ugly, cheap or small in front of\nus. We have difficulty with absolute judgements.\nThe \ncontrast effect\n is a common misconception. You order leather seats for\nyour new car because compared to the $60,000 price tag on the car, $3,000\nseems a pittance. All industries that offer upgrade options exploit this illusion.\nThe \ncontrast effect\n is at work in other places, too. Experiments show that\npeople are willing to walk an extra ten minutes to save $10 on food. But those\nsame people wouldn’t dream of walking ten minutes to save $10 on a thousand-\ndollar suit. An irrational move because ten minutes is ten minutes, and $10 is\n$10. Logically, you should walk back in both cases or not at all.\nWithout the \ncontrast effect\n, the discount business would be completely\nuntenable. A product that has been reduced from $100 to $70 seems better value\nthan a product that has always cost $70. The starting price should play no role.\nThe other day an investor told me: ‘The share is a great value because it’s 50 per\ncent below the peak price.’ I shook my head. A share price is never ‘low’ or ‘high’.\nIt is what it is, and the only thing that matters is whether it goes up or down from\nthat point.\nWhen we encounter contrasts, we react like birds to a gunshot: we jump up and\nget moving. Our weak spot: we don’t notice small, gradual changes. A magician\ncan make your watch vanish because, when he presses on one part of your body,\nyou don’t notice the lighter touch on your wrist as he relieves you of your Rolex.\nSimilarly, we fail to notice how our money disappears. It constantly loses its\nvalue, but we do not notice because inﬂation happens over time. If it were\nimposed on us in the form of a brutal tax (and basically that’s what it is), we would\nbe outraged.\nThe \ncontrast effect\n can ruin your whole life: a charming woman marries a fairly\naverage man. But because her parents were awful people, the ordinary man\nappears to be a prince.\nOne ﬁnal thought: bombarded by advertisements featuring supermodels, we\nnow perceive beautiful people as only moderately attractive. If you are seeking a\npartner, never go out in the company of your supermodel friends. People will ﬁnd\nyou less attractive than you really are. Go alone or, better yet, take two ugly\nfriends.\nSee also \nAvailability Bias\n (ch. 11);\n Endowment Effect\n (ch. 23);\n Halo Effect\n (ch. 38);\nSocial Comparison Bias\n (ch. 72); \nRegression to Mean\n (ch. 19); \nScarcity Error\n (ch. 27);\nFraming\n (ch. 42)\n11\nWHY WE PREFER A WRONG MAP TO NO MAP AT ALL\nAvailability Bias\n‘Smoking can’t be that bad for you: my grandfather smoked three packs of\ncigarettes a day and lived to be more than 100.’ Or: ‘Manhattan is really safe. I\nknow someone who lives in the middle of the Village and he never locks his door.\nNot even when he goes on vacation, and his apartment has never been broken\ninto.’ We use statements like these to try to prove something, but they actually\nprove nothing at all. When we speak like this, we succumb to the \navailability bias\n.\nAre there more English words that start with a K or more words with K as their\nthird letter? Answer: more than twice as many English words have K in third\nposition than start with a K. Why do most people believe the opposite is true?\nBecause we can think of words beginning with a K more quickly. They are more\navailable to our memory.\nThe \navailability bias\n says this: we create a picture of the world using the\nexamples that most easily come to mind. This is absurd, of course, because in\nreality things don’t happen more frequently just because we can conceive of them\nmore easily.\nThanks to the \navailability bias\n, we travel through life with an incorrect risk map\nin our heads. Thus, we systematically overestimate the risk of being the victim of\na plane crash, a car accident or a murder. And we underestimate the risk of dying\nfrom less spectacular means, such as diabetes or stomach cancer. The chances\nof bomb attacks are much rarer than we think, and the chances of suffering\ndepression are much higher. We attach too much likelihood to spectacular, ﬂashy\nor loud outcomes. Anything silent or invisible we downgrade in our minds. Our\nbrains imagine show-stopping outcomes more readily than mundane ones. We\nthink dramatically, not quantitatively.\nDoctors often fall victim to the \navailability bias\n. They have their favourite\ntreatments, which they use for all possible cases. More appropriate treatments\nmay exist, but these are in the recesses of the doctors’ minds. Consequently they\npractise what they know. Consultants are no better. If they come across an\nentirely new case, they do not throw up their hands and sigh: ‘I really don’t know\nwhat to tell you.’ Instead they turn to one of their more familiar methods, whether\nor not it is ideal.\nIf something is repeated often enough, it gets stored at the forefront of our\nminds. It doesn’t even have to be true. How often did the Nazi leaders have to\nrepeat the term ‘the Jewish question’ before the masses began to believe that it\nwas a serious problem? You simply have to utter the words ‘UFO’, ‘life energy’ or\n‘karma’ enough times before people start to credit them.\nThe \navailability bias\n has an established seat at the corporate board’s table, too.\nBoard members discuss what management has submitted – usually quarterly\nﬁgures – instead of more important things, such as a clever move by the\ncompetition, a slump in employee motivation or an unexpected change in\ncustomer behaviour. They tend not to discuss what’s not on the agenda. In\naddition, people prefer information that is easy to obtain, be it economic data or\nrecipes. They make decisions based on this information rather than on more\nrelevant but harder to obtain information – often with disastrous results. For\nexample, we have known for ten years that the so-called Black–Scholes formula\nfor the pricing of derivative ﬁnancial products does not work. But we don’t have\nanother solution, so we carry on with an incorrect tool. It is as if you were in a\nforeign city without a map, and then pulled out one for your home town and simply\nused that. We prefer \nwrong\n information to \nno\n information. Thus, the \navailability\nbias\n has presented the banks with billions in losses.\nWhat was it that Frank Sinatra sang? ‘Oh, my heart is beating wildly/And it’s all\nbecause you’re here/When I’m not near the girl I love/I love the girl I’m near.’ A\nperfect example of the \navailability bias\n. Fend it off by spending time with people\nwho think differently than you think – people whose experiences and expertise\nare different than yours. We require others’ input to overcome the \navailability bias\n.\nSee also \nAmbiguity Aversion\n (ch. 80);\n Illusion of Attention\n (ch. 88);\n Association Bias\n(ch. 48); \nFeature-Positive Effect\n (ch. 95); \nConfirmation Bias\n (ch. 7–8); \nContrast Effect\n (ch.\n10); \nNeglect of Probability\n (ch. 26)\n12\nWHY ‘NO PAIN, NO GAIN’ SHOULD SET ALARM BELLS RINGING\nThe It’ll-Get-Worse-Before-It-Gets-Better Fallacy\nA few years ago, I was on vacation in Corsica and fell sick.

      "chapter_text": "ng doctor began to inspect me, prodding my stomach,\ngripping my shoulders and knees and then poking each vertebra. I began to\nsuspect that he had no idea what my problem was, but I wasn’t really sure so I\nsimply endured the strange examination. To signal its end, he pulled out his\nnotebook and said: ‘Antibiotics. Take one tablet three times a day. It’ll get worse\nbefore it gets better.’ Glad that I now had a treatment, I dragged myself back to my\nhotel room with the prescription in hand.\nThe pain grew worse and worse – just as the doctor had predicted. The doctor\nmust have known what was wrong with me after all. But, when the pain hadn’t\nsubsided after three days, I called him. ‘Increase the dose to ﬁve times a day. It’s\ngoing to hurt for a while more,’ he said. After two more days of agony, I ﬁnally\ncalled the international air ambulance. The Swiss doctor diagnosed appendicitis\nand operated on me immediately. ‘Why did you wait so long?’ he asked me after\nthe surgery.\nI replied: ‘It all happened exactly as the doctor said, so I trusted him.’\n‘Ah, you fell victim to the it’ll-get-worse-before-it-gets-better fallacy. That\nCorsican doctor had no idea. Probably just the same type of stand-in you ﬁnd in\nall the tourist places in high season.’\nLet’s take another example: a CEO is at his wits’ end. Sales are in the toilet, the\nsalespeople are unmotivated, and the marketing campaign has sunk without a\ntrace. In his desperation, he hires a consultant. For $5,000 a day, this man\nanalyses the company and comes back with his ﬁndings: ‘Your sales department\nhas no vision, and your brand isn’t positioned clearly. It’s a tricky situation. I can\nﬁx it for you – but not overnight. The measures will require sensitivity, and most\nlikely, sales will fall further before things improve.’ The CEO hires the consultant.\nA year later, sales fall, and the same thing happens the next year. Again and\nagain, the consultant stresses that the company’s progress corresponds closely\nto his prediction. As sales continue their slump in the third year, the CEO ﬁres the\nconsultant.\nA mere smokescreen, the \nIt’ll-Get-Worse-Before-It-Gets-Better Fallacy\n is a\nvariant of the so-called \nconfirmation bias\n. If the problem continues to worsen, the\nprediction is conﬁrmed. If the situation improves unexpectedly, the customer is\nhappy and the expert can attribute it to his prowess. Either way he wins.\nSuppose you are president of a country, and have no idea how to run it. What\ndo you do? You predict ‘difﬁcult years’ ahead, ask your citizens to ‘tighten their\nbelts’, and then promise to improve the situation only after this ‘delicate stage’ of\nthe ‘cleansing’, ‘puriﬁcation’ and ‘restructuring’. Naturally you leave the duration\nand severity of the period open.\nThe best evidence of this strategy’s success is Christianity: its literal followers\nbelieve that before we can experience heaven on earth, the world must be\ndestroyed. Disasters, ﬂoods, ﬁres, death – they are all part of the larger plan and\nmust take place. Believers will view any deterioration of the situation as\nconfirmation of the prophecy, and any improvement as a gift from God.\nIn conclusion: if someone says ‘It’ll get worse before it gets better,’ you should\nhear alarm bells ringing. But beware: situations do exist where things ﬁrst dip and\nthen improve. For example, a career change requires time and often incorporates\nloss of pay. The reorganisation of a business also takes time. But in all these\ncases, we can see relatively quickly if the measures are working. The milestones\nare clear and verifiable. Look to these rather than to the heavens.\nSee also \nAction Bias\n (ch. 43);\n Sunk Cost Fallacy\n (ch. 5); \nRegression to the Mean\n (ch. 19)\n13\nEVEN TRUE STORIES ARE FAIRYTALES\nStory Bias\nLife is a muddle, as intricate as a Gordian knot. Imagine that an invisible Martian\ndecides to follow you around with an equally invisible notebook, recording what\nyou do, think and dream. The rundown of your life would consist of entries such\nas ‘drank coffee, two sugars’, ‘stepped on a thumbtack and swore like a sailor’,\n‘dreamed that I kissed the neighbour’, ‘booked vacation, Maldives, now nearly out\nof money’, ‘found hair sticking out of ear, plucked it straight away’ and so on. We\nlike to knit this jumble of details into a neat story. We want our lives to form a\npattern that can be easily followed. Many call this guiding principle ‘meaning’. If\nour story advances evenly over the years, we refer to it as ‘identity’. ‘We try on\nstories as we try on clothes,’ said Max Frisch, a famous Swiss novelist.\nWe do the same with world history, shaping the details into a consistent story.\nSuddenly we ‘understand’ certain things; for example, why the Treaty of\nVersailles led to the Second World War, or why Alan Greenspan’s loose\nmonetary policy created the collapse of Lehman Brothers. We comprehend why\nthe Iron Curtain had to fall or why Harry Potter became a best-seller. Here, we\nspeak about ‘understanding’, but these things cannot be understood in the\ntraditional sense. We simply build the meaning into them afterward. Stories are\ndubious entities. They simplify and distort reality, and ﬁlter things that don’t ﬁt. But\napparently we cannot do without them. Why remains unclear. What is clear is that\npeople ﬁrst used stories to explain the world, before they began to think\nscientiﬁcally, making mythology older than philosophy. This has led to the \nstory\nbias\n.\nIn the media, the \nstory bias\n rages like wildﬁre. For example: a car is driving\nover a bridge when the structure suddenly collapses. What do we read the next\nday? We hear the tale of the unlucky driver, where he came from and where he\nwas going. We read his biography: born somewhere, grew up somewhere else,\nearned a living as something. If he survives and can give interviews, we hear\nexactly how it felt when the bridge came crashing down. The absurd thing: not\none of these stories explains the underlying cause of the accident. Skip past the\ndriver’s account and consider the bridge’s construction: where was the weak\npoint? Was it fatigue? If not, was the bridge damaged? If so, by what? Was a\nproper design even used? Where are there other bridges of the same design?\nThe problem with all these questions is that, though valid, they just don’t make for\na good yarn. Stories attract us; abstract details repel us. Consequently,\nentertaining side issues and backstories are prioritised over relevant facts. (On\nthe upside, if it were not for this, we would be stuck with only non-fiction books.)\nHere are two stories from the English novelist E. M. Forster. Which one would\nyou remember better? A) ‘The king died, and the queen died.’ B) ‘The king died,\nand the queen died of grief.’ Most people will retain the second story more easily.\nHere, the two deaths don’t just take place successively; they are emotionally\nlinked. Story A is a factual report, but story B has ‘meaning’. According to\ninformation theory, we should be able to hold on to A better: it is shorter. But our\nbrains don’t work that way.\nAdvertisers have learned to capitalise on this too. Instead of focusing on an\nitem’s beneﬁts, they create a story around it. Objectively speaking, narratives are\nirrelevant, but still we find them irresistible. Google illustrated this masterfully in its\nSuper Bowl commercial from 2010, ‘Google Parisian Love’. Take a look at it on\nYouTube.\nFrom our own life stories to global events, we shape everything into meaningful\nstories. Doing so distorts reality and affects the quality of our decisions, but there\nis a remedy: pick these apart. Ask yourself: what are they trying to hide? Visit the\nlibrary and spend half a day reading old newspapers. You will see that events\nthat today look connected weren’t so at the time. To experience the effect once\nmore, try to view your life story out of context. Dig into your old journals and notes,\nand you’ll see that your life has not followed a straight arrow leading to today, but\nhas been a series of unplanned, unconnected events and experiences, as we’ll\nsee in the next chapter.\nWhenever you hear a story, ask yourself: who is the sender, what are his\nintentions and what did he hide under the rug? The omitted elements might not\nbe of relevance. But then again, they might be even more relevant than the\nelements featured in the story, such as when ‘explaining’ a ﬁnancial crisis or the\n‘cause’ of war. The real issue with stories: they give us a false sense of\nunderstanding, which inevitably "

In 1932, he emigrated from a\ntiny Swiss village to Paris to seek his fortune in the movie industry. In August\n1940, two months after Paris was occupied, he noted: ‘Everyone is certain that\nthe Germans will leave by the end of the year. Their ofﬁcers also conﬁrmed this to\nme. England will fall as fast as France did, and then we will ﬁnally have our\nParisian lives back – albeit as part of Germany.’ The occupation lasted four years.\nIn today’s history books, the German occupation of France seems to form part\nof a clear military strategy. In retrospect, the actual course of the war appears the\nmost likely of all scenarios. Why? Because we have fallen victim to the \nhindsight\nbias\n.\nLet’s take a more recent example: in 2007, economic experts painted a rosy\npicture for the coming years. However, just twelve months later, the ﬁnancial\nmarkets imploded. Asked about the crisis, the same experts enumerated its\ncauses: monetary expansion under Greenspan, lax validation of mortgages,\ncorrupt rating agencies, low capital requirements, and so forth. In hindsight, the\nreasons for the crash seem painfully obvious.\nThe \nhindsight bias\n is one of the most prevailing fallacies of all. We can aptly\ndescribe it as the ‘I told you so’ phenomenon: in retrospect, everything seems\nclear and inevitable. If a CEO becomes successful due to fortunate circumstances\nhe will, looking back, rate the probability of his success a lot higher than it\nactually was. Similarly, following Ronald Reagan’s massive election victory over\nJimmy Carter in 1980, commentators announced his appointment to be\nforeseeable, even though the election lay on a knife-edge until a few days before\nthe ﬁnal vote. Today, business journalists opine that Google’s dominance was\npredestined, even though each of them would have snorted had such a prediction\nbeen made in 1998. One particularly blundering example: nowadays it seems\ntragic, yet completely plausible, that a single shot in Sarajevo in 1914 would\ntotally upturn the world for thirty years and cost 50 million lives. Every child learns\nthis historical detail in school. But back then, nobody would have dreamed of\nsuch an escalation. It would have sounded too absurd.\nSo why is the \nhindsight bias\n so perilous? Well, it makes us believe we are\nbetter predictors than we actually are, causing us to be arrogant about our\nknowledge and consequently to take too much risk. And not just with global\nissues: ‘Have you heard? Sylvia and Chris aren’t together any more. It was\nalways going to go wrong, they were just so different.’ Or: ‘They were just so\nsimilar.’ Or: ‘They spent too much time together.’ Or even: ‘They barely saw one\nanother.’\nOvercoming the \nhindsight bias\n is not easy. Studies have shown that people\nwho are aware of it fall for it just as much as everyone else. So, I’m very sorry, but\nyou’ve just wasted your time reading this chapter.\nIf you’re still with me, I have one ﬁnal tip, this time from personal rather than\nprofessional experience: keep a journal. Write down your predictions – for\npolitical changes, your career, your weight, the stock market and so on. Then,\nfrom time to time, compare your notes with actual developments. You will be\namazed at what a poor forecaster you are. Don’t forget to read history too – not\nthe retrospective, compacted theories compiled in textbooks, but the diaries, oral\nhistories and historical documents from the period. If you can’t live without news,\nread newspapers from ﬁve, ten or twenty years ago. This will give you a much\nbetter sense of just how unpredictable the world is. Hindsight may provide\ntemporary comfort to those overwhelmed by complexity, but as for providing\ndeeper revelations about how the world works, you’ll beneﬁt by looking\nelsewhere.\nSee also \nFallacy of the Single Cause\n (ch. 97);\n Falsification of History\n (ch. 78); \nStory\nBias\n (ch. 13); \nForecast Illusion\n (ch. 40); \nOutcome Bias\n (ch. 20); \nSelf-Serving Bias\n (ch.\n45)\n15\nWHY YOU SYSTEMATICALLY OVERESTIMATE YOUR\nKNOWLEDGE AND ABILITIES\nOverconfidence Effect\nMy favourite musician, Johann Sebastian Bach, was anything but a one-hit\nwonder. He composed numerous works. How many there were I will reveal at the\nend of this chapter. But for now, here’s a small assignment: how many concertos\ndo you think Bach composed? Choose a range, for example, between 100 and\n500, aiming for an estimate that is 98% correct and only 2% off.\nHow much conﬁdence should we have in our own knowledge? Psychologists\nHoward Raiffa and Marc Alpert, wondering the same thing, have interviewed\nhundreds of people in this way. They have asked participants to estimate the total\negg production in the U.S., or the number of physicians and surgeons listed in the\nYellow Pages of the phone directory for Boston, or the number of foreign\nautomobiles imported into the U.S., or even the toll collections of the Panama\nCanal in millions of dollars. Subjects could choose any range they liked, with the\naim of not being wrong more than 2% of the time. The results were amazing. In\nthe ﬁnal tally, instead of just 2%, they were off 40% of the time. The researchers\ndubbed this amazing phenomenon \noverconfidence\n.\nOverconfidence\n also applies to forecasts, such as stock market performance\nover a year or your ﬁrm’s proﬁts over three years. We systematically overestimate\nour knowledge and our ability to predict – on a massive scale. The\noverconﬁdence effect\n does not deal with whether single estimates are correct or\nnot. Rather, it measures the difference between what people really know and\nwhat they \nthink\n they know. What’s surprising is this: experts suffer even more from\noverconfidence\n than laypeople do. If asked to forecast oil prices in ﬁve years’\ntime, an economics professor will be as wide of the mark as a zookeeper will.\nHowever, the professor will offer his forecast with certitude.\nOverconfidence\n does not stop at economics: in surveys, 84% of Frenchmen\nestimate that they are above-average lovers. Without the \noverconﬁdence effect\n,\nthat ﬁgure should be exactly 50% – after all, the statistical ‘median’ means 50%\nshould rank higher and 50% should rank lower. In another survey, 93% of the\nU.S. students asked estimated themselves to be ‘above average’ drivers. And\n68% of the faculty at the University of Nebraska rated themselves in the top 25%\nfor teaching ability. Entrepreneurs and those wishing to marry also deem\nthemselves to be different: they believe they can beat the odds. In fact,\nentrepreneurial activity would be a lot lower if \noverconfidence\n did not exist. For\nexample, every restaurateur hopes to establish the next Michelin-starred\nrestaurant, even though statistics show that most close their doors after just three\nyears. The return on investment in the restaurant business lies chronically below\nzero.\nHardly any major projects exist that are completed in less time and at a lower\ncost than forecasted. Some delays and cost overruns are even legendary, such\nas the Airbus A400M, the Sydney Opera House and Boston’s Big Dig.\nThe list\ncan be added to at will. Why is that? Here, two effects act in unison. First, you\nhave classic \noverconfidence\n. Second, those with a direct interest in the project\nhave an incentive to underestimate the costs: consultants, contractors and\nsuppliers seek follow-up orders. Builders feel bolstered by the optimistic ﬁgures\nand, through their activities, politicians get more votes. We will examine this\nstrategic misrepresentation\n (Chapter 89) later in the book.\nWhat makes \noverconfidence\n so prevalent and its effect so confounding is that it\nis not driven by incentives; it is raw and innate. And it’s not counterbalanced by\nthe opposite effect, ‘underconﬁdence’, which doesn’t exist. No surprise to some\nreaders: \noverconfidence\n is more pronounced in men – women tend not to\noverestimate their knowledge and abilities as much. Even more troubling:\noptimists are not the only victims of \noverconfidence\n. Even self-proclaimed\npessimists overrate themselves – just less extremely.\nIn conclusion: be aware that"

This way you have a chance of judging\nthe situation somewhat realistically.\nBack to the question from the beginning: Johann Sebastian Bach composed\n1127 works that survived to this day. He may have composed considerably more,\nbut they are lost.\nSee also \nIllusion of Skill\n (ch. 94); \nForecast Illusion\n (ch. 40); \nStrategic Misrepresentation\n(ch. 89); \nIncentive Super-Response Tendency\n (ch. 18); \nSelf-Serving Bias\n (ch. 45)\n16\nDON’T TAKE NEWS ANCHORS SERIOUSLY\nChauffeur Knowledge\nAfter receiving the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1918, Max Planck went on tour\nacross Germany. Wherever he was invited, he delivered the same lecture on new\nquantum mechanics. Over time, his chauffeur grew to know it by heart: ‘It has to\nbe boring giving the same speech each time, Professor Planck. How about I do it\nfor you in Munich? You can sit in the front row and wear my chauffeur’s cap.\nThat’d give us both a bit of variety.’ Planck liked the idea, so that evening the\ndriver held a long lecture on quantum mechanics in front of a distinguished\naudience. Later, a physics professor stood up with a question. The driver\nrecoiled: ‘Never would I have thought that someone from such an advanced city\nas Munich would ask such a simple question! My chauffeur will answer it.’\nAccording to Charlie Munger, one of the world’s best investors (and from whom\nI have borrowed this story), there are two types of knowledge. First, we have \nreal\nknowledge. We see it in people who have committed a large amount of time and\neffort to understanding a topic. The second type is \nchauffeur knowledge –\nknowledge from people who have learned to put on a show. Maybe they have a\ngreat voice or good hair, but the knowledge they espouse is not their own. They\nreel off eloquent words as if reading from a script.\nUnfortunately, it is increasingly difﬁcult to separate true knowledge from\nchauffeur knowledge\n. With news anchors, however, it is still easy. These are\nactors. Period. Everyone knows it. And yet it continues to astound me how much\nrespect these perfectly-coiffed script readers enjoy, not to mention how much they\nearn moderating panels about topics they barely fathom.\nWith journalists, it is more difﬁcult. Some have acquired true knowledge. Often\nthey are veteran reporters who have specialised for years in a clearly deﬁned\narea. They make a serious effort to understand the complexity of a subject and to\ncommunicate it. They tend to write long articles that highlight a variety of cases\nand exceptions. The majority of journalists, however, fall into the category of\nchauffeur. They conjure up articles off the tops of their heads, or rather, from\nGoogle searches. Their texts are one-sided, short, and – often as compensation\nfor their patchy knowledge – snarky and self-satisfied in tone.\nThe same superﬁciality is present in business. The larger a company, the more\nthe CEO is expected to possess ‘star quality’. Dedication, solemnity, and\nreliability are undervalued, at least at the top. Too often shareholders and\nbusiness journalists seem to believe that showmanship will deliver better results,\nwhich is obviously not the case.\nTo guard against the chauffeur effect, Warren Buffett, Munger’s business\npartner, has coined a wonderful phrase, ‘circle of competence’. What lies inside\nthis circle you understand intuitively; what lies outside, you may only partially\ncomprehend. One of Munger’s best pieces of advice is: ‘You have to stick within\nwhat I call your circle of competence. You have to know what you understand and\nwhat you don’t understand. It’s not terribly important how big the circle is. But it is\nterribly important that you know where the perimeter is.’ Munger underscores this:\n‘So you have to ﬁgure out what your own aptitudes are. If you play games where\nother people have the aptitudes and you don’t, you’re going to lose. And that’s as\nclose to certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to ﬁgure out\nwhere you’ve got an edge. And you’ve got to play within your own circle of\ncompetence.’\nIn conclusion: be on the lookout for \nchauffeur knowledge\n. Do not confuse the\ncompany spokesperson, the ringmaster, the newscaster, the schmoozer, the\nverbiage vendor or the cliché generator with those who possess true knowledge.\nHow do you recognise the difference? There is a clear indicator: true experts\nrecognise the limits of what they know and what they do not know. If they ﬁnd\nthemselves outside their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, ‘I\ndon’t know.’ This they utter unapologetically, even with a certain pride. From\nchauffeurs, we hear every line except this.\nSee also \nAuthority Bias\n (ch. 9);\n Domain Dependence\n (ch. 76); \nTwaddle Tendency\n (ch.\n57)\n17\nYOU CONTROL LESS THAN YOU THINK\nIllusion of Control\nEvery day, shortly before nine o’clock, a man with a red hat stands in a square\nand begins to wave his cap around wildly. After ﬁve minutes he disappears. One\nday, a policeman comes up to him and asks: ‘What are you doing?’ ‘I’m keeping\nthe giraffes away.’ ‘But there aren’t any giraffes here.’ ‘Well, I must be doing a\ngood job, then.’\nA friend with a broken leg was stuck in bed and asked me to pick up a lottery\nticket for him. I went to the store, checked a few boxes, wrote his name on it and\npaid. As I handed him the copy of the ticket, he balked. ‘Why did \nyou\n ﬁll it out? I\nwanted to do that. I’m never going to win anything with your numbers!’\n‘Do you really think it affects the draw if \nyou\n pick the numbers?’ I inquired. He\nlooked at me blankly.\nIn casinos, most people throw the dice as hard as they can if they need a high\nnumber, and as gingerly as possible if they are hoping for a low number – which\nis as nonsensical as football fans thinking they can swing a game by\ngesticulating in front of the TV. Unfortunately they share this illusion with many\npeople who also seek to inﬂuence the world by sending out the ‘right’ thoughts\n(vibrations, positive energy, karma?. . .?).\nThe \nillusion of control\n is the tendency to believe that we can inﬂuence\nsomething over which we have absolutely no sway. This was discovered in 1965\nby two researchers, Jenkins and Ward. Their experiment was simple, consisting\nof just two switches and a light. The men were able to adjust when the switches\nconnected to the light and when not. Even when the light ﬂashed on and off at\nrandom, subjects were still convinced that they could inﬂuence it by ﬂicking the\nswitches.\nOr consider this example: an American researc"

The same\ngoes for pronouncements made by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve; markets\nmove, even though these statements inject little of tangible value into the real\neconomy. They are merely sound waves. And still we allow economic heads to\ncontinue to play with the illusory dials. It would be a real wake-up call if all\ninvolved realised the truth – that the world economy is a fundamentally\nuncontrollable system.\nAnd you? Do you have everything under control? Probably less than you think.\nDo not think you command your way through life like a Roman emperor. Rather,\nyou are the man with the red hat. Therefore, focus on the few things of importance\nthat you can really influence. For everything else: \nque sera, sera\n.\nSee also \nCoincidence\n (ch. 24);\n Neglect of Probability\n (ch. 26);\n Forecast Illusion\n (ch. 40);\nIllusion of Skill\n (ch. 94); \nClustering Illusion\n (ch. 3); \nIntrospection Illusion\n (ch. 67)\n\n18\nNEVER PAY YOUR LAWYER BY THE HOUR\nIncentive Super-Response Tendency\nTo control a rat infestation, French colonial rulers in Hanoi in the nineteenth\ncentury passed a law: for every dead rat handed in to the authorities, the catcher\nwould receive a reward. Yes, many rats were destroyed, but many were also bred\nspecially for this purpose.\nIn 1947, when the Dead Sea scrolls were discovered, archaeologists set a\nﬁnder’s fee for each new parchment. Instead of lots of extra scrolls being found,\nthey were simply torn apart to increase the reward. Similarly, in China in the\nnineteenth century, an incentive was offered for ﬁnding dinosaur bones. Farmers\nlocated a few on their land, broke them into pieces and cashed in. Modern\nincentives are no better: company boards promise bonuses for achieved targets.\nAnd what happens? Managers invest more energy in trying to lower the targets\nthan in growing the business.\nThese are examples of the \nincentive super-response tendency\n. Credited to\nCharlie Munger, this titanic name describes a rather trivial observation: people\nrespond to incentives by doing what is in their best interests. What is noteworthy\nis, ﬁrst, how quickly and radically people’s behaviour changes when incentives\ncome into play or are altered and, second, the fact that people respond to the\nincentives themselves and not the grander intentions behind them.\nGood incentive systems comprise both intent and reward. An example: in\nAncient Rome, engineers were made to stand \nunderneath \nthe construction at\ntheir bridges’ opening ceremonies. Poor incentive systems, on the other hand,\noverlook and sometimes even pervert the underlying aim. For example, censoring\na book makes its contents more famous and rewarding bank employees for each\nloan sold leads to a miserable credit portfolio. Making CEOs’ pay public didn’t\ndampen the astronomical salaries; to the contrary, it pushed them upward.\nNobody wants to be the loser CEO in his industry.\nDo you want to inﬂuence the behaviour of people or organisations? You could\nalways preach about values and visions, or you could appeal to reason. But in\nnearly every case, incentives work better. These need not be monetary; anything\nis useable, from good grades to Nobel Prizes to special treatment in the afterlife.\nFor a long time I tried to understand what made well-educated nobles from the\nMiddle Ages bid adieu to their comfortable lives, swing themselves up on to\nhorses and take part in the Crusades. They were well aware that the arduous ride\nto Jerusalem lasted at least six months and passed directly through enemy\nterritory, yet they took the risk. And then it came to me: the answer lies in incentive\nsystems. If they came back alive, they could keep the spoils of war and live out\ntheir days as rich men. If they died, they automatically passed on to the afterlife as\nmartyrs – with all the benefits that came with it. It was win-win.\nImagine for a moment that, instead of demanding enemies’ riches, warriors and\nsoldiers charged by the hour. We would effectively be incentivising them to take\nas long as possible, right? So why do we do just this with lawyers, architects,\nconsultants, accountants and driving instructors? My advice: forget hourly rates\nand always negotiate a fixed price in advance.\nBe wary, too, of investment advisers endorsing particular ﬁnancial products.\nThey are not interested in your ﬁnancial well-being, but in earning a commission\non these products. The same goes for entrepreneurs’ and investment bankers’\nbusiness plans. These are often worthless because, again, the vendors have\ntheir own interests at heart. What is the old adage? ‘Never ask a barber if you\nneed a haircut.’\nIn conclusion: keep an eye out for the \nincentive super-response tendency\n. If a\nperson’s or an organisation’s behaviour confounds you, ask yourself what\nincentive might lie behind it. I guarantee you that you’ll be able to explain 90% of\nthe cases this way. What makes up the remaining 10%? Passion, idiocy,\npsychosis or malice.\nSee also \nMotivation Crowding\n (ch. 56);\n Reciprocity\n (ch. 6); \nOverconfidence Effect\n (ch.\n15); \nMotivation Crowding\n (ch. 56)\n19\nTHE DUBIOUS EFFICACY OF DOCTORS, CONSULTANTS AND\nPSYCHOTHERAPISTS\nRegression to Mean\nHis back pain was sometimes better, sometimes worse. There were days when\nhe felt like he could move mountains, and those when he could barely move.\nWhen that was the case – fortunately it happened only rarely – his wife would\ndrive him to the chiropractor. The next day he would feel much more mobile and\nwould recommend the therapist to everyone.\nAnother man, younger and with a respectable golf handicap of 12, gushed in a\nsimilar fashion about his golf instructor. Whenever he played miserably, he\nbooked an hour with the pro, and lo and behold, in the next game he fared much\nbetter.\nA third man, an investment adviser at a major bank, invented a sort of ‘rain\ndance’, which he performed in the restroom every time his stocks had performed\nextremely badly. As absurd as it seemed, he felt compelled to do it: and things\nalways improved afterward.\nWhat links the three men is a fallacy: the \nregression-to-mean\n delusion.\nSuppose your region is experiencing a record period of cold weather. In all\nprobability, the temperature will rise in the next few days, back toward the monthly\naverage. The same goes for extreme heat, drought or rain. Weather ﬂuctuates\naround a mean. The same is true for chronic pain, golf handicaps, stock market\nperformance, luck in love, subjective happiness and test scores. In short, the\ncrippling back pain would most likely have improved without a chiropractor. The\nhandicap would have returned to 12 without additional lessons. And the\nperformance of the investment adviser would also have shifted back toward the\nmarket average – with or without the restroom dance.\nExtreme performances are interspersed with less extreme ones. The most\nsuccessful stock picks from the past three years are hardly going to be the most\nsuccessful stocks in the coming three years. Knowing this, you can appreciate\nwhy some athletes would rather not make it on to the front pages of the\nnewspapers: subconsciously they know that the next time they race, they\nprobably won’t achieve the same top result – which has nothing to do with the\nmedia attention, but is to do with natural variations in performance.\nOr, take the example of a division manager who wants to improve employee\nmorale by sending the least motivated 3% of the workforce on a course. The\nresult? The next time he looks at motivation levels, the same people will not make\nup the bottom few – there will be others. Was the course worth it? Hard to say,\nsince the group’s motivation levels would probably have returned to their\npersonal norms even without the training. The situation is similar with patients\nwho are hospitalised for depression. They usually leave the clinic feeling a little\nbetter. It is quite possible, however, that the stay contributed absolutely nothing.\nAnother example: in Boston, the lowest-performing schools were entered into a\ncomplex support programme. The following year, the schools had moved up in\nthe rankings, an improvement that the authorities attributed to the programme\nrather than to natural \nregression to mean\n.\nIgnoring \nregression to mean\n can have destructive consequences, such as\nteachers (or managers) concluding that the stick is better than the carrot.

They\nbuy and sell stocks like crazy and, of course, completely at random. What\nhappens? After one week, about half of the monkeys will have made a proﬁt and\nthe other half a loss. The ones that made a proﬁt can stay; the ones that made a\nloss you send home. In the second week, one half of the monkeys will still be\nriding high, while the other half will have made a loss and are sent home. And so\non. After ten weeks, about 1,000 monkeys will be left – those who have always\ninvested their money well. After twenty weeks, just one monkey will remain – this\none always, without fail, chose the right stocks and is now a billionaire. Let’s call\nhim the success monkey.\nHow does the media react? They will pounce on this animal to understand its\n‘success principles’. And they will ﬁnd some: perhaps the monkey eats more\nbananas than the others. Perhaps he sits in another corner of the cage. Or,\nmaybe he swings headlong through the branches, or he takes long, reﬂective\npauses while grooming. He must have some recipe for success, right? How else\ncould he perform so brilliantly? Spot-on for twenty weeks – and that from a simple\nmonkey? Impossible!\nThe monkey story illustrates the \noutcome bias\n: we tend to evaluate decisions\nbased on the result rather than on the decision process. This fallacy is also\nknown as the \nhistorian error\n. A classic example is the Japanese attack on Pearl\nHarbor. Should the military base have been evacuated or not? From today’s\nperspective: obviously, for there was plenty of evidence that an attack was\nimminent. However, only in retrospect do the signals appear so clear. At the time,\nin 1941, there was a plethora of contradictory signals. Some pointed to an attack;\nothers did not. To assess the quality of the decision, we must use the information\navailable at the time, ﬁltering out everything we know about it post-attack\n(particularly that it did indeed take place).\nAnother experiment: you must evaluate the performance of three heart\nsurgeons. To do this, you ask each to carry out a difﬁcult operation ﬁve times.\nOver the years, the probability of dying from these procedures has stabilised at\n20%. With surgeon A, no one dies. With surgeon B, one patient dies. With\nsurgeon C, two die. How do you rate the performance of A, B and C? If you think\nlike most people, you rate A the best, B the second best, and C the worst. And\nthus you’ve just fallen for the \noutcome bias\n. You can guess why: the samples are\ntoo small, rendering the results meaningless. You can only really judge a surgeon\nif you know something about the ﬁeld, and then carefully monitor the preparation\nand execution of the operation. In other words, you assess the process and not\nthe result. Alternatively, you could employ a larger sample, if you have enough\npatients who need this particular operation: 100 or 1,000 operations. For now it is\nenough to know that, with an average surgeon, there is a 33% chance that no one\nwill die, a 41% chance that one person will die and a 20% chance that two people\nwill die. That’s a simple probability calculation. What stands out: there is no huge\ndifference between zero dead and two dead. To assess the three surgeons purely\non the basis of the outcomes would be not only negligent but also unethical.\nIn conclusion: never judge a decision purely by its result, especially when\nrandomness or ‘external factors’ play a role. A bad result does not automatically\nindicate a bad decision and vice versa. So rather than tearing your hair out about\na wrong decision, or applauding yourself for one that may have only\ncoincidentally led to success, remember why you chose what you did. Were your\nreasons rational and understandable? Then you would do well to stick with that\nmethod, even if you didn’t strike lucky last time.\nSee also \nSunk Cost Fallacy\n (ch. 5);\n Swimmer’s Body Illusion\n (ch. 2); \nHindsight Bias\n(ch. 14); \nIllusion of Skill\n (ch. 94)\n21\nLESS IS MORE\nThe Paradox of Choice\nMy sister and her husband bought an unﬁnished house a little while ago. Since\nthen, we haven’t been able to talk about anything else. The sole topic of\nconversation for the past two months has been bathroom tiles: ceramic, granite,\nmarble, metal, stone, wood, glass and every type of laminate known to man.\nRarely have I seen my sister in such anguish. ‘There are just too many to choose\nfrom,’ she exclaims, throwing her hands in the air and returning to the tile\ncatalogue, her constant companion.\nI’ve counted and researched: my local grocery store stocks 48 varieties of\nyogurt, 134 types of red wine, 64 different cleaning products and a grand total of\n30,000 items. Amazon, the Internet bookseller, has two million titles available.\nNowadays, people are bombarded with options, such as hundreds of mental\ndisorders, thousands of different careers, even more holiday destinations and an\ninfinite variety of lifestyles. There has never been more choice.\nWhen I was young, we had three types of yogurt, three television channels, two\nchurches, two kinds of cheese (mild or strong), one type of ﬁsh (trout) and one\ntelephone, provided by the Swiss Post. The black box with the dial served no\nother purpose than making calls, and that did us just ﬁne. In contrast, anyone who\nenters a phone store today runs the risk of being ﬂattened by an avalanche of\nbrands, models and contract options.\nAnd yet, selection is the yardstick of progress. It is what sets us apart from\nplanned economies and the Stone Age. Yes, abundance makes you giddy, but\nthere is a limit. When it is exceeded, a surfeit of choices destroys quality of life.\nThe technical term for this is the\n paradox of choice\n.\nIn his book of the same title, psychologist Barry Schwartz describes why this is\nso. First, a large selection leads to inner paralysis. To test this, a supermarket set\nup a stand where customers could sample twenty-four varieties of jelly. They\ncould try as many as they liked and then buy them at a discount. The next day,\nthe owners carried out the same experiment with only six ﬂavours. The result?\nThey sold ten times more jelly on day two. Why? With such a wide range,\ncustomers could not come to a decision, so they bought nothing. The experiment\nwas repeated several times with different products. The results were always the\nsame.\nSecond, a broader selection leads to poorer decisions. If you ask young people\nwhat is important in a life partner, they reel off all the usual qualities: intelligence,\ngood manners, warmth, the ability to listen, a sense of humour and physical\nattractiveness. But do they actually take these criteria into account when\nchoosing someone? In the past, a young man from a village of average size could\nchoose among maybe twenty girls of similar age with whom he went to school.\nHe knew their families and vice versa, leading to a decision based on several\nwell-known attributes. Nowadays, in the era of online dating, millions of potential\npartners are at our disposal. It has been proven that the stress caused by this\nmind-boggling variety is so large that the male brain reduces the decision to one\nsingle criterion: physical attractiveness. The consequences of this selection\nprocess you already know – perhaps even from personal experience.\nFinally, large selection leads to discontent. How can you be sure you are\nmaking the right choice when 200 options surround and confound you? The\nanswer is: you cannot. The more choice you have, the more unsure and therefore\ndissatisfied you are afterward.\nSo, what can you do? Think carefully about what you want before you inspect\nexisting offers. Write down these criteria and stick to them rigidly. Also, realise\nthat you c"

Yes, even in terms of life partners. Only the best will do? In this age of\nunlimited variety, rather the opposite is true: ‘good enough’ is the new optimum\n(except, of course, for you and me).\nSee also \nDecision Fatigue\n (ch. 53); \nAlternative Blindness\n (ch. 71); \nDefault Effect\n (ch. 81)\n22\nYOU LIKE ME, YOU REALLY REALLY LIKE ME\nLiking Bias\nKevin has just bought two boxes of ﬁne Margaux. He rarely drinks wine – not\neven Bordeaux – but the sales assistant was so nice, not fake or pushy, just really\nlikeable. So he bought them.\nJoe Girard is considered the most successful car salesman in the world. His tip\nfor success: ‘There’s nothing more effective in selling anything than getting the\ncustomer to believe, really believe, that you like him and care about him.’\nGirard\ndoesn’t just talk the talk: his secret weapon is sending a card to his customers\neach month. Just one sentence salutes them: ‘I like you.’\nThe \nliking bias\n is startlingly simple to understand and yet we continually fall\nprey to it. It means this: the more we like someone, the more inclined we are to\nbuy from or help that person. Still, the question remains: what does ‘likeable’\neven mean? According to research, we see people as pleasant if A) they are\noutwardly attractive, B) they are similar to us in terms of origin, personality or\ninterests, and C) they like us. Consequently, advertising is full of attractive\npeople. Ugly people seem unfriendly and don’t even make it into the background\n(see A). In addition to engaging super-attractive types, advertising also employs\n‘people like you and me’ (see B) – those who are similar in appearance, accent or\nbackground. In short, the more similar the better. Mirroring is a standard technique\nin sales to get exactly this effect. Here, the salesperson tries to copy the gestures,\nlanguage, and facial expressions of his prospective client. If the buyer speaks\nvery slowly and quietly, often scratching his head, it makes sense for the seller to\nspeak slowly and quietly, and to scratch his head now and then too. That makes\nhim likeable in the eyes of the buyer, and thus a business deal is more likely.\nFinally, it’s not unheard of for advertisers to pay us compliments: how many times\nhave you bought something ‘because you’re worth it’? Here factor C comes into\nplay: we ﬁnd people appealing if they like us. Compliments work wonders, even if\nthey ring hollow as a drum.\nSo-called multilevel marketing (selling through personal networks) works solely\nbecause of the \nliking bias\n. Though there are excellent plastic containers in the\nsupermarket for a quarter of the price, Tupperware generates an annual turnover\nof two billion dollars. Why? The friends who hold the Tupperware parties meet\nthe second and third congeniality standard perfectly.\nAid agencies employ the \nliking bias\n to great effect. Their campaigns use\nbeaming children or women almost exclusively. Never will you see a stone-faced,\nwounded guerrilla ﬁghter staring at you from billboards – even though he also\nneeds your support. Conservation organisations also carefully select who gets\nthe starring role in their advertisements. Have you ever seen a World Wildlife\nFund brochure ﬁlled with spiders, worms, algae or bacteria? They are perhaps\njust as endangered as pandas, gorillas, koalas and seals – and even more\nimportant for the ecosystem. But we feel nothing for them. The more human a\ncreature acts, the more similar it is to us, the more we like it. The bone skipper ﬂy\nis extinct? Too bad.\nPoliticians, too, are maestros of the \nliking bias\n. Depending on the make-up and\ninterests of an audience, they emphasise different topics, such as residential\narea, social background or economic issues. And they ﬂatter us: Each potential\nvoter is made to feel like an indispensable member of the team: ‘Your vote\ncounts!’ Of course your vote counts, but only by the tiniest of fractions, bordering\non the irrelevant.\nA friend who deals in oil pumps told me how he once closed an eight-ﬁgure\ndeal for a pipeline in Russia. ‘Bribery?’ I inquired. He shook his head. ‘We were\nchatting, and suddenly we got on to the topic of sailing. It turned out that both of\nus – the buyer and me – were die-hard 470 dinghy fans. From that moment on, he\nliked me; I was a friend. So the deal was sealed. Amiability works better than\nbribery.’\nSo, if you are a salesperson, make buyers think you like them, even if this\nmeans outright ﬂattery. And if you are a consumer, always judge a product\nindependent of who is selling it. Banish the salespeople from your mind, or rather,\npretend you don’t like them.\nSee also \nReciprocity\n (ch. 6);\n Personification\n (ch. 87)\n23\nDON’T CLING TO THINGS\nEndowment Effect\nThe BMW gleamed in the parking lot of the used-car dealership. Although it had a\nfew miles on the odometer, it looked in perfect condition. I know a little about used\ncars, and to me it was worth around $40,000. However, the salesman was\npushing for $50,000 and wouldn’t budge a dime. When he called the next week to\nsay he would accept $40,000 after all, I went for it. The next day, I took it out for a\nspin and stopped at a gas station. The owner came out to admire the car – and\nproceeded to offer me $53,000 in cash on the spot. I politely declined. Only on the\nway home did I realise how ridiculous I was to have said no. Something that I\nconsidered worth $40,000 had passed into my possession and suddenly taken\non a value of more than $53,000. If I were thinking purely rationally, I would have\nsold the car immediately. But, alas, I’d fallen under the inﬂuence of the\nendowment effect\n. We consider things to be more valuable the moment we own\nthem. In other words, if we are selling something, we charge more for it than what\nwe ourselves would be willing to spend.\nTo probe this, psychologist Dan Ariely conducted the following experiment: in\none of his classes, he rafﬂed tickets to a major basketball game, then polled the\nstudents to see how much they thought the tickets were worth. The empty-handed\nstudents estimated around $170, whereas the winning students would not sell\ntheir ticket below an average of $2,400. The simple fact of ownership makes us\nadd zeros to the selling price.\nIn real estate, the \nendowment effect\n is palpable. Sellers become emotionally\nattached to their houses and thus systematically overestimate their value. They\nbalk at the market price, expecting buyers to pay more – which is completely\nabsurd since this excess is little more than sentimental value.\nRichard Thaler performed an interesting classroom experiment at Cornell\nUniversity to measure the \nendowment effect\n. He distributed coffee mugs to half of\nthe students and told them they could either take the mug home or sell it at a price\nthey could specify. The other half of the students, who didn’t get a mug, were\nasked how much they would be willing to pay for a mug. In other words, Thaler\nset up a market for coffee mugs. One would expect that roughly 50% of the\nstudents would be willing to trade – to either sell or buy a mug. But the result was\nmuch lower than that. Why? Because the average owner would not sell below\n$5.25, and the average buyer would not pay more than $2.25 for a mug.\nWe can safely say that we are better at collecting things than at casting them\noff. Not only does this explain why we ﬁll our homes with junk, but also why\nlovers of stamps, watches and pieces of art part with them so seldomly.\nAmazingly, the \nendowment effect\n affects not only possession but also near-\nownership. Auction houses like Christie’s and Sotheby’s thrive on this. A person\nwho bids until the end of an auction gets the feeling that the object is practically\ntheirs, thus increasing its value. The would-be owner is suddenly willing to pay\nmuch more than planned, and any withdrawal from the bidding is perceived as a\nloss – which deﬁes all logic. In large auctions, such as those for mining rights or\nmobile radio frequencies, we often observe the \nwinner’s curse\n: here, the\nsuccessful bidder turns out to be the economic loser when he gets caught up in\nthe fervour and overbids. I’ll offer more insight on the \nwinner’s curse\n in chapter\n35.\nThere’s a similar effect in the job market. If you are applying for a job and don’t\nget a call back, you have every reason to be disappointed. However, if you make\nit to the ﬁnal "

For various reasons, they were\nall running behind. The minister’s family was delayed because his wife still had to\niron their daughter’s dress. One couple was held back when their car wouldn’t\nstart. The pianist wanted to be there 30 minutes early, but he fell into a deep\nsleep after dinner. And so on. At 7.25p.m., the church exploded. The blast was\nheard all around the village. It blew out the walls and sent the roof crashing to the\nground. Miraculously, nobody was killed. The ﬁre chief traced the explosion back\nto a gas leak, even though members of the choir were convinced they had\nreceived a sign from God.

But,\ntelepathy or \ncoincidence\n?\nOn 5 October 1990, the \nSan Francisco Examiner\n reported that Intel would take\nits rival, AMD, to court. Intel found out that the company was planning to launch a\ncomputer chip named AM386, a term which clearly referred to Intel’s 386 chip.\nHow Intel came upon the information is remarkable: by pure coincidence, both\ncompanies had hired someone named Mike Webb. Both men were staying in the\nsame hotel in California, and checked out on the same day. After they had left, the\nhotel accepted a package for Mike Webb at reception. It contained conﬁdential\ndocuments about the AM386 chip, and the hotel mistakenly sent it to Mike Webb\nof Intel, who promptly forwarded the contents to the legal department.\nHow likely are stories like that? The Swiss psychiatrist C.G. Jung saw in them\nthe work of an unknown force, which he called synchronicity. But how should a\nrationally minded thinker approach these accounts? Preferably with a piece of\npaper and a pencil. Consider the ﬁrst case, the explosion of the church. Draw four\nboxes to represent each of the potential events. The ﬁrst possibility is what\nactually took place: ‘choir delayed and church exploded.’ But there are three\nother options: ‘choir delayed and church did not explode,’ ‘choir on time and\nchurch exploded’ and ‘choir on time and church did not explode.’ Estimate the\nfrequencies of these events and write them in the corresponding box. Pay special\nattention to how often the last case has happened: every day, millions of choirs\ngather for scheduled rehearsals and their churches don’t blow up. Suddenly, the\nstory has lost its unimaginable quality. For all these millions of churches, it would\nbe improbable if something like what happened in Beatrice, Nebraska didn’t take\nplace at least once a century. So, no: no hand of God. (And anyway, why would\nGod want to blow a church to smithereens? What a ridiculous way to\ncommunicate with your worshippers!)\nLet’s apply the same thinking to the phone call. Keep in mind the many\noccasions when ‘Andy’ thinks of you but doesn’t call; when you think of him and\nhe doesn’t call; when you don’t think of him and he calls; when he doesn’t think of\nyou and you call?. . .?There is an almost inﬁnite number of occasions when you\ndon’t think of him and he doesn’t call. But, since people spend about 90% of their\ntime thinking about others, it is not unlikely that, eventually, two people will think\nof each other and one of them will pick up the phone. And it must not be just\nAndy: if you have 100 other friends, the probability of this happening increases\ngreatly.\nWe tend to stumble when estimating probabilities. If someone says ‘never’, I\nusually register this as a minuscule probability greater than zero, since ‘never’\ncannot be compensated by a negative probability.\nIn sum: let’s not get too excited. Improbable coincidences are precisely that:\nrare but very possible events. It’s not surprising when they ﬁnally happen. What\nwould be more surprising would be if they never came to be.\nSee also \nFalse Causality\n (ch.37);\n Confirmation Bias \n(chs. 7–8)\n;\n Regression to Mean\n (ch.\n19);\n Illusion of Control\n (ch. 17); \nClustering Illusion\n (ch. 3)\n25\nTHE CALAMITY OF CONFORMITY\nGroupthink\nHave you ever bitten your tongue in a meeting? Surely. You sit there, say nothing\nand nod along to proposals. After all, you don’t want to be the (eternal) naysayer.\nMoreover, you might not be 100% sure why you disagree, whereas the others are\nunanimous – and far from stupid. So you keep your mouth shut for another day.\nWhen everyone thinks and acts like this, \ngroupthink \nis at work: this is where a\ngroup of smart people makes reckless decisions because everyone aligns their\nopinions with the supposed consensus. Thus, motions are passed that each\nindividual group member would have rejected if no peer pressure had been\ninvolved. \nGroupthink\n is a special branch of \nsocial proof\n, a ﬂaw that we discussed\nin chapter 4.\nIn March 1960, the U.S. Secret Service began to mobilise anti-communist\nexiles from Cuba, most of them living in Miami, to use against Fidel Castro’s\nregime. In January 1961, two days after taking ofﬁce, President Kennedy was\ninformed about the secret plan to invade Cuba. Three months later, a key meeting\ntook place at the White House in which Kennedy and his advisers all voted in\nfavour of the invasion. On 17 April 1961, a brigade of 1,400 exiled Cubans landed\nat the Bay of Pigs, on Cuba’s south coast, with the help of the U.S. Navy, the Air\nForce and the CIA. The aim was to overthrow Castro’s government. However,\nnothing went as planned. On the ﬁrst day, not a single supply ship reached the\ncoast. The Cuban air force sank the ﬁrst two and the next two turned around and\nﬂed back to the U.S. A day later, Castro’s army completely surrounded the\nbrigade. On the third day, the 1,200 survivors were taken into custody and sent to\nmilitary prisons. Kennedy’s invasion of the Bay of Pigs is regarded as one of the\nbiggest ﬂops in American foreign policy. That such an absurd plan was ever\nagreed upon, never mind put into action, is astounding. All of the assumptions\nthat spoke in favour of invasion were erroneous. For example, Kennedy’s team\ncompletely underestimated the strength of Cuba’s air force. Also, it was expected\nthat, in an emergency, the brigade would be able to hide in the Escambray\nmountains and carry out an underground war against Castro from there. A glance\nat the map shows that the refuge was 100 miles away from the Bay of Pigs, with\nan insurmountable swamp in between. And yet, Kennedy and his advisers were\namong the most intelligent people to ever run an American government. What\nwent wrong between January and April of 1961?\nPsychology professor Irving Janis has studied many ﬁascos. He concluded that\nthey share the following pattern: members of a close-knit group cultivate team\nspirit by (unconsciously) building illusions. One of these fantasies is a belief in\ninvincibility: ‘If both our leader [in this case, Kennedy] and the group are conﬁdent\nthat the plan will work, then luck will be on our side.’ Next comes the illusion of\nunanimity: if the others are of the same opinion, any dissenting view must be\nwrong. No one wants to be the naysayer who destroys team unity. Finally, each\nperson is happy to be part of the group. Expressing reservations could mean\nexclusion from it. In our evolutionary past, such banishment guaranteed death;\nhence our strong urge to remain in the group’s favour.\nThe business world\n \nis no stranger to\n groupthink\n. A classic example is the fate\nof the world-class airline Swissair. Here, a group of highly paid consultants rallied\naround the former CEO and, bolstered by the euphoria of past successes,\ndeveloped a high-risk expansion strategy ("

Which do you play? If you win the ﬁrst game, it changes your life\ncompletely: you can quit your job, tell your boss where to go and live off the\nwinnings. If you hit the jackpot in the second game, you can take a nice vacation\nin the Caribbean, but you’ll be back at your desk quick enough to see your\npostcard arrive. The probability of winning is one in 100 million in the ﬁrst game,\nand one in 10,000 in the second game. So which do you choose?\nOur emotions draw us to the ﬁrst game, even though the second is ten times\nbetter, objectively considered (expected win times probability). Therefore, the\ntrend is towards ever-larger jackpots – Mega Millions, Mega Billions, Mega\nTrillions – no matter how small the odds are.\nIn a classic experiment from 1972, participants were divided into two groups.\nThe members of the ﬁrst group were told that they would receive a small electric\nshock. In the second group, subjects were told that the risk of this happening was\nonly 50%. The researchers measured physical anxiety (heart rate, nervousness,\nsweating, etc.) shortly before commencing. The result were, well, shocking: there\nwas absolutely no difference. Participants in both groups were equally stressed.\nNext, the researchers announced a series of reductions in the probability of a\nshock for the second group: from 50% to 20%, then 10%, then 5%. The result: still\nno difference! However, when they declared they would increase the \nstrength\n of\nthe expected current, both groups’ anxiety levels rose – again, by the same\ndegree. This illustrates that we respond to the expected \nmagnitude\n of an event\n(the size of the jackpot or the amount of electricity), but not to its \nlikelihood\n. In\nother words: we lack an intuitive grasp of probability.\nThe proper term for this is \nneglect of probability,\n and it leads to errors in\ndecision-making. We invest in start-ups because the potential proﬁt makes dollar\nsigns ﬂash before our eyes, but we forget (or are too lazy) to investigate the slim\nchances of new businesses actually achieving such growth. Similarly, following\nextensive media coverage of a plane crash, we cancel ﬂights without really\nconsidering the minuscule probability of crashing (which, of course, remains the\nsame before and after such a disaster). Many amateur investors compare their\ninvestments solely on the basis of yield. For them, Google shares with a return of\n20% must be twice as good as property that returns 10%. That’s wrong. It would\nbe a lot smarter to also consider both investments’ risks. But then again, we have\nno natural feel for this so we often turn a blind eye to it.\nBack to the experiment with the electric shocks: in group B, the probability of\ngetting a jolt was further reduced: from 5% to 4% to 3%. Only when the probability\nreached zero did group B respond differently to group A. To us, 0% risk seems\ninfinitely better than a (highly improbable) 1% risk.\nTo test this, let’s examine two methods of treating drinking water. Suppose a\nriver has two equally large tributaries. One is treated using method A, which\nreduces the risk of dying from contaminated water from 5% to 2%. The other is\ntreated using method B, which reduces the risk from 1% to 0%, i.e. the threat is\ncompletely eliminated. So, method A or B? If you think like most people, you will\nopt for method B – which is silly because with measure A, 3% fewer people die,\nand with B, just 1% fewer. Method A is three times as good! This fallacy is called\nthe \nzero-risk bias\n.\nA classic example of this is the U.S. Food Act of 1958, which prohibits food that\ncontains cancer-causing substances. Instituted to achieve zero risk of cancer, this\nban sounds good at ﬁrst, but it ended up leading to the use of more dangerous\n(but non-carcinogenic) food additives. It is also absurd: as Paracelsus illustrated\nin the sixteenth century, poisoning is always a question of dosage. Furthermore,\nthis law can never be enforced properly since it is impossible to remove the last\n‘banned’ molecule from food. Each farm would have to function like a hyper-\nsterile computer-chip factory, and the cost of food would increase a hundredfold.\nEconomically, zero risk rarely makes sense. One exception is when the\nconsequences are colossal, such as a deadly, highly contagious virus escaping\nfrom a biotech laboratory.\nWe have no intuitive grasp of risk and thus distinguish poorly between different\nthreats. The more serious the threat and the more emotional the topic (such as\nradioactivity), the less reassuring a reduction in risk seems to us. Two\nresearchers at the University of Chicago have shown that people are equally\nafraid of a 99% chance as they are of a 1% chance of conta"

We sat trying to make conversation while her three\nchildren grappled with one another on the ﬂoor. Suddenly I remembered that I\nhad brought some glass marbles with me – a whole bag full. I spilled them out on\nthe ﬂoor, in the hope that the little angels would play with them in peace. Far from\nit: a heated argument ensued. I didn’t understand what was happening until I\nlooked more closely. Among the countless marbles there was just one blue one,\nand the children scrambled for it. All the marbles were exactly the same size and\nshiny and bright. But the blue one had an advantage over the others – it was one\nof a kind. I had to laugh at how childish children are!\nIn August 2005, when I heard that Google would launch its own email service, I\nwas dead set on getting an account. (In the end I did.)

Looking back, I\nhave to laugh at how childish adults are!\nRara sunt cara\n, said the Romans. Rare is valuable. In fact, the \nscarcity error\n is\nas old as mankind. My friend with the three children is a part-time real-estate\nagent. Whenever she has an interested buyer who cannot decide, she calls and\nsays ‘A doctor from London saw the plot of land yesterday. He liked it a lot. What\nabout you? Are you still interested?’ The doctor from London – sometimes it’s a\nprofessor or a banker – is, of course, ﬁctitious. The effect is very real, though: it\ncauses prospects to see the opportunity disappearing before their eyes, so they\nact and close the deal. Why? This is the potential shortage of supply, yet again.\nObjectively, this situation is incomprehensible: either the prospect wants the land\nfor the set price or he does not – regardless of any doctors from London.\nTo assess the quality of cookies, Professor Stephen Worchel split participants\ninto two groups.

That Mark is A) a truck driver or B) a professor of literature\nin Frankfurt. Most will bet on B, which is wrong. Germany has 10,000 times more\ntruck drivers than Frankfurt has literature professors. Therefore, it is more likely\nthat Mark is a truck driver. So what just happened? The detailed description\nenticed us to overlook the statistical reality. Scientists call this fallacy \nbase-rate\nneglect\n: a disregard of fundamental distribution levels. It is one of the most\ncommon errors in reasoning. Virtually all journalists, economists and politicians\nfall for it on a regular basis.\nHere is a second example: a young man is stabbed and fatally injured. Which\nof these is more likely? A) The attacker is a Russian immigrant and imports\ncombat knives illegally, or B) the attacker is a middle-class American. You know\nthe drill now: option B is much more likely because there are a million times more\nmiddle-class Americans than there are Russian knife importers.\nIn medicine, \nbase-rate neglect\n plays an important role. For example, migraines\ncan point (among others) to a viral infection or a brain tumour. However, viral\ninfections are much more common (in other words, they have a higher base rate),\nso doctors assess patients for these ﬁrst before testing for tumours. This is very\nreasonable. In medical school, residents spend a lot of time purging \nbase-rate\nneglect\n. The motto drummed into any prospective doctor in the United States is:\n‘When you hear hoofbeats behind you, don’t expect to see a zebra.’ Which\nmeans: investigate the most likely ailments before you start diagnosing exotic\ndiseases, even if you are a specialist in that.\nDoctors are the only professionals who enjoy this base-rate training.\nRegrettably, few people in business are exposed to it. Now and then I see high-\nﬂying entrepreneurs’ business plans and get very excited by their products, ideas\nand personalities. I often catch myself thinking: this could be the next Google! But\na glance at the base rate brings me back down to earth. The probability that a ﬁrm\nwill survive the ﬁrst ﬁve years is 20%. So what then is the probability that they will\ngrow into a global corporation? Almost zero. Warren Buffett once explained why\nhe does not invest in biotech companies: ‘How many of these companies make a\nturnover of several hundred million dollars? It simply does not happen?. . .?The\nmost likely scenario is that these ﬁrms will just hover somewhere in the middle.’\nThis is clear base-rate thinking. For most people, \nsurvivorship bias\n (chapter 1) is\none of the causes for their \nbase-rate neglect\n. They tend to see only the successful\nindividuals and companies, because the unsuccessful cases are not reported (or\nare under-reported). This makes them neglect the large part of the ‘invisible’\ncases.\nImagine you are sampling wine in a restaurant and have to guess from which\ncountry it comes. The label of the bottle is covered. If, like me, you are not a wine\nconnoisseur, the only lifeline you have is the base rate. You know from\nexperience that about three-quarters of the wines on the menu are of French\norigin, so reasonably, you guess France, even if you suspect a Chilean or\nCalifornian twist.\nSometimes I have the dubious honour of speaking in front of students of elite\nbusiness schools. When I ask them about their career prospects, most answer\nthat in the medium term, they see themselves on the boards of global companies.\nYears ago, both my fellow students and I gave the same answer. The way I see it,\nmy role is to give students a base-rate crash course: ‘With a degree from this\nschool, the chance of you landing a spot on the board of a Fortune 500 company\nis less than 0.1%. No matter how smart and ambitious you are, the most likely\nscenario is that you will end up in middle management.’ With this, I earn shocked\nlooks, and tell myself that I have made a small contribution toward mitigating their\nfuture mid-life crises.\nSee also \nSurvivorship Bias\n (ch. 1); \nNeglect of Probability\n (ch. 26); \nGambler’s Fallacy\n(ch. 29); \nConjunction Fallacy\n (ch. 41); \nThe Problem with Averages\n (ch. 55); \nInformation\nBias\n (ch. 59); \nAmbiguity Aversion\n (ch. 80)\n29\nWHY THE ‘BALANCING FORCE OF THE UNIVERSE’ IS\nBALONEY\nGambler’s Fallacy\nIn the summer of 1913, something incredible happened in Monte Carlo.

Now that you’ve seen an\nexample or two, you’re wise to the game: you know that it could go either way.\nBut we’ve just come across another pitfall: the classic \ndéformation\nprofessionnelle\n (professional oversight) of mathematicians: common sense would\ntell you that heads is the wiser choice, since the coin is obviously loaded.\nPreviously, we looked at \nregression to mean\n. An example: if you are\nexperiencing record cold where you live, it is likely that the temperature will return\nto normal values over the next few days. If the weather functioned like a casino,\nthere would be a 50% chance that the temperature would rise and a 50% chance\nthat it would drop. But the weather is not like a casino. Complex feedback\nmechanisms in the atmosphere ensure that extremes balance themselves out. In\nother cases, however, extremes intensify. For example, the rich tend to get richer.\nA stock that shoots up creates its own demand to a certain extent, simply because\nit stands out so much – a sort of reverse compensation effect.\nSo, take a closer look at the independent and interdependent events around\nyou. Purely independent events really only exist at the casino, in the lottery and in\ntheory. In real life, in the ﬁnancial markets and in business, with the weather and\nyour health, events are often interrelated. What has already happened has an\ninﬂuence on what will happen. As comforting an idea as it is, there is simply no\nbalancing force out there for independent events. ‘What goes around, comes\naround’ simply does not exist.\nSee also \nProblem with Averages\n (ch. 55);\n Base-Rate Neglect\n (ch. 28); \nDéformation\nProfessionnelle\n (ch. 92); \nRegression to the Mean\n (ch. 19); \nSimple Logic\n (ch. 63)\n30\nWHY THE WHEEL OF FORTUNE MAKES OUR HEADS SPIN\nThe Anchor\nWhen was Abraham Lincoln born? If you don’t know the year off the top of your\nhead, and your smartphone battery has just died, how do you answer this?\nPerhaps you know that he was president during the Civil War in the 1860s and\nthat he was the ﬁrst U.S. president to be assassinated. Looking at the Lincoln\nMemorial in Washington, you don’t see a young, energetic man but something\nmore akin to a worn-out 60-year-old veteran. The memorial must depict him at the\nheight of his political power, say at the age of 60. Let’s assume that he was\nassassinated in the mid-1860s, making 1805 our estimate for the year he was\nborn. (The correct answer is 1809.) So how did we work it out? We found an\nanchor\n to help us – the 1860s – and worked from there to an educated guess.\nWhenever we have to guess something – the length of the Mississippi River,\npopulation density in Russia, the number of nuclear power plants in France – we\nuse \nanchors\n. We start with something we are sure of and venture into unfamiliar\nterritory from there. How else could we do it? Just pick a number off the top of our\nheads? That would be irrational.\nUnfortunately, we also use \nanchors\n when we don’t need to. For example, one\nday in a lecture, a professor placed a bottle of wine on the table. He asked his\nstudents to write down the last two digits of their social security numbers and then\ndecide if they would be willing to spend that amount on the wine. In the auction\nthat followed, students with higher numbers bid nearly twice as much as students\nwith lower numbers. The social security digits worked as an \nanchor\n – albeit in a\nhidden and misleading way.\nThe psychologist Amos Tversky conducted an experiment involving a wheel of\nfortune. He had participants spin it, and afterward, they were asked how many\nmember states the United Nations has. Their guesses conﬁrmed the \nanchor\neffect: the highest estimates came from people who had spun high numbers on\nthe wheel.\nResearchers Russo and Shoemaker asked students in what year Attila the Hun\nsuffered his crushing defeat in Europe. Just like the example with social security\nnumbers, the participants were anchored – this time with the last few digits of their\ntelephone number. The result? People with higher numbers chose later years\nand vice versa. (If you were wondering, Attila’s demise came about in 453.)\nAnother experiment: students and professional real-estate agents were given a\ntour of a house and asked to estimate its value. Beforehand, they were informed\nabout a (randomly generated) listed sales price. As might be expected, the\nanchor\n inﬂuenced the students: the higher this price, the higher they valued the\nproperty. And the professionals? Did they value the house objectively? No, they\nwere similarly inﬂuenced by the random \nanchor\n amount. The more uncertain the\nvalue of something – such as real estate, company stock or art – the more\nsusceptible even experts are to \nanchors\n.\nAnchors\n abound, and we all clutch at them. The ‘recommended retail price’\nprinted on many products is nothing more than an \nanchor\n. Sales professionals\nknow they must establish a price at an early stage – long before they have an\noffer. Also, it has been proven that if teachers know students’ past grades, it\ninﬂuences how they will mark new work. The most recent grades act as a starting\npoint.\nIn my early years, I had a quick stint at a consulting ﬁrm. My boss was a pro\nwhen it came to using \nanchors\n. In his ﬁrst conversation with any client, he made\nsure to ﬁx an opening price, which, by the way, almost criminally exceeded our\ninternal costs: ‘I’ll tell you this now so you’re not surprised when you receive the\nquote, Mr. So-and-So: we’ve just completed a similar project for one of your\ncompetitors and it was in the range of ﬁve million dollars.’ The \nanchor\n was\ndropped: the price negotiations started at exactly five million.\nSee also \nFraming\n (ch. 42)\n31\nHOW TO RELIEVE PEOPLE OF THEIR MILLIONS\nInduction\nA farmer feeds a goose. At ﬁrst, the shy animal is hesitant, wondering ‘What’s\ngoing on here? Why is he feeding me?’ This continues for a few more weeks\nuntil, eventually, the goose’s scepticism gives way. After a few months, the goose\nis sure that ‘The farmer has my best interests at heart.’ Each additional day’s\nfeeding conﬁrms this. Fully convinced of the man’s benevolence, the goose is\namazed when he takes it out of its enclosure on Christmas Day – and slaughters\nit. The Christmas goose fell victim to \ninductive thinking\n, the inclination to draw\nuniversal certainties from individual observations. Philosopher David Hume used\nthis allegory back in the eighteenth century to warn of its pitfalls. However, it’s not\njust geese that are susceptible to it.\nAn investor buys shares in stock X. The share price rockets, and at ﬁrst he is\nwary. ‘Probably a bubble,’ he suspects. As the stock continues to rise, even after\nmonths, his apprehension turns into excitement: ‘This stock may never come\ndown’ – especially since every day this is the case. After half a year, he invests\nhis life savings in it, turning a blind eye to the huge cluster risk this poses. Later,\nthe man will pay for his foolish investment. He has fallen hook, line and sinker for\ninduction\n.\nInductive thinking\n doesn’t have to be a road to ruin, though. In fact, you can\nmake a fortune with it by sending a few emails. Here’s how: put together two\nstock market forecasts – one predicting that prices will rise next month and one\nwarning of a drop. Send the ﬁrst email to 50,000 people, and the second email to\na different set of 50,000. Suppose that after one month, the indices have fallen.\nNow you can send another email, but this time only to the 50,000 people who\nreceived a correct prediction. These 50,000 you divide into two groups: the ﬁrst\nhalf learns that prices will increase next month, the second half discovers they\nwill fall. Continue doing this. After 10 months, around 100 people will remain, all\nof whom you have advised impeccably. From their perspective, you are a genius.\nYou have proven that you are truly in possession of prophetic powers. Some of\nthese people will trust you with their money. Take it and start a new life in Brazil.\nHowever, it’s not just naïve strangers who get deceived in this way; we\nconstantly trick ourselves, too. For example, people who are rarely ill consider\nthemselves immortal. CEOs who announce increased proﬁts in consecutive\nquarters deem themselves infallible – their employees and shareholders do, too. I\nonce had a friend who was a base jumper.

He replied quite matter-of-factly: ‘I’ve over 1,000 jumps\nunder my belt, and nothing has ever happened to me.’ Two months later, he was\ndead. It happened when he jumped from a particularly dangerous cliff in South\nAfrica. This single event was enough to eradicate a theory conﬁrmed a thousand\ntimes over.\nInductive thinking\n can have devastating results. Yet we cannot do without it.\nWe trust that, when we board a plane, aerodynamic laws will still be valid. We\nimagine that we will not be randomly beaten up on the street. We expect that our\nhearts will still be beating tomorrow. These are conﬁdences without which we\ncould not live, but we must remember that certainties are always provisional. As\nBenjamin Franklin said, ‘Nothing is certain but death and taxes.’\nInduction\n seduces us and leads us to conclusions such as: ‘Mankind has\nalways survived, so we will be able to tackle any future challenges, too.’ Sounds\ngood in theory, but what we fail to realise is that such a statement can only come\nfrom a species that has lasted until now. To assume that our existence to date is\nan indication of our future survival is a serious ﬂaw in reasoning. Probably the\nmost serious of all.\nSee also \nFalse Causality\n (ch.37);\n Survivorship Bias\n (ch. 1)\n32\nWHY EVIL STRIKES HARDER THAN GOOD\nLoss Aversion\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, how good do you feel today? Now consider what would\nbring you up to a perfect 10. That vacation in the Caribbean you’ve always\ndreamed of? A step up the career ladder maybe? Next question: what would\nmake you drop down by the same number of points? Paralysis, Alzheimer’s,\ncancer, depression, war, hunger, torture, ﬁnancial ruin, damage to your\nreputation, losing your best friend, your children getting kidnapped, blindness,\ndeath? The long list of possibilities makes us realise just how many obstacles to\nhappiness exist; in short, there are more bad things than good – and they are far\nmore consequential.\nIn our evolutionary past, this was even more the case. One stupid mistake and\nyou were dead. Everything could lead to your rapid departure from the game of\nlife – carelessness on the hunt, an inﬂamed tendon, exclusion from the group and\nso on. People who were reckless or gung-ho died before they could pass their\ngenes on to the next generation. Those who remained, the cautious, survived. We\nare their descendants.\nSo, no wonder we fear loss more than we value gain. Losing $100 costs you a\ngreater amount of happiness than the delight you would feel if I gave you $100. In\nfact, it has been proven that, emotionally, a loss ‘weighs’ about twice that of a\nsimilar gain. Social scientists call this \nloss aversion\n.\nFor this reason, if you want to convince someone about something, don’t focus\non the advantages; instead highlight how it helps them dodge the disadvantages.\nHere is an example from a campaign promoting breast self-examination (BSE):\ntwo different leaﬂets were handed out to women. Pamphlet A urged: ‘Research\nshows that women who \ndo\n BSE have an \nincreased\n chance of ﬁnding a tumour in\nthe early, more treatable state of the disease.’ Pamphlet B said: ‘Research shows\nthat women who do \nnot do\n BSE have a \ndecreased\n chance of ﬁnding a tumour in\nthe early, more treatable state of the disease.’ The study revealed that pamphlet B\n(written in a ‘loss-frame’) generated signiﬁcantly more awareness and BSE\nbehaviour than pamphlet A (written in a ‘gain-frame’).\nThe fear of losing something motivates people more than the prospect of\ngaining something of equal value. Suppose your business is home insulation.\nThe most effective way of encouraging customers to purchase your product is to\ntell them how much money they are losing without insulation – as opposed to\nhow much money they would save with it, even though the amount is exactly the\nsame.\nThis type of aversion is also found on the stock market, where investors tend to\nsimply ignore losses on paper. After all, an unrealised loss isn’t as painful as a\nrealised one. So they sit on the stock, even if the chance of recovery is small and\nthe probability of further decline is large. I once met a man, a multimillionaire, who\nwas terribly upset because he had lost a $100 bill. What a waste of emotion! I\npointed out that the value of his portfolio fluctuated by at least $100 every second.\nManagement gurus push employees in large companies to be bolder and more\nentrepreneurial. The reality is: employees tend to be risk-averse. From their\nperspective, this aversion makes perfect sense: why risk something that brings\nthem, at best, a nice bonus, and at worst, a pink slip? The downside is larger than\nthe upside. In almost all companies and situations, safeguarding your career\ntrumps any potential reward. So, if you’ve been scratching your head about the\nlack of risk-taking among your employees, you now know why. (However, if\nemployees do take big risks, it is often when they can hide behind group\ndecisions. Learn more in chapter 33 on \nsocial loafing.\n)\nWe can’t ﬁght it: evil is more powerful and more plentiful than good. We are\nmore sensitive to negative than to positive things. On the street, scary faces stand\nout more than smiling ones. We remember bad behaviour longer than good –\nexcept, of course, when it comes to ourselves.\nSee also \nHouse-Money Effect\n (ch. 84);\n Endowment Effect\n (ch. 23);\n Social Loafing\n (ch.\n33); \nDefault Effect\n (ch. 81); \nSunk Cost Fallacy\n (ch. 5); \nFraming\n (ch. 42); \nAffect Heuristic\n(ch. 66)\n33\nWHY TEAMS ARE LAZY\nSocial Loafing\nIn 1913 Maximilian Ringelmann, a French engineer, studied the performance of\nhorses. He concluded that the power of two animals pulling a coach did not equal\ntwice the power of a single horse. Surprised by this result, he extended his\nresearch to humans. He had several men pull a rope and measured the force\napplied by each individual. On average, if two people were pulling together, each\ninvested just 93% of their individual strength, when three pulled together, it was\n85%, and with eight people, just 49%.\nScience calls this the \nsocial loaﬁng\n effect. It occurs when individual\nperformance is not directly visible; it blends in to the group effort. It occurs among\nrowers, but not in relay races, because here, individual contributions are evident.\nSocial loaﬁng\n is rational behaviour: why invest all of your energy when half will\ndo – especially when this little shortcut goes unnoticed? Quite simply, \nsocial\nloafing\n is a form of cheating of which we are all guilty even if it takes place\nunconsciously, just as it did with Ringelmann’s horses.\nWhen people work together, individual performances decrease. This isn’t\nsurprising. What is noteworthy, however, is that our input doesn’t grind to a\ncomplete halt. So what stops us from putting our feet up completely and letting the\nothers do all the hard work? The consequences. Zero-performance would be\nnoticed, and it brings with it weighty punishments, such as exclusion from the\ngroup or viliﬁcation. Evolution has led us to develop many ﬁne-tuned senses,\nincluding how much idleness we can get away with and how to recognise it in\nothers.\nSocial loaﬁng\n does not occur solely in physical performance. We slack off\nmentally, too. For example, in meetings, the larger the team the weaker our\nindividual participation. However, once a certain number of participants is\ninvolved, our performance plateaus. Whether the group consists of 20 or 100\npeople is not important – maximum inertia has been achieved.\nOne question remains: who came up with the much-vaunted idea that teams\nachieve more than individual workers? Maybe the Japanese. Thirty years ago,\nthey ﬂooded global markets with their products. Business economists looked\nmore closely at the industrial miracle and saw that Japanese factories were\norganised into teams. This model was copied – with mixed success. What\nworked very well in Japan could not be replicated with the Americans and\nEuropeans – perhaps because\n social loaﬁng\n rarely happens there. In the West,\nteams function better if and only if they are small and consist of diverse,\nspecialised people. This makes sense, because within such groups, individual\nperformances can be traced back to each specialist.\nSocial loafing\n has interesting implications. In groups, we tend to hold back not\nonly in terms of participation, but also in terms of accountability. Nobody wants to\ntake the rap for the misdeeds or poor"

How thick\nwill it be after 50 folds? Write down your guess before you continue reading.\nSecond task. Choose between these options: A) Over the next 30 days, I will\ngive you $1,000 a day. B) Over the next 30 days, I will give you a cent on the ﬁrst\nday, two cents on the second day, four cents on the third day, eight cents on the\nfourth day, and so on. Don’t think too long about it: A or B?\nAre you ready? Well, if we assume that a sheet of copy paper is approximately\n0.004 inches thick, then its thickness after 50 folds is a little over 60 million miles.\nThis equals the distance between the earth and the sun, as you can check easily\nwith a calculator. With the second question, it is worthwhile choosing option B,\neven though A sounds more tempting. Selecting A earns you $30,000 in 30 days;\nchoosing B gives you more than $5 million.\nLinear growth we understand intuitively. However, we have no sense of\nexponential (or percentage) growth. Why is this? Because we didn’t need it\nbefore. Our ancestors’ experiences were mostly of the linear variety. Whoever\nspent twice the time collecting berries earned double the amount. Whoever\nhunted two mammoths instead of one could eat for twice as long. In the Stone\nAge, people rarely came across \nexponential growth\n. Today, things are different.\n‘Each year, the number of traffic accidents rises by 7%,’ warns a politician. Let’s\nbe honest: we don’t intuitively understand what this means. So, let’s use a trick\nand calculate the ‘doubling time’. Start with the magic number of 70 and divide it\nby the growth rate in per cent. In this instance: 70 divided by 7 = 10 years. So\nwhat the politician is saying is: ‘The number of trafﬁc accidents doubles every 10\nyears.’ Pretty alarming. (You may ask: ‘Why the number 70?’ This has to do with\na mathematical concept called logarithm. You can look it up in the notes section.)\nAnother example: ‘Inﬂation is at 5%.’ Whoever hears this thinks: ‘That’s not so\nbad, what’s 5% anyway?’ Let’s quickly calculate the doubling time: 70 divided by\n5 = 14 years. In 14 years, a dollar will be worth only half what it is today – a\ncatastrophe for anyone who has a savings account.\nSuppose you are a journalist and learn that the number of registered dogs in\nyour city is rising by 10% a year. Which headline do you put on your article?\nCertainly not: ‘Dog registrations increasing by 10%.’ No one will care. Instead,\nannounce: ‘Deluge of dogs: twice as many mutts in 7 years’ time!’\nNothing that grows exponentially grows for ever. Most politicians, economists\nand journalists forget that. Such growth will eventually reach a limit. Guaranteed.\nFor example, the intestinal bacterium, Escherichia coli, divides every twenty\nminutes. In just a few days it could cover the whole planet, but since it consumes\nmore oxygen and sugar than is available, its growth has a cut-off point.\nThe ancient Persians were well aware that people struggled with percentage\ngrowth. Here is a local tale: there was once a wise courtier, who presented the\nking with a chessboard. Moved by the gift, the king said to him: ‘Tell me how I can\nthank you.’ The courtier replied: ‘Your Highness, I want nothing more than for you\nto cover the chessboard with rice, putting one grain of rice on the ﬁrst square, and\nthen on every subsequent square, twice the previous number of grains.’ The king\nwas astonished: ‘It is an honour to you, dear courtier, that you present such a\nmodest request.’\nBut how much rice is that? The king guessed about a sack. Only when his\nservants began the task – placing a grain on the ﬁrst square, two grains of rice on\nthe second square, four grains of rice on the third, and so on – did he realise that\nhe would need more rice than was growing on earth.\nWhen it comes to growth rates, do not trust your intuition. You don’t have any.\nAccept it. What really helps is a calculator, or, with low growth rates, the magic\nnumber of 70.\nSee also \nSimple Logic\n (ch. 63);\n Neglect of Probability\n (ch. 26); \nThe Law of Small\nNumbers\n (ch. 61)\n35\nCURB YOUR ENTHUSIASM\nWinner’s Curse\nTexas in the 1950s. A piece of land is being auctioned. Ten oil companies are\nvying for it. Each has made an estimate of how much the site is worth. The lowest\nassessment is $10 million, and the highest is $100 million. The higher the price\nclimbs during the auction, the more ﬁrms exit the bidding. Finally, one company\nsubmits the highest bid and wins. Champagne corks pop.\nThe \nwinner’s curse\n suggests that the winner of an auction often turns out to be\nthe loser. Industry analysts have noted that companies that regularly emerged as\nwinning bidders from these oilﬁeld auctions systematically paid too much, and\nyears later went under. This is understandable. If the estimates vary between $10\nmillion and $100 million, the actual value most likely lies somewhere in the\nmiddle. The highest bid at an auction is often much too high – unless these\nbidders have critical information others are not privy to. This was not the case in\nTexas. The oil managers actually celebrated a Pyrrhic victory.\nToday, this phenomenon affects us all. From eBay to Groupon to Google\nAdWords, prices are consistently set by auction. Bidding wars for cellphone\nfrequencies drive telecom companies to the brink of bankruptcy. Airports rent out\ntheir commercial spaces to the highest bidder. And if Walmart plans to introduce a\nnew detergent and asks for tenders from ﬁve suppliers, that’s nothing more than\nan auction – with the risk of the \nwinner’s curse\n.\nThe auctioning of everyday life has now reached tradesmen, too, thanks to the\nInternet. When my walls needed a new lick of paint, instead of tracking down the\nhandiest painter, I advertised the job online. Thirty painters, some from more than\n300 miles away, competed for the job. The best offer was so low that, out of\ncompassion, I could not accept it – to spare the poor painter the \nwinner’s curse\n.\nInitial Public Offerings (IPOs) are also examples of auctions. And, when\ncompanies buy other companies – the infamous mergers and acquisitions – the\nwinner’s curse\n is present more often than not. Astoundingly, more than half of all\nacquisitions destroy value, according to a McKinsey study.\nSo why do we fall victim to the \nwinner’s curse\n? First, the real value of many\nthings is uncertain. Additionally, the more interested parties, the greater the\nlikelihood of an overly enthusiastic bid. Second, we want to outdo competitors. A\nfriend owns a micro-antenna factory and told me about the cut-throat bidding war\nthat Apple instigated during the development of the iPhone. Everyone wants to be\nthe ofﬁcial supplier to Apple even though whoever gets the contract is likely to\nlose money.\nSo how much would you pay for $100? Imagine that you and an opponent are\ninvited to take part in such an auction. The rules: whoever makes the highest offer\ngets the $100 bill, and – most importantly – when this happens, both bidders have\nto pay their ﬁnal offer. How high will you go? From your perspective, it makes\nsense to pay $20, $30 or $40. Your opponent does the same. Even $99 seems\nlike a reasonable offer for a $100 bill. Now, your competitor offers $100. If this\nremains the highest bid, he will come away breaking even (paying $100 for\n$100), whereas you will simply have to cough up $99. So you continue to bid. At\n$"

Write this\nnumber on a piece of paper and don’t go a cent over it.\nSee also \nEndowment Effect\n (ch. 23)\n36\nNEVER ASK A WRITER IF THE NOVEL IS AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL\nFundamental Attribution Error\nOpening the newspaper, you learn that another CEO has been forced to step\ndown because of bad results. In the sports section, you read that your team’s\nwinning season was thanks to player X or coach Y. In history books, you learn\nthat the success of the French army in the early 1800s is a testament to\nNapoleon’s superb leadership and strategy. ‘Every story has a face’, it seems.\nIndeed this is an ironclad rule in every newsroom. Always on the lookout for the\n‘people angle’, journalists (and their readers) take this principle one step further,\nand thus fall prey to the \nfundamental attribution error\n. This describes the tendency\nto overestimate individuals’ inﬂuence and underestimate external, situational\nfactors.\nIn 1967, researchers at Duke University set up the following experiment:\nparticipants read an argument either lauding or vilifying Fidel Castro. They were\ninformed that the author of the text had been allocated the viewpoint regardless of\nhis true political views; he was just making a coherent argument. Nevertheless,\nmost of the audience believed what he said reﬂected his true opinion. They\nfalsely attributed the content of the speech to his character, and ignored the\nexternal factors; in this case the professors who had crafted the text.\nThe \nfundamental attribution error\n is particularly useful for whittling negative\nevents into neat little packages. For example, the ‘blame’ for wars we lazily push\non to individuals: the Yugoslav assassin in Sarajevo has World War I on his\nconscience, and Hitler singlehandedly caused World War II. Many swallow these\nsimpliﬁcations, even though wars are unforeseeable events whose innumerable\ndynamics we may never fully understand. Which sounds a little like ﬁnancial\nmarkets and climate issues, don’t you agree?\nWe see this same pattern when companies announce good or bad results. All\neyes shift to the CEO’s ofﬁce, even if we know the truth: economic success\ndepends far more on the overall economic climate and the industry’s\nattractiveness than on brilliant leadership. It is interesting how frequently ﬁrms in\nailing industries replace their CEOs – and how seldom that happens in booming\nsectors. Are ailing industries less careful in their recruitment processes? Such\ndecisions are no more rational than what happens between football coaches and\ntheir clubs.\nI often go to musical concerts. In my home town of Lucerne, in the centre of\nSwitzerland, I am spoiled with one-off classical recitals. During the intermission,\nhowever, I notice that the conversations almost always revolve around the\nconductors and/or soloists. With the exception of world premieres, composition is\nrarely discussed. Why? The real miracle of music is, after all, the composition: the\ncreation of sounds, moods and rhythms where previously only a blank sheet lay.\nThe difference among scores is a thousand times more impressive than the\ndifference among performances of the same score. But we do not think like this.\nThe score is – in contrast to the conductors and soloists – faceless.\nIn my career as a ﬁction writer, I experience the \nfundamental attribution error\n in\nthis way: after a reading (which in itself is a debatable undertaking), the ﬁrst\nquestion always, really always, is: ‘What part of your novel is autobiographical?’ I\noften feel like thundering: ‘It’s not about me, damn it! It’s about the book, the text,\nthe language, the credibility of the story!’ But unfortunately my upbringing allows\nsuch outbursts only rarely.\nWe shouldn’t judge those guilty of the \nfundamental attribution error\n too harshly.\nOur preoccupation with other people stems from our evolutionary past: belonging\nto a group was necessary for survival. Reproduction, defence, and hunting large\nanimals – all these were impossible tasks for individuals to achieve alone.\nBanishment meant certain death, and those who actively opted for the solitary life\n– of whom there were surely a few – fared no better and also disappeared from\nthe gene pool. In short, our lives depended on and revolved around others, which\nexplains why we are so obsessed with our fellow humans today. The result of this\ninfatuation is that we spend about 90% of our time thinking about other people,\nand dedicate just 10% to assessing other factors and contexts.\nIn conclusion: as much as we are fascinated by the spectacle of life, the people\non stage are not perfect, self-governed individuals. Instead they tumble from\nsituation to situation. If you want to understand the current play – really\nunderstand it – then forget about the performers. Pay close attention to the dance\nof influences to which the actors are subjected.\nSee also \nStory Bias\n (ch. 13);\n Swimmer’s Body Illusion\n (ch. 2);\n Salience Effect\n (ch. 83);\nNews Illusion\n (ch. 99); \nHalo Effect\n (ch. 38);\n Fallacy of the Single Cause\n (ch. 97)\n37\nWHY YOU SHOULDN’T BELIEVE IN THE STORK\nFalse Causality\nFor the inhabitants of the Hebrides, a chain of islands north of Scotland, head lice\nwere a part of life. If the lice left their host, he became sick and feverish.\nTherefore, to dispel the fever, sick people had lice put in their hair intentionally.\nThere was a method to their madness: as soon as the lice had settled in again,\nthe patient improved.\nIn one city, a study revealed that in each blaze, the more ﬁreﬁghters called out\nto ﬁght it the greater the ﬁre damage. The mayor imposed an immediate hiring\nfreeze and cut the firefighting budget.\nBoth stories come from German physics professors Hans-Peter Beck-Bornholdt\nand Hans-Hermann Dubben. In their book (unfortunately there is no English\nversion), they illustrate the muddling of cause and effect. If the lice leave the\ninvalid, it is because he has a fever and they simply get hot feet. When the fever\nbreaks, they return. And the bigger the blaze, the more ﬁreﬁghters were called out\n– not, of course, vice versa.\nWe may smirk at these stories, but \nfalse causality\n leads us astray practically\nevery day. Consider the headline ‘Employee motivation leads to higher corporate\nproﬁts.’ Does it? Maybe people are simply more motivated because the company\nis doing well. Another headline touts that the more women on a corporate board,\nthe more proﬁtable the ﬁrm is. But is that really how it works? Or do highly\nproﬁtable ﬁrms simply tend to recruit more women to their boards? Business-book\nauthors and consultants often operate with similar false – or at least fuzzy –\ncausalities.\nIn the 90s, there was no one holier than the then head of the Federal Reserve,\nAlan Greenspan. His obscure remarks gave monetary policy the aura of a secret\nscience that kept the country on the secure path of prosperity. Politicians,\njournalists and business leaders idolised Greenspan. Today we know that these\ncommentators fell victim to \nfalse causality\n. America’s symbiosis with China, the\nglobe’s low-cost producer and eager buyer of U.S. debt, played a much more\nimportant role. In other words, Greenspan was simply lucky that the economy did\nso well during his tenure.\nA further example: scientists found that long periods in the hospital affected\npatients adversely. This was music to health insurers’ ears; they, of course, are\nkeen to make stays as brief as possible. But, clearly, patients who are discharged\nimmediately are healthier than those who must stay on for treatment. This hardly\nmakes long stays detrimental.\nOr, take this headline: ‘Fact: Women who use shampoo XYZ every day have\nstronger hair.’ Though the context can be substantiated scientiﬁcally, this\nstatement says very little – least of all that the shampoo makes your hair stronger.\nIt might simply be the other way round: women with strong hair tend to use\nshampoo XYZ – and perhaps that’s because it says ‘especially for thick hair’ on\nthe bottle.\nRecently I read that students get better grades at school if their homes contain\na lot of books. This study was surely a shot in the arm for booksellers, but it is\nanother ﬁne example of \nfalse causality\n. The simple truth is that educated parents\ntend to value their children’s education more than uneducated ones do. Plus,\neducated parents often have more books at home. In short, a dust-covered copy\nof \nWar and Peace\n alone isn’t going to inﬂuence anyone’s grades; what counts is\nparents’ education levels, as well as their genes.\nThe best example of \nfalse causality\n was the supposed relationship between\nthe birth rate and the numbers of stork pairs in Germany. Both were in decline,\nand if you plot them on a graph the two lines of development from 1965 to 1987\nappeared almost identical. Does this mean the stork actually does bring babies?\nObviously not, since this was a purely coincidental correlation.\nIn conclusion: correlation is not causality. Take a closer look at linked events:\nsometimes what is presented as the cause turns out to be the effect, and vice\nversa. And sometimes there is no link at all – just like with the storks and babies.\nSee also \nCoincidence\n (ch. 24); \nAssociation Bias\n (ch. 48); \nClustering Illusion\n (ch. 3);\nStory Bias\n (ch. 13); \nInduction\n (ch. 31); \nBeginner’s Luck\n (ch. 49)\n38\nEVERYONE IS BEAUTIFUL AT THE TOP\nHalo Effect\nCisco, the Silicon Valley ﬁrm, was once a darling of the new economy. Business\njournalists gushed about its success in every discipline: its wonderful customer\nservice, perfect strategy, skilful acquisitions, unique corporate culture and\ncharismatic CEO. In March 2000, it was the most valuable company in the world.\nWhen Cisco’s stock plummeted 80% the following year, the journalists\nchanged their tune. Suddenly the company’s competitive advantages were\nreframed as destructive shortcomings: poor customer service, a woolly strategy,\nclumsy acquisitions, a lame corporate culture and an insipid CEO. All this – and\nyet neither the strategy nor the CEO had changed. What had changed, in the\nwake of the dot-com crash, was demand for Cisco’s product – and that was\nthrough no fault of the firm.\nThe \nhalo effect\n occurs when a single aspect dazzles us and affects how we\nsee the full picture. In the case of Cisco, its halo shone particularly bright.\nJournalists were astounded by its stock prices and assumed the entire business\nwas just as brilliant – without making closer investigation.\nThe \nhalo effect\n always works the same way: we take a simple-to-obtain or\nremarkable fact or detail, such as a company’s ﬁnancial situation, and extrapolate\nconclusions from there that are harder to nail down, such as the merit of its\nmanagement or the feasibility of its strategy. We often ascribe success and\nsuperiority where little is due, such as when we favour products from a\nmanufacturer simply because of its good reputation. Another example of the \nhalo\neffect\n: we believe that CEOs who are successful in one industry will thrive in any\nsector – and furthermore that they are heroes in their private lives, too.\nThe psychologist Edward Lee Thorndike discovered the \nhalo effect\n nearly 100\nyears ago. His conclusion was that a single quality (e.g., beauty, social status,\nage) produces a positive or negative impression that outshines everything else,\nand the overall effect is disproportionate. Beauty is the best-studied example.\nDozens of studies have shown that we automatically regard good-looking people\nas more pleasant, honest and intelligent. Attractive people also have it easier in\ntheir professional lives – and that has nothing to do with the myth of women\n‘sleeping their way to the top’. The effect can even be detected in schools, where\nteachers unconsciously give good-looking students better grades.\nAdvertising has found an ally in the \nhalo effect\n: just look at the number of\ncelebrities smiling at us from TV ads, billboards and magazines. What makes a\nprofessional tennis player like Roger Federer a coffee machine expert is still\nopen for debate, but this hasn’t detracted from the success of the campaign. We\nare so used to seeing celebrities promoting arbitrary products that we never stop\nto consider why their support should be of any importance to us. But this is\nexactly the sneaky part of the \nhalo effect\n: it works on a subconscious level. All\nthat needs to register is the attractive face, dream lifestyle – and that product.\nSticking with negative effects, the \nhalo effect \ncan lead to great injustice and\neven stereotyping when nationality, gender, or race becomes the all-\nencompassing feature. One need be neither racist nor sexist to fall victim to this.\nThe \nhalo effect\n clouds our view, just as it does the view of journalists, educators,\nand consumers.\nOccasionally, this effect has pleasant consequences – at least in the short term.\nHave you ever been head over heels in love? If so, you know how ﬂawless a\nperson can appear. Your Mr or Ms Perfect seems to be the whole package:\nattractive, intelligent, likeable and warm. Even when your friends might point out\nobvious failings, you see nothing but endearing quirks.\nThe \nhalo effect\n obstructs our view of true characteristics. To counteract this, go\nbeyond face value. Factor out the most striking features. World-class orchestras\nachieve this by making candidates play behind a screen, so that sex, race, age\nand appearance play no part in their decision. To business journalists I warmly\nrecommend judging a company by something other than its easily obtainable\nquarterly ﬁgures (the stock market already delivers that). Dig deeper. Invest the\ntime to do serious research. What emerges is not always pretty, but almost\nalways educational.\nSee also \nFundamental Attribution Error\n (ch. 36); \nSalience Effect\n (ch. 83); \nSwimmer’s\nBody Illusion\n (ch. 2); \nContrast Effect\n (ch. 10); \nExpectations\n (ch. 62)\n39\nCONGRATULATIONS! YOU’VE WON RUSSIAN ROULETTE\nAlternative Paths\nYou arrange to meet with a Russian oligarch in a forest just outside your city. He\narrives shortly after you, carrying a suitcase and a gun. Placing the suitcase on\nthe hood of his car, he opens it so you can see it is ﬁlled to the brim with stacks of\nmoney – $10 million in total. ‘Want to play Russian roulette?’ he asks. ‘Pull the\ntrigger once, and all this is yours.’ The revolver contains a single bullet; the other\nﬁve chambers are empty. You consider your options. $10 million would change\nyour life. You would never have to work again. You could ﬁnally move from\ncollecting stamps to collecting sports cars!\nYou accept the challenge. You put the revolver to your temple and squeeze the\ntrigger. You hear a faint click and feel adrenaline ﬂood your body. Nothing\nhappens. The chamber was empty! You have survived. You take the money,\nmove to the most beautiful city you know and upset the locals by building a\nluxurious villa there.\nOne of these neighbours, whose home now stands in the shadow of yours, is a\nprominent lawyer. He works twelve hours a day, 300 days a year. His rates are\nimpressive, but not unusual: $500 per hour. Each year he can put aside half a\nmillion net after taxes and living expenses. From time to time, you wave to him\nfrom your driveway, laughing on the inside: he will have to work for twenty years\nto catch up with you.\nSuppose that, after twenty years, your hard-working neighbour has saved up\n$10 million. A journalist comes along one day and puts together a piece on the\nmore afﬂuent residents in the area – complete with photos of the magniﬁcent\nbuildings and the beautiful second wives that you and your neighbour have\naccrued. He comments on the interior design and the exquisite landscaping.\nHowever, the crucial difference between the two of you remains hidden from\nview: the risk that lurks behind each of the $10 million. For this he would need to\nrecognise the \nalternative paths.\nBut not only journalists are underachievers at this skill. We all are.\nA\nlternative paths\n are all the outcomes that could have happened, but did not.\nWith the game of Russian roulette, four \nalternative paths\n would have led to the\nsame result (winning the $10 million) and the ﬁfth alternative to your death. A\nhuge difference. In the case of the lawyer, the possible paths lie much more close\ntogether. In a village, he would have earned perhaps just $200 per hour. In the\nheart of New York working for one of the major investment banks, maybe it would\nhave been $600 per hour. But, unlike you, he risked no \nalternative path\n that\nwould have cost him his fortune – or his life.\nAlternative paths\n are invisible, so we contemplate them very rarely. Those who\nspeculate on junk bonds, options and credit default swaps, thus making millions,\nshould never forget that they ﬂirt with many \nalternative paths\n that lead straight to\nruin. To a rational mind, ten million dollars that comes about through a huge risk\nis worth less than the same sum earned by years of drudgery. (An accountant\nmight disagree, though.)\nRecently, I was at a dinner with an American friend who suggested tossing a\ncoin to decide who should pay the bill. He lost. The situation was uncomfortable\nfor me, since he was my guest in Switzerland. ‘Next time I’ll pay, whether here or\nin New York,’ I promised. He thought for a moment and said, ‘Considering the\nalternative paths\n, you’ve actually already paid for half of this dinner.’\nIn conclusion: risk is not directly visible. Therefore, always consider what the\nalternative paths\n are. Success that comes about through risky dealings is, to a\nrational mind, of less worth than success achieved the ‘boring’ way (for example,\nwith laborious work as a lawyer, a dentist, a ski instructor, a pilot, a hairdresser or\na consultant). Yes, looking at \nalternative paths\n from the outside is a difﬁcult task.\nLooking at them from the inside is an almost impossible task. Your brain will do\neverything to convince you that your success is warranted – no matter how risky\nyour dealings are – and will obscure any thought of paths other than the one you\nare on.\nSee also \nBlack Swan\n (ch. 75);\n Ambiguity Aversion\n (ch. 80);\n Fear of Regret\n (ch. 82); \nSelf-\nSelection Bias\n (ch. 47)\n40\nFALSE PROPHETS\nForecast Illusion\n‘Facebook to be number one entertainment platform in three years.’\n‘Regime shift in North Korea in two years.’\n‘Sour grapes for France as Argentinian wines expected to dominate.’\n‘Euro collapse likely.’\n‘Low-cost space flights by 2025.’\n‘No more crude oil in 15 years.’\n \nEvery day, experts bombard us with predictions, but how reliable are they? Until a\nfew years ago, no one bothered to check. Then along came Philip Tetlock. Over a\nperiod of ten years, he evaluated 28,361 predictions from 284 self-appointed\nprofessionals. The result: in terms of accuracy, the experts fared only marginally\nbetter than a random forecast generator. Ironically, the media darlings were\namong the poorest performers; and of those the worst were the prophets of doom\nand disintegration. Examples of their far-fetched forecasts included the collapse\nof Canada, Nigeria, China, India, Indonesia, South Africa, Belgium and the E.U.\nNone of these countries has imploded.\n‘There\nare two kinds of forecasters: those who don’t know, and those who don’t\nknow they don’t know,’ wrote Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith. With\nthis he made himself a ﬁgure of hatred in his own guild. Fund manager Peter\nLynch summed it up even more cuttingly: ‘There\nare 60,000 economists in the\nU.S., many of them employed full-time trying to forecast recessions and interest\nrates, and if they could do it successfully twice in a row, they’d all be millionaires\nby now [?. . .?] As far as I know, most of them are still gainfully employed, which\nought to tell us something.’ That was ten years ago. Today, the U.S. could employ\nthree times as many economists – with little or no effect on the quality of their\nforecasts.\nThe problem is that experts enjoy free rein with few negative consequences. If\nthey strike it lucky, they enjoy publicity, consultancy offers and publication deals.\nIf they are completely off the mark, they face no penalties – either in terms of\nﬁnancial compensation or in loss of reputation. This win-win scenario virtually\nincentivises them to churn out as many prophecies as they can muster. Indeed,\nthe more forecasts they generate, the more will be coincidentally correct. Ideally,\nthey should have to pay into some sort of ‘forecast fund’ – say $1,000 per\nprediction. If the forecast is correct, the expert gets his money back with interest. If\nhe is wrong, the money goes to charity.\nSo what is predictable and what is not? Some things are fairly simple. For\nexample, I have a rough idea of how many pounds I will weigh in a year’s time.\nHowever, the more complex a system, and the longer the time frame, the more\nblurred the view of the future will be. Global warming, oil prices or exchange rates\nare almost impossible to foresee. Inventions are not at all predictable because if\nwe knew what technology we would invent in the future we would already have\ninvented it.\nSo, be critical when you encounter predictions. Whenever I hear one, I make\nsure to smile, no matter how bleak it is. Then I ask myself two questions. First,\nwhat incentive does the expert have? If he is an employee, could he lose his job if\nhe is always wrong? Or is he a self-appointed guru who earns a living through\nbooks and lectures? The latter type of forecaster relies on the media’s attention\nso, predictably, his prophecies tend to be sensational. Second, how good is his\nsuccess rate? How many predictions has he made over the past ﬁve years? Out\nof these, how many have been right and how many have not? This information is\nvital yet often goes unreported. I implore the media: please don’t publish any\nmore forecasts without giving the pundit’s track record.\nFinally, since it is so ﬁtting, a quote from former British prime minister Tony\nBlair: ‘I don’t make predictions. I never have, and I never will.’\nSee also \nExpectations\n (ch. 62);\n Planning Fallacy\n (ch. 91); \nAuthority Bias\n (ch. 9);\nHindsight Bias\n (ch. 14); \nOverconfidence Effect\n (ch. 15); \nIllusion of Control\n (ch. 17);\nHedonic Treadmill\n (ch. 46); \nBlack Swan\n (ch. 75)\n41\nTHE DECEPTION OF SPECIFIC CASES\nConjunction Fallacy\n \nChris is 35. He studied social philosophy and has had an interest in developing\ncountries since he was a teenager. After graduation, he worked for two years with\nthe Red Cross in West Africa and then for three years in its Geneva headquarters,\nwhere he rose to head of the African aid department. He then completed an MBA,\nwriting his thesis on corporate social responsibility. What is more likely? A) Chris\nworks for a major bank or B) Chris works for a major bank, where he runs its Third\nWorld foundation. A or B?\nMost people will opt for B. Unfortunately, it’s the wrong answer. Option B does\nnot only say that Chris works for a major bank, but also that an additional\ncondition has been met. Employees who work speciﬁcally within a bank’s Third\nWorld foundation comprise a tiny subset of bankers. Therefore, option A is much\nmore likely. The \nconjunction fallacy\n is at play when such a subset seems larger\nthan the entire set – which by deﬁnition cannot be the case. Nobel laureate\nDaniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky have studied this extensively.\nWe are easy prey for the \nconjunction fallacy\n because we have an innate\nattraction to ‘harmonious’ or ‘plausible’ stories. The more convincingly,\nimpressively or vividly Chris the aid worker is portrayed, the greater the risk of\nfalse reasoning. If I had put it a different way, you would have recognised the\nextra details as overly speciﬁc: for example ‘Chris is 35. What is more likely? A)\nChris works for a bank or B) Chris works for a bank in New York, where his ofﬁce\nis on the twenty-fourth floor, overlooking Central Park.’\nHere’s another example: What is more likely? A) ‘Seattle airport is closed.\nFlights are cancelled.’ B) ‘Seattle airport is closed due to bad weather. Flights are\ncancelled.’ A or B? This time, you have it: A is more likely since B implies that an\nadditional condition has been met, namely bad weather. It could be that a bomb\nthreat, accident or strike closed the airport; however, when faced with a\n‘plausible’ story, we don’t stop to consider such things. Now that you are aware of\nthis, try it out with friends. You will see that most pick B.\nEven experts are not immune to the \nconjunction fallacy\n. In 1982, at an\ninternational conference for future research, experts – all of them academics –\nwere divided into two groups. To group A, Daniel Kahneman presented the\nfollowing forecast for 1983: ‘Oil consumption will decrease by 30%.’ Group B\nheard that: ‘A dramatic rise in oil prices will lead to a 30% reduction in oil\nconsumption.’ Both groups had to indicate how likely they considered the\nscenarios. The result was clear: group B felt much more strongly about its\nforecast than group A did.\nKahneman believes that two types of thinking exist. The ﬁrst kind is intuitive,\nautomatic and direct. The second is conscious, rational, slow, laborious and\nlogical. Unfortunately, intuitive thinking draws conclusions long before the\nconscious mind does. For example, I experienced this after the 9/11 attacks on\nthe World Trade Center. I wanted to take out travel insurance and came across a\nﬁrm that offered special ‘terrorism cover’. Although other policies protected\nagainst all possible incidents (including terrorism), I automatically fell for the offer.\nThe high point of the whole farce was that I was willing to pay even more for this\nenticing yet redundant add-on.\nIn conclusion: forget about left brains and right brains. The difference between\nintuitive and conscious thinking is much more signiﬁcant. With important\ndecisions, remember that, at the intuitive level, we have a soft spot for plausible\nstories. Therefore, be on the lookout for convenient details and happy endings.\nRemember: if an additional condition has to be met, no matter how plausible it\nsounds, it will become less, not more, likely.\nSee also \nBase-Rate Neglect\n (ch. 28);\n Story Bias\n (ch. 13)\n42\nIT’S NOT WHAT YOU SAY, BUT HOW YOU SAY IT\nFraming\nConsider these two statements:\n‘Hey, the trashcan is full!’\n‘It would be really great if you could empty the trash, honey.’\n \nC’est le ton qui fait la musique\n: it’s not what you say, but how you say it. If a\nmessage is communicated in different ways, it will also be received in different\nways. In psychologists’ jargon, this technique is called \nframing\n.\nWe react differently to identical situations, depending on how they are\npresented. Kahneman and Tversky conducted a survey in the 1980s in which\nthey put forward two options for an epidemic-control strategy. The lives of 600\npeople were at stake, they told participants. ‘Option A saves 200 lives.’ ‘Option B\noffers a 33% chance that all 600 people will survive, and a 66% chance that no\none will survive.’ Although options A and B were comparable (with 200 survivors\nexpected), the majority of respondents chose A – remembering the adage: a bird\nin the hand is worth two in the bush. It became really interesting when the same\noptions were \nreframed\n. ‘Option A \nkills\n 400 people’, ‘Option B offers a 33% chance\nthat no one will die, and a 66% chance that all 600 will die.’ This time, only a\nfraction of respondents chose A and the majority picked B. The researchers\nobserved a complete U-turn from almost all involved. Depending on the phrasing\n– survive or die – the respondents made completely different decisions.\nAnother example: researchers presented a group of people with two kinds of\nmeat, ‘99% fat free’ and ‘1% fat’, and asked them to choose which was healthier.\nCan you guess which they picked? Bingo: respondents ranked the ﬁrst type of\nmeat as healthier, even though both were identical. Next came the choice\nbetween ‘98% fat free’ and ‘1% fat’. Again, most respondents chose the ﬁrst\noption – despite its higher fat content.\nGlossing\n is a popular type of \nframing\n. Under its rules, a tumbling share price\nbecomes ‘correction’. An overpaid acquisition price is branded ‘goodwill’. In\nevery management course, a problem magically transforms into an ‘opportunity’\nor a ‘challenge’. A person who is ﬁred is ‘reassessing his career’. A fallen soldier\n– regardless of how much bad luck or stupidity led to his death – turns into a ‘war\nhero’. Genocide translates to ‘ethnic cleansing’. A successful emergency landing,\nfor example on the Hudson River, is celebrated as a ‘triumph of aviation’.\n(Shouldn’t a textbook landing on a runway count as an even bigger triumph of\naviation?)\nHave you ever looked more closely at the prospectus for ﬁnancial products –\nfor example, ETFs (exchange-traded funds)? Generally the brochure illustrates\nthe product’s performance in recent years, going back just far enough for the\nnicest possible upward curve to emerge. This is also \nframing\n. Another example is\na simple piece of bread. Depending on how it is \nframed\n, as either the ‘symbolic’\nor the ‘true’ body of Christ, it can split a religion, as happened in the sixteenth\ncentury with the Reformation.\nFraming\n is used to good effect in commerce, too. Consider used cars. You are\nled to focus on just a few factors, whether the message is delivered through a\nsalesman, a sign touting certain features, or even your own criteria. For example,\nif the car has low mileage and good tyres, you home in on this and overlook the\nstate of the engine, the brakes or the interior. Thus, the mileage and tyres become\nthe main selling points and frame our decision to buy. Such oversight is only\nnatural, though, since it is difﬁcult to take in all possible pros and cons.\nInterestingly, had other frames been used to tout the car we might have decided\nvery differently.\nAuthors are conscious framers, too. A crime novel would be rather dull if, from\npage one, the murder were shown as it happened – stab by stab, as it were. Even\nthough we eventually discover the motives and murder weapons, the novelist’s\nframing\n injects thrills and suspense into the story.\nIn conclusion: realise that whatever you communicate contains some element\nof \nframing\n, and that every fact – even if you hear it from a trusted friend or read it\nin a reputable newspaper – is subject to this effect, too. Even this chapter.\nSee also \nContrast Effect\n (ch. 10);\n Fear of Regret\n (ch. 82);\n Loss Aversion\n (ch. 32);\nReciprocity\n (ch. 6); \nThe Anchor\n (ch. 30); \nSleeper Effect\n (ch. 70)\n43\nWHY WATCHING AND WAITING IS TORTURE\nAction Bias\nIn a penalty situation in soccer, the ball takes less than 0.3 seconds to travel from\nthe player who kicks the ball to the goal. There is not enough time for the\ngoalkeeper to watch the ball’s trajectory. He must take a decision before the ball\nis kicked. Soccer players who take penalty kicks shoot one third of the time at the\nmiddle of the goal, one third of the time at the left and one third of the time at the\nright. Surely goalkeepers have spotted this, but what do they do? They dive either\nto the left or to the right. Rarely do they stay standing in the middle – even though\nroughly a third of all balls land there. Why on earth would they jeopardise saving\nthese penalties? The simple answer: appearance. It looks more impressive and\nfeels less embarrassing to dive to the wrong side than to freeze on the spot and\nwatch the ball sail past. This is the \naction bias\n: look active, even if it achieves\nnothing.\nThis study comes from the Israeli researcher Michael Bar-Eli, who evaluated\nhundreds of penalty shoot-outs. But not just goalkeepers fall victim to the \naction\nbias\n. Suppose a group of youths exits a nightclub and begins to argue, shouting\nat each other and gesturing wildly. The situation is close to escalating into an all-\nout brawl. The police ofﬁcers in the area – some young, some more senior – hold\nback, monitor the scene from a distance and intervene only when the ﬁrst\ncasualties appear. If no experienced ofﬁcers are involved, this situation often\nends differently: young, overzealous ofﬁcers succumb to the \naction bias\n and dive\nin immediately. A study has revealed that later intervention, thanks to the calming\npresence of senior officers, results in fewer casualties.\nThe \naction bias\n is accentuated when a situation is new or unclear. When\nstarting out, many investors act like the young, gung-ho police ofﬁcers outside the\nnightclub: they can’t yet judge the stock market so they compensate with a sort of\nhyperactivity. Of course this is a waste of time. As Charlie Munger sums up his\napproach to investing: ‘We’ve got?. . .?discipline in avoiding just doing any damn\nthing just because you can’t stand inactivity.’\nThe \naction bias\n exists even in the most educated circles. If a patient’s illness\ncannot yet be diagnosed with certainty, and doctors must choose between\nintervening (i.e. prescribing something) or waiting and seeing, they are prone to\ntaking action. Such decisions have nothing to do with proﬁteering, but rather with\nthe human tendency to want to do anything but sit and wait in the face of\nuncertainty.\nSo what accounts for this tendency? In our old hunter-gatherer environment\n(which suited us quite well), action trumped reﬂection. Lightning-fast reactions\nwere essential to survival; deliberation could be fatal. When our ancestors saw a\nsilhouette appear at the edge of the forest – something that looked a lot like a\nsabre-tooth tiger – they did not take a pew to muse over what it might be. They hit\nthe road – and fast. We are the descendants of these quick responders. Back\nthen, it was better to run away once too often. However, our world today is\ndifferent; it rewards reflection, even though our instincts may suggest otherwise.\nAlthough we now value contemplation more highly, outright inaction remains a\ncardinal sin. You get no honour, no medal, no statue with your name on it if you\nmake exactly the right decision by \nwaiting – \nfor the good of the company, the\nstate, even humanity. On the other hand, if you demonstrate decisiveness and\nquick judgement, and the situation improves (though perhaps coincidentally), it’s\nquite possible your boss, or even the mayor, will shake your hand. Society at\nlarge still prefers rash action to a sensible wait-and-see strategy.\nIn conclusion: in new or shaky circumstances, we feel compelled to do\nsomething, anything. Afterward we feel better, even if we have made things worse\nby acting too quickly or too often. So, though it might not merit a parade in your\nhonour, if a situation is unclear, hold back until you can assess your options. ‘All\nof humanity’s problems stem from man’s inability to sit quietly in a room alone,’\nwrote Blaise Pascal. At home, in his study.\nSee also \nOmission Bias\n (ch. 44);\n Overthinking\n (ch. 90);\n Procrastination\n (ch. 85); \nThe\nIt’ll-Get-Worse-Before-It-Gets-Better Fallacy\n (ch. 12); \nInability to Close Doors\n (ch. 68)\n44\nWHY YOU ARE EITHER THE SOLUTION – OR THE PROBLEM\nOmission Bias\nYou are on a glacier with two climbers. The first slips and falls into a crevasse. He\nmight survive if you call for help, but you don’t, and he perishes. The second\nclimber you actively push into the ravine, and he dies shortly afterwards. Which\nweighs more heavily on your conscience?\nConsidering the options rationally, it’s obvious that both are equally\nreprehensible, resulting as they do in death for your companions. And yet\nsomething makes us rate the ﬁrst option, the passive option, as less horrible. This\nfeeling is called the \nomission bias\n. It crops up where both action and inaction\nlead to cruel consequences. In such cases, we tend to prefer inaction; its results\nseem more anodyne.\nSuppose you are the head of the Federal Drug Administration. You must\ndecide whether or not to approve a drug for the terminally ill. The pills can have\nfatal side effects: they kill 20% of patients on the spot, but save the lives of the\nother 80% within a short period of time. What do you decide?\nMost would withhold approval. To them, waving through a drug that takes out\nevery ﬁfth person is a worse act than failing to administer the cure to the other\n80% of patients. It is an absurd decision, and a perfect example of the \nomission\nbias\n. Suppose that you are aware of the bias\n \nand decide to approve the drug in\nthe name of reason and decency. Bravo. But what happens when the ﬁrst patient\ndies? A media storm ensues, and soon you ﬁnd yourself out of a job. As a civil\nservant or politician, you would do well to take the ubiquitous \nomission bias\nseriously – and even foster it.\nCase law shows how ingrained such ‘moral distortion’ is in our society. Active\neuthanasia, even if it is the explicit wish of the dying, is punishable by law,\nwhereas deliberate refusal of life-saving measures is legal (for example, following\nso-called DNR orders – do not resuscitate).\nSuch thinking also explains why parents feel it is perfectly acceptable not to\nvaccinate their children, even though vaccination discernibly reduces the risk of\ncatching the disease. Of course, there is also a very small risk of getting sick from\nthe vaccine. Overall, however, vaccination makes sense. Vaccination not only\nprotects the children, but society too. A person who is immune to the disease will\nnever infect others. Objectively, if non-vaccinated children ever contracted one of\nthese sicknesses, we could accuse the parents of actively harming them. But this\nis exactly the point: Deliberate inaction somehow seems less grave than a\ncomparable action – say, if the parents intentionally infected them.\nThe \nomission bias\n lies behind the following delusions: we wait until people\nshoot themselves in the foot rather than taking aim ourselves. Investors and\nbusiness journalists are more lenient on companies that develop no new\nproducts than they are on those that produce bad ones, even though both roads\nlead to ruin. Sitting passively on a bunch of miserable shares feels better than\nactively buying bad ones. Building no emission ﬁlter into a coal plant feels\nsuperior to removing one for cost reasons. Failing to insulate your house is more\nacceptable than burning the spared fuel for your own amusement. Neglecting to\ndeclare income tax is less immoral than faking tax documents, even though the\nstate loses out either way.\nIn the previous chapter, we met the \naction bias\n. Is it the opposite of the\nomission bias\n? Not quite. The action bias causes us to offset a lack of clarity with\nfutile hyperactivity, and comes into play when a situation is fuzzy, muddy or\ncontradictory The \nomission bias\n, on the other hand, usually abounds where the\nsituation is intelligible: a future misfortune might be averted with direct action, but\nthis insight doesn’t motivate us as much as it should.\nThe \nomission bias\n is very difﬁcult to detect – after all, action is more noticeable\nthan inaction. In the 1960s student movements coined a punchy slogan to\ncondemn it: ‘If you’re not part of the solution, you’re part of the problem.’\nSee also \nVolunteer’s Folly\n (ch. 65);\n Action Bias\n (ch. 43); \nProcrastination\n (ch. 85)\n45\nDON’T BLAME ME\nSelf-Serving Bias\nDo you ever read annual reports, paying particular attention to the CEO’s\ncomments? No? That’s a pity, because there you’ll ﬁnd countless examples of\nthis next error, which we all fall for at one time or another. For example, if the\ncompany has enjoyed an excellent year, the CEO catalogues his indispensable\ncontributions: his brilliant decisions, tireless efforts and cultivation of a dynamic\ncorporate culture. However, if the company has had a miserable year, we read\nabout all sorts of other dynamics: the unfortunate exchange rate, governmental\ninterference, the malicious trade practices of the Chinese, various hidden tariffs,\nsubdued consumer conﬁdence and so on. In short: we attribute success to\nourselves and failures to external factors. This is the \nself-serving bias\n.\nEven if you have never heard the expression, you deﬁnitely know the \nself-\nserving bias\n from high school. If you got an A, you were solely responsible; the\ntop grade reﬂected your intelligence, hard work and skill. And if you ﬂunked? The\ntest was clearly unfair.\nBut grades don’t matter to you any more: perhaps the stock market has taken\ntheir place. There, if you make a proﬁt, you applaud yourself. If your portfolio\nperforms miserably, the blame lies exclusively with ‘the market’ (whatever you\nimply by this) – or maybe that useless investment adviser. I, too, have periods\nwhere I’m a power user of the \nself-serving bias\n: if my new novel rockets up the\nbestseller list, I clap myself on the shoulder. Surely this is my best book yet! But, if\nit disappears in the ﬂood of new releases, it is because the readers simply don’t\nrecognise good literature when they see it. And if critics slay it, it is clearly a case\nof jealousy.\nTo investigate this bias, researchers put together a personality test and\nafterward, allocated the participants good or bad scores at random. Those who\ngot scored highly found the test thorough and fair; low scorers rated it completely\nuseless. So why do we attribute success to our own skill and ascribe failure to\nother factors? There are many theories. The simplest explanation is probably this:\nit feels good. Plus, it doesn’t cause any major harm. If it did, evolution would have\neliminated it over the past hundred thousand years. But beware: in a modern\nworld with many hidden risks, the \nself-serving bias \ncan quickly lead to\ncatastrophe. Richard Fuld, the self-titled ‘master of the universe’, might well\nendorse this. He was the almighty CEO of the investment bank Lehman Brothers\nuntil it went bankrupt in 2008. It would not surprise me if he still called himself\n‘master of the universe’, blaming government inaction for the bank’s collapse.\nIn SAT tests, students can score between 200 and 800 points. When asked\ntheir results a year later, they tend to boost their scores by around 50 points.\nInterestingly, they are neither lying nor exaggerating; they are simply ‘enhancing’\nthe result a little – until they start to believe the new score themselves.\nIn the building where I live, ﬁve students share an apartment. I meet them now\nand again in the elevator, and I decided to ask them separately how often they\ntake out the trash. One said he did it every second time. Another: every third time.\nRoommate #3, cursing because his garbage bag had split, reckoned he did it\npretty much every time, say 90%. Although their answers should have added up\nto 100%, these boys achieved an impressive 320%! The ﬁve systematically\noverestimated their roles – and so, are no different to any of us. In married\ncouples, the same thing happens: it’s been shown that both men and women\noverestimate their contribution to the health of the marriage. Each assumes their\ninput is more than 50%.\nSo, how can we dodge the \nself-serving bias\n? Do you have friends who tell you\nthe truth – no holds barred? If so, consider yourself lucky. If not, do you have at\nleast one enemy? Good. Invite him or her over for coffee and ask for an honest\nopinion about your strengths and weaknesses. You will be forever grateful you\ndid.\nSee also \nHindsight Bias\n (ch. 14);\n Overconfidence Effect\n (ch. 15); \nNot-Invented-Here\nSyndrome\n (ch. 74); \nSurvivorship Bias\n (ch. 1); \nBeginner’s Luck\n (ch. 49); \nCognitive\nDissonance\n (ch. 50); \nForer Effect\n (ch. 64); \nIntrospection Ilusion\n (ch. 67); \nCherry-Picking\n(ch. 96)\n46\nBE CAREFUL WHAT YOU WISH FOR\nHedonic Treadmill\nSuppose one day, the phone rings. An excited voice tells you that you have just\nscooped the lottery jackpot – $10 million! How would you feel? And, how long\nwould you feel like that? Another scenario. The phone rings and you learn that\nyour best friend has passed away. Again, how would you feel, and for how long?\nIn chapter 40, we examined the miserable accuracy of predictions, for example\nin the ﬁelds of politics, economics and social events. We concluded that self-\nappointed experts are of no more use than a random forecast generator. So,\nmoving on to a new area: how well can we predict our feelings? Are we experts\non ourselves? Would winning the lottery make us the happiest people alive for\nyears to come? Harvard psychologist Dan Gilbert says no. He has studied lottery\nwinners and discovered that the happiness effect ﬁzzles out after a few months.\nSo, a little while after you receive the big cheque, you will be as content or as\ndiscontent as you were before. He calls this ‘affective forecasting’; our inability to\ncorrectly predict our own emotions.\nA friend, a banking executive, whose enormous income was beginning to burn\na hole in his pocket, decided to build himself a new home away from the city. His\ndream materialised into a villa with ten rooms, a swimming pool and an enviable\nview of the lake and mountains. For the ﬁrst few weeks, he beamed with delight.\nBut soon the cheerfulness disappeared, and six months later he was unhappier\nthan ever. What happened? As we now know, the happiness effect evaporates\nafter a few months. The villa was no longer his dream. ‘I come home from work,\nopen the door and?. . .?nothing. I feel as indifferent about the villa as I did about\nmy one-room student apartment.’ To make things worse, the poor guy now faced\na one-hour commute twice a day. This may sound tolerable, but studies show that\ncommuting by car represents a major source of discontent and stress, and people\nhardly ever get used to it. In other words, whoever has no innate afﬁnity for\ncommuting will suffer every day – twice a day. Anyhow, the moral of the story is\nthat the dream villa had an overall negative effect on my friend’s happiness.\nMany others fare no better: People who change or progress in their careers are,\nin terms of happiness, right back where they started after around three months.\nThe same goes for people who buy the latest Porsche. Science calls this effect\nthe \nhedonic treadmill\n: we work hard, advance and are able to afford more and\nnicer things, and yet this doesn’t make us any happier.\nSo how do negative events affect us – say, a spinal cord injury or the loss of a\nfriend? Here, we also overestimate the duration and intensity of future emotions.\nFor example, when a relationship ends it feels like life will never be the same.\nThe afﬂicted are completely convinced that they will never again experience joy,\nbut after three or so months they are back on the dating scene.\nWouldn’t it be nice if we knew exactly how happy a new car, career or\nrelationship would make us? Well, this is doable in part. Use these scientiﬁcally\nrubber-stamped pointers to make better, brighter decisions: 1) Avoid negative\nthings that you cannot grow accustomed to, such as commuting, noise or chronic\nstress. 2) Expect only short-term happiness from material things, such as cars,\nhouses, lottery winnings, bonuses and prizes. 3) Aim for as much free time and\nautonomy as possible, since long-lasting positive effects generally come from\nwhat you actively do. Follow your passions even if you must forfeit a portion of\nyour income for them. Invest in friendships.\nFor most people, professional status\nachieves long-lasting happiness, as long as they don’t change peer groups at the\nsame time. In other words, if you ascend to a CEO role and fraternise only with\nother executives, the effect fizzles out.\nSee also \nForecast Illusion\n (ch. 40);\n Neomania\n (ch. 69); \nEnvy\n (ch. 86)\n47\nDO NOT MARVEL AT YOUR EXISTENCE\nSelf-Selection Bias\nTravelling from Philadelphia up to New York, I got stuck in a trafﬁc jam. ‘Why is it\nalways me?’ I groaned. Glancing to the opposite side of the road, I saw carefree\nsouthbound drivers racing past with enviable speed. As I spent the next hour\ncrawling forward at a snail’s pace, and started to grow restless from braking and\naccelerating, I asked myself whether I really was especially unlucky. Do I always\npick the worst lines at the bank, post ofﬁce and grocery store? Or do I just \nthink\n I\ndo?\nSuppose that, on this highway, a trafﬁc jam develops 10% of the time. The\nprobability that I will get stuck in a jam on a particular day is not greater than the\nprobability that one will occur. However, the likelihood that I will get stuck at a\ncertain point in my journey is greater than 10%. The reason: because I can only\ncrawl forward when in a trafﬁc jam, I spend a disproportionate amount of time in\nthis state. In addition, if the trafﬁc is zooming along, the prospect never crosses\nmy mind. But the moment it arises and I am stuck, I notice it.\nThe same applies to the lines at bank counters or trafﬁc lights. Let’s say the\nroute between point A and point B has ten traffic lights. On average, one out of the\nten will always be red and the others green. However, you might spend more than\n10% of your total travel time waiting at a red light. If this doesn’t seem right,\nimagine that you are travelling at near the speed of light. In this case, you would\nspend 99.99% (not 10%) of your total journey time waiting and cursing in front of\nred traffic lights.\nWhenever we complain about bad luck, we must be wary of the so-called \nself-\nselection bias\n. My male friends often gripe about there being too few women in\ntheir companies, and my female friends groan that theirs have too few men. This\nhas nothing to do with bad luck: the grumblers form part of the sample. The\nprobability is high that a man will work in a mostly male industry. Ditto for women.\nOn a grander scale, if you live in a country with a large proportion of men or\nwomen (such as China or Russia, respectively), you are likely to form part of the\nbigger group and accordingly feel hard done by. In elections, it is most probable\nthat you will choose the largest party. In voting, it is most likely that your vote\ncorresponds with the winning majority.\nThe \nself-selection bias \nis pervasive. Marketers sometimes stumble into the trap\nin this way: to analyse how much customers value their newsletter, they send out\na questionnaire. Unfortunately, this reaches only one group: current subscribers,\nwho are clearly satisﬁed, have time to respond and have not cancelled their\nsubscriptions. The others make up no part of the sample. Result: the poll is\nworthless.\nNot too long ago, a rather maudlin friend remarked that it bordered on the\nmiraculous that he – yes, he! – ever existed. A classic victim of the \nself-selection\nbias\n. Only someone who is alive can make such an observation. Nonentities\ngenerally don’t consider their non-existence for too long. And yet, precisely the\nsame delusion forms the basis of at least a dozen philosophers’ books, as they\nmarvel year in, year out at the development of language. I’m quite sympathetic to\ntheir amazement, but it is simply not justiﬁed. If language did not exist,\nphilosophers could not revere it at all – in fact, there would be no philosophers.\nThe miracle of language is tangible only in the environment in which it exists.\nParticularly amusing is this recent telephone survey: a company wanted to ﬁnd\nout, on average, how many phones (landline and cell) each household owned.\nWhen the results were tallied, the ﬁrm was amazed that not a single household\nclaimed to have no phone. What a masterpiece.\nSee also \nAlternative Paths\n (ch. 39); \nFeature-Positive Effect\n (ch. 95); \nSwimmer’s Body\nIllusion\n (ch. 2)\n48\nWHY EXPERIENCE CAN DAMAGE OUR JUDGEMENT\nAssociation Bias\nKevin has presented his division’s results to the company’s board on three\noccasions. Each time, things have gone perfectly. And, each time, he has worn\nhis green polka-dot boxer shorts. It’s ofﬁcial, he thinks: these are my lucky\nunderpants.\nThe girl in the jewellery store was so stunning that Kevin couldn’t help buying\nthe $10,000 engagement ring she showed him. Ten thousand bucks was way\nover his budget (especially for a second marriage), but for some reason he\nassociated the ring with her and imagined his future wife would be just as\ndazzling.\nEach year, Kevin goes to the doctor for a check-up. Generally, he is told that,\nfor a man of 44, he is still in pretty good shape. Only twice has he left the practice\nwith worrying news. Once the problem was his appendix, which was promptly\nremoved. The other time it was a swollen prostate, which, upon further inspection,\nturned out to be a simple inﬂammation rather than cancer. Of course, on both\noccasions, Kevin was beside himself with worry when leaving the clinic – and\ncoincidentally, both days were extremely hot. Since then, he has always felt\nuncomfortable on very warm days. If the temperature starts to heat up around one\nof his check-ups, he cancels straight away.\nOur brain is a connection machine. This is quite practical: if we eat an unknown\nfruit and feel sick afterward, we avoid it in future, labelling the plant poisonous or\nat least unpalatable. This is how knowledge comes to be. However, this method\nalso creates false knowledge. Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov was the ﬁrst to\nconduct research into this phenomenon. His original goal was to measure\nsalivation in dogs. He used a bell to call the dogs to eat, but soon the ringing\nsound alone was enough to make the dogs salivate. The animals’ brains linked\ntwo functionally unrelated things – the ringing of a bell and the production of\nsaliva.\nPavlov’s method works equally well with humans. Advertising creates a link\nbetween products and emotions. For this reason, you will never see Coke\nalongside a frowning face or a wrinkly body. Coke people are young, beautiful\nand oh so fun, and they appear in clusters not seen in the real world.\nThese false connections are the work of the \nassociation bias\n, which also\ninﬂuences the quality of our decisions. For example, we often condemn bearers\nof bad news, since we automatically associate them with the message’s content\n(otherwise known as \nshoot-the-messenger syndrome\n). Sometimes, CEOs and\ninvestors (unconsciously) steer clear of these harbingers, meaning the only news\nthat reaches the upper echelons is positive, thus creating a distorted view of the\nreal situation. If you lead a group of people, and don’t want to fall prey to false\nconnections, direct your staff to tell you only the bad news – and fast. With this,\nyou overcompensate for the \nshoot-the-messenger syndrome\n and, believe me, you\nwill still hear enough positive news.\nIn the days before email and telemarketing, travelling salesmen went door to\ndoor peddling their wares. One day, a particular salesman, George Foster, stood\nat a front door. The house turned out to be vacant, and unbeknownst to him, a tiny\nleak had been ﬁlling it with gas for weeks. The bell was also damaged, so when\nhe pressed it, it created a spark and the house exploded. Poor George ended up\nin hospital, but fortunately he was soon back on his feet. Unfortunately, his fear of\nringing doorbells had become so strong that for many years he couldn’t go back\nto his job. He knew how unlikely a repeat of the incident was, but for all he tried,\nhe just couldn’t manage to reverse the (false) emotional connection.\nThe take-home message from all this is phrased most aptly by Mark Twain: ‘We\nshould be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it – and\nstop there; lest we be like the cat that sits down on a hot stove-lid. She will never\nsit down on a hot stove-lid again – and that is well; but also she will never sit\ndown on a cold one anymore.’\nSee also \nContagion Bias\n (ch. 54);\n False Causality\n (ch. 37); \nBeginner’s Luck\n (ch. 49);\nAvailability Bias\n (ch. 11); \nAffect Heuristic\n (ch. 66)\n49\nBE WARY WHEN THINGS GET OFF TO A GREAT START\nBeginner’s Luck\nIn the last chapter, we learned about the \nassociation bias\n – the tendency to see\nconnections where none exist. For example, regardless of how many big\npresentations he has nailed while wearing them, Kevin’s green polka-dot\nunderpants are no guarantee of success.\nWe now come to a particularly tricky branch of the \nassociation bias\n: creating a\n(false) link with the \npast\n. Casino players know this well; they call it \nbeginner’s\nluck\n. People who are new to a game and lose in the ﬁrst few rounds are usually\nclever enough to fold. But whoever strikes lucky tends to keep going. Convinced\nof their above-average skills, these amateurs increase the stakes – but they will\nsoon get a sobering wake-up call when the probabilities ‘normalise’.\nBeginner’s luck\n plays an important role in the economy. Say company A buys\nsmaller companies B, C and D one after the other. The acquisitions prove a\nsuccess, and the directors believe they have a real skill for acquisitions. Buoyed\nby this conﬁdence, they now buy a much larger company, E. The integration is a\ndisaster. The merger proves too difﬁcult to handle, the estimated synergies\nimpossible to realise. Objectively speaking, this was foreseeable because in the\nprevious acquisitions everything fell perfectly into place as if guided by a magical\nhand, so \nbeginner’s luck \nblinded them.\nThe same goes for the stock exchange. Driven by initial success, many\ninvestors pumped their life savings into Internet stocks in the late 1990s. Some\neven took out loans to capitalise on the opportunity. However, these investors\noverlooked one tiny detail: their amazing proﬁts at the time had nothing to do with\ntheir stock-picking abilities. The market was simply on an upward spiral. Even the\nmost clueless investors won big. When the market ﬁnally turned downward, many\nwere left facing mountains of dot-com debt.\nWe witnessed the same delusions during the recent U.S. housing boom.\nDentists, lawyers, teachers and taxi drivers gave up their jobs to ‘ﬂip’ houses – to\nbuy them and resell them straight away at higher prices. The ﬁrst fat proﬁts\njustiﬁed their career changes, but of course these gains had nothing to do with\nany speciﬁc skills. The housing bubble allowed even the most inept amateur\nbrokers to ﬂourish. Many investors became deeply indebted as they ﬂipped even\nmore and even bigger mansions. When the bubble ﬁnally burst, many were left\nwith only a string of unsellable properties to their names.\nIn fact, history has no shortage of \nbeginner’s luck\n: I doubt whether Napoleon or\nHitler would have dared launch a campaign against the Russians without the\nprevious victories in smaller battles to bolster them.\nBut how do you tell the difference between \nbeginner’s luck\n and the ﬁrst signs of\nreal talent? There is no clear rule, but these two tips may help: ﬁrst, if you are\nmuch better than others over a long period of time, you can be fairly sure that\ntalent plays a part. (Unfortunately, though, you can never be 100%.) Second, the\nmore people competing, the greater the chances are that one of them will\nrepeatedly strike lucky. Perhaps even you. If, among ten competitors, you\nestablish yourself as a market leader over many years, you can clap yourself on\nthe back. That’s a sure indication of talent. But, if you are top dog among 10\nmillion players (i.e. in the ﬁnancial markets) in one particular year, you shouldn’t\nstart visualising a Buffettesque ﬁnancial empire just yet; it’s extremely likely that\nyou have simply been very fortunate.\nWatch and wait before you draw any conclusions. \nBeginner’s luck\n can be\ndevastating, so guard against misconceptions by treating your theories as a\nscientist would: try to disprove them. As soon as my ﬁrst novel, \nThirty-five\n, was\nready to go, I sent it to a single publisher, where it was promptly accepted. For a\nmoment I felt like a genius, a literary sensation. (The chance that this publisher\nwill take on a manuscript is one in 15,000.) To test my theory, I then sent the\nmanuscript to ten other big publishers. And I got ten rejection letters. My notion\nwas thus disproven, bringing me swiftly back down to earth.\nSee also \nSurvivorship Bias\n (ch. 1);\n Self-Serving Bias\n (ch. 45); \nAssociation Bias\n (ch. 48);\nFalse Causality\n (ch. 37); \nIllusion of Skill\n (ch. 94)\n50\nSWEET LITTLE LIES\nCognitive Dissonance\nA fox crept up to a vine. He gazed longingly at the fat, purple, overripe grapes. He\nplaced his front paws against the trunk of the vine, stretched his neck and tried to\nget at the fruit, but it was too high. Irritated, he tried his luck again. He launched\nhimself upward, but his jaw snapped only at fresh air. A third time he leapt with all\nhis might – so powerfully that he landed back down on the ground with a thud.\nStill not a single leaf had stirred. The fox turned up his nose: ‘These aren’t even\nripe yet. Why would I want sour grapes?’ Holding his head high, he strode back\ninto the forest.\nThe Greek poet, Aesop, created this fable to illustrate one of the most common\nerrors in reasoning. An inconsistency arose when the fox set out to do something\nand failed to accomplish it. He can resolve this conﬂict in one of three ways: A) by\nsomehow getting at the grapes, B) by admitting that his skills are insufﬁcient, or\nC) by retrospectively reinterpreting what happened. The last option is an example\nof \ncognitive dissonance\n, or rather, its resolution.\nSuppose you buy a new car. However, you regret your choice soon afterward:\nthe engine sounds like a jet taking off and you just can’t get comfortable in the\ndriver’s seat. What do you do? Giving the car back would be an admission of\nerror (you don’t want that!), and anyway, the dealer probably wouldn’t refund all\nthe money. So you tell yourself that a loud engine and awkward seats are great\nsafety features that will prevent you from falling asleep at the wheel. Not so stupid\nafter all, you think, and you are suddenly proud of your sound, practical purchase.\nLeon Festinger and Merrill Carlsmith of Stanford University once asked their\nstudents to carry out an hour of excruciatingly boring tasks. They then divided the\nsubjects into two groups. Each student in group A received a dollar (it was 1959)\nand instructions to wax lyrical about the work to another student waiting outside –\nin other words, to lie. The same was asked of the students in group B, with one\ndifference: they were given $20 for the task. Later, the students had to divulge\nhow they had really found the monotonous work. Interestingly, those who\nreceived only a dollar rated it as signiﬁcantly more enjoyable and interesting.\nWhy? One measly dollar was not enough for them to lie outright; instead they\nconvinced themselves that the work was not that bad. Just as Aesop’s fox\nreinterpreted the situation, so did they. The students who received more didn’t\nhave to justify anything. They had lied and netted $20 for it – a fair deal. They\nexperienced no \ncognitive dissonance\n.\nSuppose you apply for a job and discover you have lost out to another\ncandidate. Instead of admitting that the other person was better suited, you\nconvince yourself that you didn’t want the job in the ﬁrst place; you simply wanted\nto test your ‘market value’ and see if you could get invited for interview.\nI reacted very similarly some time ago when I had to choose between investing\nin two different stocks. My chosen stock lost much of its value shortly after the\npurchase, whereas shares in the other stock, the one I hadn’t invested in,\nskyrocketed. I couldn’t bring myself to admit my error. Quite the reverse, in fact: I\ndistinctly remember trying to convince a friend that, though the stock was\nexperiencing teething problems, it still had more potential overall. Only \ncognitive\ndissonance\n can explain this remarkably irrational reaction. The ‘potential’ would\nindeed have been even greater if I had postponed the decision to purchase the\nshares until today. It was that friend who told me the Aesop fable. ‘You can play\nthe clever fox all you want – but you’ll never get the grapes that way.’\nSee also \nEndowment Effect\n (ch. 23);\n Self-Serving Bias\n (ch. 45); \nConfirmation Bias\n (ch.\n7–8); \n‘Because’ Justification\n (ch. 52); \nEffort Justification\n (ch. 60)\n51\nLIVE EACH DAY AS IF IT WERE YOUR LAST – BUT ONLY ON\nSUNDAYS\nHyperbolic Discounting\nYou know the saying: ‘Live each day as if it were your last.’ It features at least\nthree times in every lifestyle magazine, and has a slot in every self-help manual’s\nstandard repertoire, too. For such a clever line, it makes you none the wiser. Just\nimagine what would happen if you followed it to the letter: you would no longer\nbrush your teeth, wash your hair, clean the apartment, turn up for work, pay the\nbills?. . .?In no time, you would be broke, sick and perhaps even behind bars.\nAnd yet, its meaning is inherently noble. It expresses a deep longing, a desire for\nimmediacy. We place huge value on immediacy – much more than is justiﬁable.\n‘Enjoy each day to the fullest and don’t worry about tomorrow’ is simply not a\nsmart way to live.\nWould you rather receive $1,000 in a year or $1,100 in a year and a month?\nMost people will opt for the larger sum in thirteen months – where else will you\nfind a monthly interest rate of 10% (or 120% per annum!). A wise choice, since the\ninterest will compensate you generously for any risks you face by waiting the\nextra few weeks.\nSecond question: would you prefer $1,000 today cash on the table or $1,100 in\na month? If you think like most people, you’ll take the $1,000 straight away. This\nis amazing. In both cases, if you hold out for just a month longer, you get $100\nmore. In the ﬁrst case, it’s simple enough. You ﬁgure: ‘I’ve already waited twelve\nmonths; what’s one more?’ Not in the second case. The introduction of ‘now’\ncauses us to make inconsistent decisions. Science calls this phenomenon\nhyperbolic discounting\n. Put plainly, the closer a reward is, the higher our\n‘emotional interest rate’ rises and the more we are willing to give up in exchange\nfor it. The majority of economists have not yet grasped that we respond so\nsubjectively and inconsistently to interest rates. Their models still depend on\nconstant interest rates and are correspondingly questionable.\nHyperbolic discounting\n, the fact that immediacy magnetises us, is a remnant of\nour animal past. Animals will never turn down an instant reward in order to attain\nmore in the future. You can train rats as much as you like; they’re never going to\ngive up a piece of cheese today to get two pieces tomorrow. But wait a minute:\ndon’t squirrels manage to gather food and save it for much later? Yes, but that’s\npure instinct and – verifiably – has nothing to do with impulse control or learning.\nAnd what about children? In the 60s, Walter Mischel conducted a famous\nexperiment on delayed gratiﬁcation. You can ﬁnd a wonderful video of this on\nYouTube by typing in ‘marshmallow experiment’. In it, a group of four-year-olds\nwere each given a marshmallow. They could either eat it straight away or wait a\ncouple of minutes and receive a second. Amazingly, very few children could wait.\nEven more amazingly, Mischel found that the capacity for delayed gratiﬁcation is\na reliable indicator of future career success. Patience is indeed a virtue.\nThe older we get and the more self-control we build up, the more easily we can\ndelay rewards. Instead of twelve months, we happily wait thirteen to take home an\nadditional $100. However, if we are offered an instant reward, the incentive has to\nbe very high for us to postpone the fulﬁlment. Case in point: the exorbitant interest\nrates banks charge on credit-card debt and other short-term personal loans, both\nof which exploit our must-have-now instincts.\nIn conclusion: though instantaneous reward is incredibly tempting, \nhyperbolic\ndiscounting\n is still a ﬂaw. The more power we gain over our impulses, the better\nwe can avoid this trap. The less power we have over our impulses – for example\nwhen we are under the inﬂuence of alcohol – the more susceptible we are.\nViewed from the other side, if you sell consumer products, give customers the\noption of getting their hands on the items straight away. Some people will be\nwilling to pay extra just so they don’t have to wait. Amazon makes a bundle from\nthis: a healthy chunk of the next-day delivery surcharge goes directly into its\ncoffers. ‘Live each day as if it were your last’ is a good idea – once a week.\nSee also \nDecision Fatigue\n (ch. 53);\n Simple Logic\n (ch. 63);\n Procrastination\n (ch. 85)\n52\nANY LAME EXCUSE\n‘Because’ Justification\nTrafﬁc jam on the highway between Los Angeles and San Francisco: surface\nrepairs. I spent thirty minutes slowly battling my way through until the chaos was\na distant scene in my rear view mirror. Or so I thought. Half an hour later, I was\nagain bumper to bumper: more maintenance work. Strangely enough, my level of\nfrustration was much lower this time. Why? Reassuringly cheerful signs along the\nroad announced: ‘We’re renovating the highway for you!’\nThe jam reminded me of an experiment conducted by the Harvard psychologist\nEllen Langer in the 1970s. For this, she went into a library and waited at a\nphotocopier until a line had formed. Then she approached the ﬁrst in line and\nsaid: ‘Excuse me, I have ﬁve pages. May I use the Xerox machine?’ Her success\nrate was 60 per cent. She repeated the experiment, this time giving a reason:\n‘Excuse me. I have ﬁve pages. May I use the Xerox machine, because I’m in a\nrush?’ In almost all cases (94 per cent), she was allowed to go ahead. This is\nunderstandable: if people are in a hurry, you often let them cut in to the front of the\nline. She tried yet another approach, this time saying: ‘Excuse me. I have ﬁve\npages. May I go before you, because I have to make some copies?’ The result\nwas amazing. Even though the pretext was (ahem) paper-thin – after all,\neveryone was standing in line to make copies – she was allowed to pass to the\nfront of the line in almost all cases (93 per cent).\nWhen you justify your behaviour, you encounter more tolerance and\nhelpfulness. It seems to matter very little if your excuse is good or not. Using the\nsimple validation ‘because’ is sufficient. A sign proclaiming: ‘We’re renovating the\nhighway for you’ is completely redundant. What else would a maintenance crew\nbe up to on a highway? If you hadn’t noticed before, you realise what is going on\nonce you look out the window. And yet this knowledge reassures and calms you.\nAfter all, nothing is more frustrating than being kept in the dark.\nGate A57 at JFK airport, waiting to board. An announcement comes over the\nloudspeaker: ‘Attention, passengers. Flight 1234 is delayed by three hours.’\nWonderful. I walked to the desk to ﬁnd out why. And came back no more\nenlightened. I was furious: how dare they leave us waiting in ignorance? Other\nairlines have the decency to announce: ‘Flight 5678 is delayed by three hours\ndue to operational reasons.’ A throwaway reason if there ever was one, but\nenough to appease passengers.\nIt seems people are addicted to the word ‘because’ – so much so that we use it\neven when it’s not necessary. If you are a leader, undoubtedly you have\nwitnessed this. If you provide no rallying call, employee motivation dwindles. It\nsimply doesn’t make the grade to say that the purpose of your shoe company is to\nmanufacture footwear. No: today, higher purposes and the story behind the story\nare all-important; for example: ‘We want our shoes to revolutionise the market’\n(whatever that means). ‘Better arch support for a better world!’ (whatever that\nmeans). Zappo’s claims that it is in the happiness business (whatever that\nmeans).\nIf the stock market rises or falls by half a per cent, you will never hear the true\ncause from stock market commentators – that it is white noise, the culmination of\nan inﬁnite number of market movements. No: people want a palpable reason and\nthe commentator is happy to select one. Whatever explanation he utters will be\nmeaningless – with frequent blame applied to the pronouncements of Federal\nReserve Bank presidents.\nIf someone asks why you have yet to complete a task, it’s best to say: ‘Because\nI haven’t got around to it yet.’ It’s a pathetic excuse (had you done so, the\nconversation wouldn’t be taking place), but it usually does the trick without the\nneed to scramble for more plausible reasons.\nOne day I watched my wife carefully separating black laundry from blue. As far\nas I know, this effort isn’t necessary. Both are dark colours, right? Such logic has\nmanaged to keep my clothes run-free for many years. ‘Why do you do that?’ I\nasked. ‘Because I prefer to wash them separately.’ For me, a perfectly ﬁne\nanswer.\nNever leave home without ‘because’. This unassuming little word greases the\nwheels of human interaction. Use it unrestrainedly.\nSee also \nCognitive Dissonance\n (ch. 50); \nStory Bias\n (ch. 13); \nFallacy of the Single Cause\n(ch. 97)\n53\nDECIDE BETTER – DECIDE LESS\nDecision Fatigue\nFor weeks, you’ve been working to the point of exhaustion on this presentation.\nThe PowerPoint slides are polished. Each ﬁgure in Excel is indisputable. The\npitch is a paradigm of crystal-clear logic. Everything depends on your\npresentation. If you get the green light from the CEO, you’re on your way to a\ncorner ofﬁce. If the presentation ﬂops, you’re on your way to the unemployment\nofﬁce. The CEO’s assistant proposes the following times for the presentation:\n8.00a.m., 11.30a.m. or 6.00p.m. Which slot do you choose?\nThe psychologist Roy Baumeister and his collaborator Jean Twenge once\ncovered a table with hundreds of inexpensive items – from tennis balls and\ncandles to T-shirts, chewing gum and Coke cans. He divided his students into\ntwo groups. The ﬁrst group he labelled ‘deciders’, the second ‘non-deciders’. He\ntold the ﬁrst group: ‘I’m going to show you sets containing two random items and\neach time you have to decide which you prefer. At the end of the experiment I’ll\ngive you one item you can take home.’ They were led to believe that their choices\nwould inﬂuence which item they got to keep. To the second group, he said: ‘Write\ndown what you think about each item, and I’ll pick one and give it to you at the\nend.’ Immediately thereafter, he asked each student to put their hand in ice-cold\nwater and hold it there for as long as possible. In psychology, this is a classic\nmethod to measure willpower or self-discipline; if you have little or none, you\nyank your hand back out of the water very quickly. The result: the deciders pulled\ntheir hands out of the icy water much sooner than the non-deciders did. The\nintensive decision-making had drained their willpower – an effect conﬁrmed in\nmany other experiments.\nMaking decisions is exhausting. Anyone who has ever conﬁgured a laptop\nonline or researched a long trip – ﬂight, hotels, activities, restaurants, weather –\nknows this well: after all the comparing, considering and choosing, you are\nexhausted. Science calls this \ndecision fatigue\n.\nDecision fatigue\n is perilous: as a consumer, you become more susceptible to\nadvertising messages and impulse buys. As a decision-maker, you are more\nprone to erotic seduction. Willpower is like a battery. After a while it runs out and\nneeds to be recharged. How do you do this? By taking a break, relaxing and\neating something. Willpower plummets to zero if your blood sugar falls too low.\nIKEA knows this only too well. On the trek through its maze-like display areas and\ntowering warehouse shelves, \ndecision fatigue\n sets in. For this reason, its\nrestaurants are located right in the middle of the stores. The company is willing to\nsacriﬁce some of its proﬁt margin so that you can top up your blood sugar on\nSwedish treats before resuming your hunt for the perfect candlesticks.\nFour prisoners in an Israeli jail petitioned the court for early release. Case 1\n(scheduled for 8.50a.m.): an Arab sentenced to 30 months in prison for fraud.\nCase 2 (scheduled for 1.27p.m.): a Jew sentenced to 16 months for assault. Case\n3 (scheduled for 3.10p.m.): a Jew sentenced to 16 months for assault. Case 4\n(scheduled for 4.35p.m.): an Arab sentenced to 30 months for fraud. How did the\njudges decide? More signiﬁcant than the detainees’ allegiance or the severity of\ntheir crimes was the judges’ \ndecision fatigue\n. The judges granted requests 1 and\n2 because their blood sugar was still high (from breakfast or lunch). However,\nthey struck out applications 3 and 4 because they could not summon enough\nenergy to risk the consequences of an early release. They took the easy option\n(the status quo) and the men remained in jail. A study of hundreds of verdicts\nshows that within a session, the percentage of ‘courageous’ judicial decisions\ngradually drops from 65% to almost zero, and after a recess, returns to 65%. So\nmuch for the careful deliberations of Lady Justice. But, as long as you have no\nupcoming trials, all is not lost: you now know when to present your project to the\nCEO.\nSee also \nParadox of Choice\n (ch. 21); \nHyperbolic Discounting\n (ch. 51); \nSimple Logic\n (ch.\n63); \nDefault Effect\n (ch. 81)\n54\nWOULD YOU WEAR HITLER’S SWEATER?\nContagion Bias\nFollowing the collapse of the Carolingian Empire in the ninth century, Europe,\nespecially France, descended into anarchy. Counts, commanders, knights and\nother local rulers were perpetually embroiled in battles. The ruthless warriors\nlooted farms, raped women, trampled ﬁelds, kidnapped pastors and set convents\nalight. Both the church and the unarmed farmers were powerless against the\nnobles’ savage warmongering.\nIn the tenth century, a French bishop had an idea. He asked the princes and\nknights to assemble in a ﬁeld. Meanwhile, priests, bishops and abbots gathered\nall the relics that they could muster from the area and displayed them there. It was\na striking sight: bones, blood-soaked rags, bricks and tiles – anything that had\never come in contact with a saint. The bishop, at that time a person who\ncommanded respect, then called upon the nobles, in the presence of the relics, to\nrenounce unbridled violence and attacks against the unarmed. In order to add\nweight to his demand, he waved the bloody clothes and holy bones in front of\nthem. The nobles must have had enormous reverence for such symbols: the\nbishop’s unique appeal to their conscience spread throughout Europe, promoting\nthe ‘Peace and Truce of God’. ‘One\nshould never underestimate the fear of saints\nin the Middle Ages and of saints’ relics,’ says American historian Philip\nDaileader.\nAs an enlightened person, you can only laugh at this silly superstition. But wait:\nwhat if I put it to you this way? Would you put on a freshly laundered sweater that\nHitler had once worn? Probably not, right? So, it seems that you haven’t lost all\nrespect for intangible forces, either. Essentially, this sweater has nothing to do\nwith Hitler any more. There isn’t a single molecule of Hitler’s sweat on it.\nHowever, the prospect of putting it on still puts you off. It’s more than just a matter\nof respect. Yes, we want to project a ‘correct’ image to our fellow humans and to\nourselves, but the thought puts us off even when we are alone and when we\nconvince ourselves that touching this sweater does not endorse Hitler in any way.\nThis emotional reaction is difﬁcult to override. Even those who consider\nthemselves quite rational have a hard time completely banishing the belief in\nmysterious forces (me included).\nMysterious powers of this kind can’t simply be switched off. Paul Rozin and his\nresearch colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania asked test subjects to\nbring in photos of loved ones. These were pinned to the centre of targets and the\nsubjects had to shoot darts at them. Riddling a picture with darts does no harm to\nthe person in it, but nevertheless the subjects’ hesitation was palpable. They\nwere much less accurate than a control group that had shot at regular targets\nbeforehand. The test subjects behaved as if a mystic force prevented them from\nhitting the photos.\nThe \ncontagion bias\n describes how we are incapable of ignoring the connection\nwe feel to certain items – be they from long ago or only indirectly related (as with\nthe photos). A friend was a long-time war correspondent for the French public\ntelevision channel France 2. Just as passengers on a Caribbean cruise take\nhome souvenirs from each island – a straw hat or a painted coconut – my friend\nalso collected mementoes from her adventures. One of her last missions was to\nBaghdad in 2003. A few hours after American troops stormed Saddam Hussein’s\ngovernment palace, she crept into the private quarters. In the dining room, she\nspotted six gold-plated wine glasses and promptly commandeered them. When I\nattended one of her dinner parties in Paris recently, the gilded goblets had pride\nof place on the dining table. ‘Are these from Lafayette?’ one person asked. ‘No,\nthey are from Saddam Hussein,’ she said candidly. A horriﬁed guest spat his\nwine back into the glass and began to splutter uncontrollably. I had to contribute:\n‘You realise how many molecules you’ve already shared with Saddam, simply by\nbreathing?’ I asked. ‘About a billion per breath.’ His cough got even worse.\nSee also \nAssociation Bias\n (ch. 48);\n Affect Heuristic\n (ch. 66)\n55\nWHY THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS AN AVERAGE WAR\nThe Problem with Averages\nSuppose you’re on a bus with forty-nine other people. At the next stop, the\nheaviest person in America gets on. Question: by how much has the average\nweight of the passengers increased? Four per cent? Five? Something like that.\nSuppose the bus stops again, and on gets Bill Gates. This time we are not\nconcerned about weight. Question: by how much has the average \nwealth\n risen?\nFour per cent? Five? Far from it!\nLet’s calculate the second example quickly. Suppose each of ﬁfty randomly\nselected individuals has assets of $54,000. This is the statistical middle value,\nthe median. Then Bill Gates is added to the mix, with his fortune of around $59\nbillion. The average wealth has just shot up to $1.15 billion, an increase of more\nthan two million per cent. A single outlier has radically altered the picture,\nrendering the term ‘average’ completely meaningless.\n‘Don’t\ncross a river if it is (\non average\n) four feet deep,’ warns Nassim Taleb,\nfrom whom I have the above examples. The river can be very shallow – mere\ninches – for long stretches, but it might transform into a raging torrent that is\ntwenty feet deep in the middle, in which case you could easily drown. Dealing in\naverages is a risky undertaking because they often mask the underlying\ndistribution – the way the values stack up.\nAnother example: the average amount of UV rays you are exposed to on a\nJune day is not harmful to your health. But if you were to spend the entire summer\nin a darkened ofﬁce, then ﬂy to Barbados and lie in the sun without sunscreen for\na week solid, you would have a problem – even though, on average over the\nsummer, you were not getting more UV light than someone who was outside\nregularly.\nAll this is quite straightforward and maybe you were aware of it already. For\nexample, you drink one glass of red wine at dinner every evening. That’s not a\nhealth issue. Many doctors recommend it. But if you drink no alcohol the entire\nyear and on Dec 31 you gulp 356 glasses, which is equivalent to sixty bottles,\nyou will have a problem, although the \naverage\n over the year is the same.\nHere’s the update: in a complex world, distribution is becoming more and more\nirregular. In other words, we will observe the Bill Gates phenomenon in ever more\ndomains. How many visits does an average website get? The answer is: there\nare no average websites. A handful of sites (such as the \nNew York Times\n,\nFacebook or Google) garner the majority of visits, and countless other pages\ndraw comparatively few. In such cases, mathematicians speak of the so-called\npower law. Take cities. There is one city on this planet with a population of more\nthan 30 million: Tokyo. There are 11 cities with a population of between 20 and\n30 million. There are 15 cities with a population of between 10 and 20 million.\nThere are 48 cities with between 5 and 10 million inhabitants. And thousands (!)\nbetween 1 and 5 million. That’s a power law. A few extremes dominate the\ndistribution, and the concept of average is rendered worthless.\nWhat is the average size of a company? What is the average population of a\ncity? What is an average war (in terms of deaths or duration)? What is the\naverage daily ﬂuctuation in the Dow Jones? What is the average cost overrun of\nconstruction projects? How many copies does an average book sell? What is the\naverage amount of damage a hurricane wreaks? What is a banker’s average\nbonus? What is the average success of a marketing campaign? How many\ndownloads does an average iPhone app get? How much money does an\naverage actor earn? Of course you can calculate the answers, but it would be a\nwaste of time. These seemingly routine scenarios are subject to the power law.\nTo use just the ﬁnal example: a handful of actors take home more than $10\nmillion per year, while thousands and thousands live on the breadline. Would you\nadvise your son or daughter to get into acting since the average wage is pretty\ndecent? Hopefully not – wrong reason.\nIn conclusion: if someone uses the word ‘average’, think twice. Try to work out\nthe underlying distribution. If a single anomaly has almost no inﬂuence on the set,\nthe concept is still worthwhile. However, when extreme cases dominate (such as\nthe Bill Gates phenomenon), we should discount the term ‘average’. We should\nall take stock from novelist William Gibson: ‘The future is already here – it’s just\nnot very evenly distributed.’\nSee also \nBase-Rate Neglect\n (ch. 28);\n Simple Logic\n (ch. 63); \nRegression to Mean\n (ch. 19);\nNeglect of Probability\n (ch. 26); \nGambler’s Fallacy\n (ch. 29)\n56\nHOW BONUSES DESTROY MOTIVATION\nMotivation Crowding\nA few months ago, a friend from Connecticut decided to move to New York City.\nThis man had a fabulous collection of antiques, such as exquisite old books and\nhand-blown Murano glasses from generations ago. I knew how attached he was\nto them, and how anxious he would be handing them over to a moving company,\nso the last time I visited, I offered to carry the most fragile items with me when I\nreturned to the city. Two weeks later I got a thank-you letter. Enclosed was a ﬁfty-\ndollar bill.\nFor years, Switzerland has been considering where to store its radioactive\nwaste. The authorities considered a few different locations for the underground\nrepository, including the village of Wolfenschiessen in the centre of the country.\nEconomist Bruno Frey and his fellow researchers at the University of Zurich\ntravelled there and recorded people’s opinions at a community meeting.\nSurprisingly, 50.8% were in favour of the proposal. Their positive response can\nbe attributed to several factors: national pride, common decency, social\nobligation, the prospect of new jobs and so on. The team carried out the survey a\nsecond time, but this time they mentioned a hypothetical reward of $5,000 for\neach townsperson, paid for by Swiss taxpayers, if they were to accept the\nproposal. What happened? Results plummeted: only 24.6% were willing to\nendorse the proposal.\nAnother example is children’s daycare centres. Daycare workers face the same\nissue the world over: parents collecting their children after closing time. The staff\nhave no choice but to wait. They can hardly put the last remaining children in\ntaxis or leave them on the kerb. To discourage parental tardiness, many nurseries\nhave introduced fees for lateness, but studies show that tardiness has actually\nincreased. Of course, they could have instituted a draconian penalty of, say, $500\nfor each hour – as they could have offered $1 million to each citizen of the small\nSwiss village. But that’s beside the point. The point is: small – surprisingly small\n– monetary incentives crowd out other types of incentives.\nThe three stories illustrate one thing: money does not always motivate. Indeed,\nin many cases, it does just the opposite. When my friend slipped me that ﬁfty, he\nundermined my good deed – and also tainted our friendship. The offer of\ncompensation for the nuclear repository was perceived as a bribe, and\ncheapened the community and patriotic spirit. The nursery’s introduction of late\nfees transformed its relationship with parents from interpersonal to monetary, and\nessentially legitimised their lateness.\nScience has a name for this phenomenon: \nmotivation crowding\n. When people\ndo something for well-meaning, non-monetary reasons – out of the goodness of\ntheir hearts, so to speak – payments throw a wrench into the works. Financial\nreward erodes any other motivations.\nSuppose you run a non-proﬁt organisation. Logically, the wages you pay are\nquite modest. Nevertheless, your employees are highly motivated because they\nbelieve they are making a difference. If you suddenly introduce a bonus system –\nlet’s say a small salary increase for every donation secured – \nmotivation\ncrowding\n will commence. Your team will begin to snub tasks that bring no extra\nreward. Creativity, company reputation, knowledge transfer – none of this will\nmatter any more. Soon, all efforts will zoom in on attracting donations.\nSo who is safe from \nmotivation crowding\n? This tip should help: do you know\nany private bankers, insurance agents or ﬁnancial auditors who do their jobs out\nof passion or who believe in a higher mission? I don’t. Financial incentives and\nperformance bonuses work well in industries with generally uninspiring jobs –\nindustries where employees aren’t proud of the products or the companies and do\nthe work simply because they get a pay cheque. On the other hand, if you create\na start-up, you would be wise to enlist employee enthusiasm to promote the\ncompany’s endeavour rather than try to entice employees with juicy bonuses,\nwhich you couldn’t pay anyway.\nOne ﬁnal tip for those of you who have children: experience shows that young\npeople are not for sale. If you want your kids to do their homework, practise\nmusical instruments, or even mow the lawn once in a while, do not reach for your\nwallet. Instead, give them a ﬁxed amount of pocket money each week. Otherwise,\nthey will exploit the system and soon refuse to go to bed without recompense.\nSee also \nIncentive Super-response Tedency\n (ch. 18);\n Reciprocity\n (ch. 6); \nSocial Loafing\n(ch. 33)\n57\nIF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY, SAY NOTHING\nTwaddle Tendency\nWhen asked why a ﬁfth of Americans were unable to locate their country on a\nworld map, Miss Teen South Carolina, a high-school graduate, gave this answer\nin front of rolling cameras: ‘I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to\ndo so because some people out there in our nation don’t have maps, and I\nbelieve that our education like such as South Africa and the Iraq everywhere like\nsuch as and I believe that they should our education over here in the U.S. should\nhelp the U.S., should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian\ncountries, so we will be able to build up our future.’ The video went viral.\nCatastrophic, you agree, but you don’t waste too much time listening to beauty\nqueens. OK, how about the following sentence? ‘There\nis certainly no necessity\nthat this increasingly reﬂexive transmission of cultural traditions be associated\nwith subject-centred reason and future-oriented historical consciousness. To the\nextent that we become aware of the intersubjective constitution of freedom, the\npossessive-individualist illusion of autonomy as self-ownership disintegrates.’\nRing any bells? Top German philosopher and sociologist Jürgen Habermas in\nBetween\n \nFacts and Norms\n.\nBoth of these are manifestations of the same phenomenon, the \ntwaddle\ntendency.\n Here, reams of words are used to disguise intellectual laziness,\nstupidity, or underdeveloped ideas. Sometimes it works, sometimes not. For the\nbeauty queen, the smokescreen strategy failed spectacularly. For Habermas, it\nmight be working. The more eloquent the haze of words, the more easily we fall\nfor them. If used in conjunction with the \nauthority bias\n it can be especially\ndangerous as we are willing to accept the words without questioning them.\nI myself have fallen for the \ntwaddle tendency\n on many occasions. When I was\nyounger, French philosopher Jacques Derrida fascinated me. I devoured his\nbooks, but even after intense reﬂection I still couldn’t understand much.\nSubsequently his writings took on a mysterious aura, and the whole experience\ndrove me to write my dissertation on philosophy. In retrospect, both were tomes of\nuseless chatter – Derrida and my dissertation. In my ignorance, I had turned\nmyself into a walking, talking smoke machine.\nThe \ntwaddle tendency\n is especially rife in sport. Breathless interviewers push\nequally breathless football players to break down the components of the game,\nwhen all they want to say is: ‘We lost the game – it’s really that simple.’ But the\npresenter has to ﬁll airtime somehow – and seemingly the best method is by\njabbering away and by compelling the athletes and coaches to join in. Jabber\ndisguises ignorance.\nThis phenomenon has also taken root in the academic spheres. The fewer\nresults a branch of science publishes, the more babble is necessary. Particularly\nexposed are economists, which can be seen in their comments and economic\nforecasts. The same is true for commerce on a smaller scale: the worse-off a\ncompany is, the greater the talk of the CEO. The extra chatter extends to not just a\nlot of talking, but to hyperactivity, also designed to mask the hardship. A laudable\nexception is the former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch. He once said in an\ninterview: ‘You would not believe how difﬁcult it is to be simple and clear. People\nare afraid that they may be seen as a simpleton. In reality, just the opposite is\ntrue.’\nIn conclusion: verbal expression is the mirror of the mind. Clear thoughts\nbecome clear statements, whereas ambiguous ideas transform into vacant\nramblings. The trouble is that, in many cases, we lack very lucid thoughts. The\nworld is complicated, and it takes a great deal of mental effort to understand even\none facet of the whole. Until you experience such an epiphany, it’s better to heed\nMark Twain: ‘If\nyou have nothing to say, say nothing.’ Simplicity is the zenith of a\nlong, arduous journey, not the starting point.\nSee also \nAuthority Bias\n (ch.9);\n Domain Dependence\n (ch. 76); \nChauffeur Knowledge\n (ch.\n16)\n58\nHOW TO INCREASE THE AVERAGE IQ OF TWO STATES\nWill Rogers Phenomenon\nLet’s\nsay you run a small private bank. The bank manages the money of wealthy\nand mostly retired individuals. Two money managers – A and B – report to you.\nMoney Manager A manages the money of a few ultra-high-net-worth individuals.\nMoney Manager B has rich, but not extravagantly rich, clients to deal with. The\nboard asks you to increase the average pool of money of both A and B – within\nsix months. If you succeed, you receive a handsome bonus. If not, they’ll ﬁnd\nsomeone else to do it. Where do you start?\nIt’s quite simple, actually: you take a client with a sizeable but not a huge pool\nof money from A and give it to B instead. In one fell swoop, this brings up A’s\naverage managed wealth as well as B’s without you having to ﬁnd a single new\nclient. The only remaining question is: how will you spend your bonus?\nSuppose you switch careers, and are now in charge of three hedge funds that\ninvest primarily in privately held companies. Fund A has sensational returns, fund\nB’s are mediocre and fund C’s are miserable. You want to prove yourself to the\nworld, so what’s your master plan? You know how it works now: you move a few\nof A’s shares to B and C, picking exactly those investments that have been\npulling down A’s average returns, but which are still proﬁtable enough to fortify B\nand C. In no time, all three funds look much healthier. And, because the\ntransformation happened in-house, you don’t incur a single fee. Of course, the\ncombined value of the trio hasn’t risen by a single cent, but people will still pat\nyou on the back.\nThis effect is called \nstage migration\n or the \nWill Rogers phenomenon\n, after an\nAmerican comedian from Oklahoma. He is said to have joked that Oklahomans\nwho pack up and move to California raise both states’ average IQ. Since we\nrarely recognise such scenarios, let’s drill the \nWill Rogers phenomenon\n to anchor\nit in your memory.\nOne good example is an auto franchise: let’s say you take charge of two small\nbranches in the same town with a total of six salesmen: numbers 1, 2 and 3 in\nbranch A, and numbers 4, 5 and 6 in branch B. On average, salesman number 1\nsells one car per week, salesman number 2 sells two cars per week and so on up\nto top salesman number 6, who shifts six cars each week. With a little calculation,\nyou know that branch A sells two cars per salesman, whereas branch B is far\nahead with an average of ﬁve cars per salesman per week. You decide to transfer\nsalesman number 4 to branch A. What happens? Its average sales increase to\n2.5 units per person. And branch B? It now consists of only two salesmen,\nnumbers 5 and 6. Its average sales increase to 5.5 per person. Such switcheroo\nstrategies don’t change anything overall, but they create an impressive illusion.\nFor this reason, journalists, investors and board members should be on special\nalert when they hear of rising averages in countries, companies, departments,\ncost centres or product lines.\nA particularly deceitful case of the \nWill Rogers phenomenon\n is found in\nmedicine. Tumours are usually broken down into four stages: the smallest and\nmost treatable ones are classiﬁed as stage one; the worst are rated stage four.\nTheir progression gives us the term \nstage migration\n. The survival rate is highest\nfor stage-one patients and lowest for stage-four patients. Now, every year new\nprocedures are released on to the market and allow for more accurate diagnosis.\nThese new screening techniques reveal minuscule tumours that no doctor had\never noticed before. The result: patients who were erroneously diagnosed as\nhealthy before are now counted as stage-one patients. The addition of relatively\nhealthy people into the stage-one group increases the group’s average life\nexpectancy. A great medical success? Unfortunately not: mere \nstage migration\n.\nSee also \nIntention-to-Treat Error\n (ch. 98);\n The Law of Small Numbers\n (ch. 61)\n59\nIF YOU HAVE AN ENEMY, GIVE HIM INFORMATION\nInformation Bias\nIn his short story ‘Del rigor en la ciencia’, which consists of just a single\nparagraph, Jorge Luis Borges describes a special country. In this country, the\nscience of cartography is so sophisticated that only the most detailed of maps will\ndo – that is, a map with a scale of 1:1, as large as the country itself. Its citizens\nsoon realise that such a map does not provide any insight, since it merely\nduplicates what they already know. Borges’ map is an extreme case of the\ninformation bias\n, the delusion that more information guarantees better decisions.\nSearching for a hotel in Miami a little while ago, I drew up a shortlist of ﬁve\ngood offers. Straight away, one jumped out at me, but I wanted to make sure I had\nfound the best deal and decided to keep researching. I ploughed my way through\ndozens of customer reviews and blog posts and clicked through countless photos\nand videos. Two hours later, I could say for sure which the best hotel was: the\none I had liked at the start. The mountain of additional information did not lead to\na better decision. On the contrary, if time is money, then I might as well have\ntaken up residence at the Four Seasons.\nJonathan Baron from the University of Pennsylvania asked physicians the\nfollowing question: a patient presents symptoms that indicate with a probability of\n80% that he is suffering from disease A. If this is not the case, the patient has\neither disease X or Y. Each of these diseases is equally bad, and each treatment\nresults in similar side effects. As a doctor, what treatment would you suggest?\nLogically, you would opt for disease A and recommend the relevant therapy. Now\nsuppose there is a diagnostic test that ﬂashes ‘positive’ when disease X is\npresent, and ‘negative’ when disease Y is detected. However, if the patient really\ndoes have disease A, the test results will be positive in 50% of the cases, and\nnegative in the other 50%. Would you recommend conducting the test? Most\ndoctors said yes – even though the results would be irrelevant. Assuming that the\ntest result is positive, the probability of disease A is still much greater than that of\ndisease X. The additional information contributes nothing of value to the decision.\nDoctors are not the only professionals with a penchant for surplus information.\nManagers and investors are almost addicted to it. How often are studies\ncommissioned one after the other, even though the critical facts are readily\navailable? Additional information not only wastes time and money, it can also put\nyou at a disadvantage. Consider this question: which city has more inhabitants –\nSan Diego or San Antonio? Gerd Gigerenzer of the Max Planck Institute in\nGermany put this question to students in the Universities of Chicago and Munich.\nSixty-two per cent of Chicago students guessed right: San Diego has more. But,\nastonishingly, every single German student answered correctly. The reason: all of\nthem had heard of San Diego, but not necessarily of San Antonio, so they opted\nfor the more familiar city. For the Chicagoans, however, both cities were\nhousehold names. They had more information and it misled them.\nOr, consider the hundreds of thousands of economists – in the service of banks,\nthink tanks, hedge funds and governments – and all the white papers they have\npublished from 2005 to 2007, the vast library of research reports and\nmathematical models. The formidable reams of comments. The polished\nPowerPoint presentations. The terabytes of information on Bloomberg and\nReuters news services. The bacchanal dance to worship the god of information. It\nwas all hot air. The ﬁnancial crisis touched down and upended global markets,\nrendering the countless forecasts and comments worthless.\nForget trying to amass all the data. Do your best to get by with the bare facts. It\nwill help you make better decisions. Superﬂuous knowledge is worthless,\nwhether you know it or not. Daniel J. Boorstin put it right: ‘The greatest obstacle to\ndiscovery is not ignorance – it is the illusion of knowledge.’ And next time you are\nconfronted by a rival, consider killing him – not with kindness but with reams of\ndata and analysis.\nSee also \nOverthinking\n (ch. 90);\n News Illusion\n (ch. 99); \nBase-Rate Neglect\n (ch. 28)\n60\nHURTS SO GOOD\nEffort Justification\nJohn, a soldier in the U.S. Army, has just completed his paratrooper course. He\nwaits patiently in line to receive the coveted parachute pin. At last, his superior\nofﬁcer stands in front of him, lines the pin up against his chest and pounds it in so\nhard that it pierces John’s ﬂesh. Ever since, he opens his top shirt button at every\nopportunity to showcase the small scar. Decades later, he has thrown away all\nthe memorabilia from his time in the army, except for the tiny pin, which hangs in\na specially made frame on his living room wall.\nMark singlehandedly restored a rusty Harley-Davidson. Every weekend and\nholiday went into getting it up and running; all the while his marriage was\napproaching breakdown. It was a struggle, but ﬁnally Mark’s prized possession\nwas road-ready and gleamed in the sunshine. Two years later, Mark desperately\nneeds money. He sells all his possessions – the TV, the car, even his house –\nbut not the bike. Even when a prospect offers double the actual value, Mark does\nnot sell it.\nJohn and Mark are victims of \neffort justiﬁcation\n. When you put a lot of energy\ninto a task, you tend to overvalue the result. Because John had to endure\nphysical pain for the parachute pin, it outshines all his other awards. And since\nMark’s Harley cost him so many hours – and also nearly his wife – he prizes the\nbike so highly that he will never sell it.\nEffort justiﬁcation \nis a special case of \ncognitive dissonance\n. To have a hole\npunched in your chest for a simple merit badge borders on the absurd. John’s\nbrain compensates for this imbalance by overvaluing the pin, hyping it up from\nsomething mundane to something semi-sacred. All of this happens\nunconsciously and is difficult to prevent.\nGroups use \neffort justiﬁcation\n to bind members to them – for example, through\ninitiation rites. Gangs and fraternities initiate new members by forcing them to\nwithstand nauseating or vicious tests. Research proves that the harder the\n‘entrance exam’ is to pass, the greater the subsequent pride and the value they\nattach to their membership. MBA schools play with \neffort justiﬁcation\n in this way:\nthey work their students day and night without respite, often to the point of\nexhaustion. Regardless of how useful or idiotic the coursework, once the students\nhave the MBAs in the bag, they’ll deem the qualiﬁcation essential for their careers\nsimply because it demanded so much of them.\nA mild form of \neffort justiﬁcation\n is the so-called \nIKEA effect\n. Furniture that we\nassemble ourselves seems more valuable than any expensive designer piece.\nThe same goes for hand-knitted socks. To throw away a hand-crafted pair, even if\nthey are tatty and outdated, is hard to do. Managers who put weeks of hard work\ninto a strategy proposal will be incapable of appraising it objectively. Designers,\ncopywriters, product developers, or any other professionals who brood over their\ncreations are similarly guilty of this.\nIn the 1950s, instant cake mixes were introduced to the market. A sureﬁre hit,\nthought the manufacturers. Far from it: housewives took an instant dislike to them\n– because they made things too easy. The ﬁrms reacted and made the\npreparation slightly more difﬁcult (beating in an egg yourself). The added effort\nraised the women’s sense of achievement and, with it, their appreciation for\nconvenience food.\nNow that you know about \neffort justiﬁcation\n, you can rate your projects more\nobjectively. Try it out: whenever you have invested a lot of time and effort into\nsomething, stand back and examine the result – \nonly \nthe result. The novel you’ve\nbeen tinkering with for ﬁve years and that no publisher wants: perhaps it’s not\nNobel-worthy after all. The MBA you felt compelled to do: would you really\nrecommend it? And the woman you’ve been chasing for years: is she really better\nthan bachelorette number two, who would say yes straight away?\nSee also \nSunk Cost Fallacy\n (ch. 5);\n Cognitive Dissonance\n (ch. 50)\n61\nWHY SMALL THINGS LOOM LARGE\nThe Law of Small Numbers\nYou sit on the corporate board of a retail company with 1,000 stores. Half of the\nstores are in cities, the other half in rural areas. At the behest of the CEO, a\nconsultant conducted a study on shoplifting and is now presenting his ﬁndings.\nProjected on to the wall in front are the names of the 100 branches that have the\nhighest theft rates compared to sales. In bold letters above them is his eye-\nopening conclusion: ‘The branches with the highest theft rate are primarily in rural\nareas.’ After a moment of silence and disbelief, the CEO is ﬁrst to speak: ‘Ladies\nand gentlemen, the next steps are clear. From now on, we will install additional\nsafety systems in all rural branches. Let’s see those hillbillies steal from us then!\nDo we all agree?’\nHmmm, not completely. You ask the consultant to call up the 100 branches with\nthe lowest theft rates. After some swift sorting, the list appears. Surprise, surprise:\nthe shops with the lowest amount of shoplifting in relation to sales are also in\nrural areas! ‘The location isn’t the deciding factor,’ you begin, smiling somewhat\nsmugly as you gaze around the table at your colleagues. ‘What counts is the size\nof the store. In the countryside, the branches tend to be small, meaning a single\nincident has a much larger inﬂuence on the theft rate. Therefore, the rural\nbranches’ rates vary greatly – much more than the larger city branches. Ladies\nand gentlemen, I introduce you to the \nlaw of small numbers\n. It has just caught you\nout.’\nThe \nlaw of small numbers\n is not something we understand intuitively. Thus\npeople – especially journalists, managers and board members – continually fall\nfor it. Let’s examine an extreme example. Instead of the theft rate, consider the\naverage weight of employees in a branch. Instead of 1,000 stores, we’ll take just\ntwo: a mega-branch and a mini-branch. The big store has 1,000 employees; the\nsmall store just two. The average weight in the large branch corresponds roughly\nto the average weight of the population, say 170 pounds. Regardless of who is\nhired or ﬁred, it will not change much. Unlike the small store: in these cases, the\nstore manager’s colleague, if rotund or reedy, will affect the average weight\ntremendously.\nLet’s go back to the shoplifting problem. We now understand why the smaller a\nbranch is, the more its theft rate will vary – from extremely high to extremely low.\nNo matter how the consultant arranges his spreadsheet, if you list all the theft\nrates in order of size, small stores will appear at the bottom, large stores will take\nup the middle – and the top slots? Small stores again. So, the CEO’s conclusion\nwas useless, but at least he doesn’t need to go overboard on a security system\nfor the small stores.\nSuppose you read the following story in the newspaper: ‘Start-ups employ\nsmarter people. A study commissioned by the National Institute of Unnecessary\nResearch has calculated the average IQ in American companies. The result:\nStart-ups hire MENSA material.’ What is your ﬁrst reaction? Hopefully a raised\neyebrow. This is a perfect example of the \nlaw of small numbers\n. Start-ups tend to\nemploy fewer people; therefore the average IQs will ﬂuctuate much more than\nthose of large corporations, giving small (and new) businesses the highest and\nlowest scores. The National Institute’s study has zero signiﬁcance. It simply\nconfirms the laws of chance.\nSo, watch out when you hear remarkable statistics about any small entities:\nbusinesses, households, cities, data centres, anthills, parishes, schools etc. What\nis being peddled as an astounding ﬁnding is, in fact, a humdrum consequence of\nrandom distribution. In his latest book, Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman\nreveals that even experienced scientists succumb to the \nlaw of small numbers.\nHow reassuring.\nSee also \nExponential Growth\n (ch. 34);\n Will Rogers Phenomenon\n (ch. 58)\n62\nHANDLE WITH CARE\nExpectations\nOn 31 January 2006, Google announced its ﬁnancial results for the ﬁnal quarter\nof 2005. Revenue: up 97%. Net proﬁt: up 82%. A record-breaking quarter. How\ndid the stock market react to these phenomenal ﬁgures? In a matter of seconds,\nshares tumbled 16%. Trading had to be interrupted. When it resumed, the stock\nplunged another 15%. Absolute panic. One particularly desperate trader inquired\non his blog: ‘What’s the best skyscraper to throw myself off?’\nWhat had gone wrong? Wall Street analysts had anticipated even better\nresults, and when those failed to materialise, $20 billion was slashed from the\nvalue of the media giant.\nEvery investor knows it’s impossible to forecast ﬁnancial results accurately.\nThe logical response to a poor prediction would be: ‘A bad guess, my mistake.’\nBut investors don’t react that way. In January 2006, when Juniper Networks\nannounced eagerly anticipated earnings per share that were a \ntenth\n of a cent\nlower than analysts’ forecasts, the share price fell 21% and the company’s value\nplunged $2.5 billion. When expectations are fuelled in the run-up to an\nannouncement, any disparity gives rise to draconian punishment, regardless of\nhow paltry the gap is.\nMany companies bend over backwards to meet analysts’ predictions. To\nescape this terror, some began publishing their own estimates, so-called\n‘earnings guidance’. Not a smart move. Now, the market heeds only these\ninternal forecasts – and studies them much more closely to boot. CFOs are forced\nto achieve these targets to the cent, and so must draw on all the accounting\nartifices available.\nFortunately, expectations can also lead to commendable incentives. In 1965,\nthe American psychologist Robert Rosenthal conducted a noteworthy experiment\nin various schools. Teachers were told of a (fake) new test that could identify\nstudents who were on the verge of an intellectual spurt – so-called ‘bloomers’.\nTwenty per cent of students were randomly selected and classiﬁed as such.\nTeachers remained under the impression that these were indeed high-potential\nstudents. After a year, Rosenthal discovered that these students had developed\nmuch higher IQs than other children in a control group. This effect became known\nas the \nRosenthal effect\n (or \nPygmalion effect\n).\nUnlike the CEOs and CFOs who consciously tailor their performance to meet\nexpectations, the teachers’ actions were subconscious. Unknowingly, they\nprobably devoted more time to the bloomers, and consequently, the group\nlearned more. The prospect of brilliant students inﬂuenced the teachers so much\nthat they ascribed not just better grades but also improved personality traits to the\n‘gifted’ students – a tribute to the \nhalo\n \neffect\n.\nBut how do we react to personal expectations? This brings us to the \nplacebo\neffect – \npills and therapies that are unlikely to improve health, but do so anyway.\nThe \nplacebo effect\n has been registered in one-third of all patients. But how it\nworks is not well understood. All we know is that expectations alter the\nbiochemistry of the brain and thus the whole body. Accordingly Alzheimer’s\npatients cannot beneﬁt from it: their condition impairs the area of the brain that\ndeals with expectations.\nExpectations are intangible, but their effect is quite real. They have the power\nto change reality. Can we deprogramme them? Is it possible to live a life free from\nexpectations? Unfortunately not. But you can deal with them more cautiously.\nRaise expectations for yourself and for the people you love. This increases\nmotivation. At the same time, lower expectations for things you cannot control –\nfor example, the stock market. As paradoxical as it sounds, the best way to shield\nyourself from nasty surprises is to anticipate them.\nSee also \nBlack Swan\n (ch. 75);\n Forecast Illusion\n (ch. 40); \nHalo Effect\n (ch. 38)\n63\nSPEED TRAPS AHEAD!\nSimple Logic\nThree easy questions. Grab a pen quickly and jot down your answers in the\nmargin. First question: in a department store, a ping-pong paddle and a plastic\nball cost $1.10. If the paddle costs $1 more, how much is the ball? Second\nquestion: in a textile factory, ﬁve machines take exactly ﬁve minutes to make ﬁve\nshirts. How many minutes will it take 100 machines to produce 100 shirts? And,\nthe third question: a pond has water lilies growing in it. The ﬂowers multiply\nquickly, each day doubling the area they take up. If it takes 48 days for the pond\nto be completely covered with water lilies, how many days will it take for it to be\nhalf covered? Don’t read on until you have written down the answers.\nFor each of these questions, there is an intuitive answer – and a right one. The\nquick, intuitive answers come to mind ﬁrst: 10 cents, 100 minutes and 24 days.\nBut these are all wrong. The solutions are: ﬁve cents, ﬁve minutes and 47 days.\nHow many did you answer correctly?\nThousands of people have taken this ‘Cognitive Reﬂection Test’ (CRT), which\nwas developed by professor Shane Frederick. So far, students at the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston have fared best. On\naverage, they got 2.18 correct answers. Students at Princeton University came in\nsecond with an average of 1.63. Far below were students of the University of\nMichigan, who scored an average of 0.83. However, despite these neat rankings,\naverages in this case are not interesting. More interesting is how those who\nscored highly differ from the rest.\nHere’s a hint: would you prefer a bird in the hand or two in the bush? Frederick\ndiscovered that people with low CRT results tend to prefer a bird in the hand.\nThey play it safe. After all, \nsomething\n is better than nothing. Those who score at\nleast 2 or higher usually opt for the riskier option. They prefer the gamble. This is\nespecially true for men.\nOne factor that separates the groups is their ability to control their impulses. In\nthe chapter on \nhyperbolic discounting\n, we covered the seductive power of ‘now’.\nFrederick put the following question to the participants: ‘Would you rather have\n$3,400 now or $3,800 in a month?’ In general, people with low CRT scores\nfavour getting the smaller amount sooner. For them, waiting poses a challenge\nbecause they are more impulsive. This also applies to purchasing decisions. In\ncontrast, people with high CRT results usually decide to wait the extra few weeks.\nThey muster the willpower to turn down instant gratiﬁcation – and are rewarded\nfor it later on.\nThinking is more exhausting than sensing: rational consideration requires more\nwillpower than simply giving in to intuition. In other words, intuitive people tend to\nscrutinise less. This led Harvard psychologist Amitai Shenhav and his research\ncolleagues to investigate whether people’s CRT results correlate with their faith.\nAmericans with a high CRT score (the study was conducted only in the U.S.) are\noften atheists, and their convictions have been reinforced over the years.\nParticipants with low CRT results, however, tend to believe in God and ‘the\nimmortality of the soul’, and have often had divine experiences. This makes\nsense: the more intuitively people make decisions, the less rationally they query\nreligious beliefs.\nIf you are less than pleased with your CRT score and want to improve it, start\nby greeting even the simplest logical questions with incredulity. Not everything\nthat seems plausible is true. Reject the easy answers that pop into your head. So,\none more try: you are travelling from A to B. On the way there, you drive at 100\nmph and on the way back, at 50 mph. What was your average speed? 75?

This is how I would\nsum you up: ‘You have a great need for other people to like and admire you. You\nhave a tendency to be critical of yourself. You have a great deal of unused\ncapacity, which you have not turned to your advantage. While you have some\npersonality weaknesses, you are generally able to compensate for them. Your\nsexual adjustment has presented problems for you. Disciplined and self-\ncontrolled outside, you tend to be worrisome and insecure inside. At times you\nhave serious doubts as to whether you have made the right decision or done the\nright thing. You prefer a certain amount of change and variety and become\ndissatisﬁed when hemmed in by restrictions and limitations. You pride yourself as\nan independent thinker and do not accept others’ statements without satisfactory\nproof. You have found it unwise to be too frank in revealing yourself to others. At\ntimes you are extroverted, affable and sociable while at other times you are\nintroverted, wary and reserved. Some of your aspirations tend to be pretty\nunrealistic. Security is one of your major goals in life.’\nDo you recognise yourself? On a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent), how was\nmy assessment?\nIn 1948, psychologist Bertram Forer crafted this exact passage using astrology\ncolumns from various magazines. He then gave it to his students to read,\nsuggesting that each person was getting a personalised assessment. On\naverage, the students rated their characterisations 4.3 out of ﬁve, i.e. they gave\nForer an accuracy score of 86%. The experiment was repeated hundreds of times\nin the decades that followed, with virtually identical results.\nMost likely you gave the text a 4 or 5, too. People tend to identify many of their\nown traits in such universal descriptions. Science labels this tendency the \nForer\neffect\n (or the \nBarnum effect\n). The \nForer effect\n explains why the pseudo-sciences\nwork so well – astrology, astrotherapy, the study of handwriting, biorhythm\nanalysis, palmistry, tarot-card readings and séances with the dead.\nWhat’s behind the \nForer effect\n? First, the majority of statements in Forer’s\npassage are so general that they relate to everyone: ‘Sometimes you seriously\ndoubt your actions.’ Who doesn’t? Second, we tend to accept ﬂattering\nstatements that don’t apply to us: ‘You are proud of your independent thinking.’\nObviously! Who sees himself or herself as a mindless follower? Third, the so-\ncalled \nfeature positive effect\n plays a part: the text contains no negative\nstatements; it states only what we are, even though the absence of characteristics\nis an equally important part of a person’s make-up. Fourth, the father of all the\nfallacies, the \nconﬁrmation bias\n: we accept whatever corresponds to our self-\nimage and unconsciously ﬁlter everything else out. What remains is a coherent\nportrait.\nWhatever tricks astrologers and palm readers can turn, consultants and\nanalysts can too: ‘The stock has signiﬁcant growth potential, even in a very\ncompetitive environment. The company lacks the necessary impetus to fully\nrealise and implement ideas from the development team. Management is made\nup of experienced industry professionals; however, hints of bureaucratisation are\nnoticeable. A look at the proﬁt and loss statement clearly shows that savings can\nbe made. We advise the company to focus even more closely on emerging\neconomies to secure future market share.’ Sounds about right, no?\nHow do you rate the quality of such a guru – for example, an astrologer? Pick\ntwenty people and secretly assign each a number. Have him characterise the\npeople and write his assessments down on cards. To ensure anonymity,\nparticipants never ﬁnd out their numbers. Afterward, each receives a copy of all\nthe cards. Only when the majority of people identify ‘their’ description is there real\ntalent at hand. I am still waiting.\nSee also \nFeature-Positive Effect\n (ch. 95);\n Confirmation Bias \n(chs. 7–8)\n;\n Self-Serving Bias\n(ch. 45)\n65\nVOLUNTEER WORK IS FOR THE BIRDS\nVolunteer’s Folly\nJack, a photographer, is on the go from Monday to Friday. Commissioned by\nfashion magazines, he divides his time between Milan, Paris and New York and\nis constantly in search of the most beautiful girls, the most original designs and\nthe perfect light. He is well known on the social circuit, and the money is great:\n$500 an hour, easy. ‘That’s as much as a commercial lawyer,’ he brags to his\nbuddies, ‘and what I have in front of my lens looks a lot better than any banker.’\nJack leads an enviable life, but lately he has become more philosophical. It\nfeels as if something has come between him and the fashion world. The\nselﬁshness of the industry suddenly repels him. Sometimes he lies in bed, staring\nat the ceiling, and yearns for more meaningful work. He would like to be selﬂess\nonce again, to contribute something to the world, no matter how small.\nOne day his phone rings. It’s Patrick, his former classmate and current\npresident of the local bird club: ‘Next Saturday we’re having our annual birdhouse\ndrive. We’re looking for volunteers to help us build birdhouses for endangered\nspecies. Afterwards we’ll put them up in the woods. Do you have time? We’re\nmeeting at 8 o’clock in the morning. We should be done shortly after noon.’\nWhat should Jack say if he really is serious about creating a better world?\nThat’s right, he should turn down the request. Why? Jack earns $500 an hour. A\ncarpenter, $50. It would be much more sensible to work an extra hour as a\nphotographer and then hire a professional carpenter for six hours to make good\nquality birdhouses (which Jack could never hope to accomplish). Taxes aside, he\ncould donate the difference ($200) to the bird club. Doing so, his contribution\nwould go much farther than if he grabbed a saw and rolled up his sleeves.\nNevertheless, it is highly likely that Jack will turn up bright and early next\nSaturday to build birdhouses. Economists call this \nvolunteer’s folly\n. It is a popular\nphenomenon: more than one-fourth of Americans volunteer their time. But what\nmakes it folly? Among other things, if Jack chooses to cobble together a few\nbirdhouses himself, it takes away work from a tradesman. Working a little longer\nand donating a portion of the earnings is the most effective contribution Jack can\nmake. Hands-on volunteer work would be helpful only if he could make use of his\nexpertise. If the bird club were planning a fundraising mail campaign and needed\na professional photo, Jack could either shoot it himself or work an hour longer to\nhire another top photographer and donate the remainder.\nSo now we come to the thorny topic of altruism. Does selflessness exist at all or\nis it merely a balm to our egos? Although a desire to help the community\nmotivates many volunteers, personal beneﬁts such as gaining skills, experience,\nand contacts also play a big part. Suddenly we’re not acting quite so selﬂessly.\nIndeed, many volunteers engage in what might be deemed ‘personal happiness\nmanagement’, the beneﬁts of which are sometimes far removed from the real\ncause. Strictly speaking, anyone who proﬁts or feels even the slightest\nsatisfaction from volunteering is not a pure altruist.\nSo does it mean Jack is a fool if he turns up, hammer in hand, on Saturday\nmorning? Not necessarily. There is one group exempt from \nvolunteer’s folly\n:\ncelebrities. If Bono, Kate Winslet or Mark Zuckerberg pose for photos while\nmaking birdhouses, cleaning oil-stained beaches or digging for earthquake\nvictims, they lend something priceless to the situation: publicity. Therefore, Jack\nmust critically assess whether he is famous enough to make his participation\nworthwhile. The same applies to you and me: if people don’t double-take when\nthey pass you on the street, the best way to contribute is with greenbacks rather\nthan greenhorn labor.\nSee also \nDéformation Professionnelle\n (ch. 92);\n Omission Bias\n (ch. 44)\n66\nWHY YOU ARE A SLAVE TO YOUR EMOTIONS\nAffect Heuristic\nWhat do you think of genetically modiﬁed wheat? It’s a complex issue. You don’t\nwant to answer too hastily. A rational approach would be to consider the\ncontroversial technology’s pros and cons separately. Write down the possible\nbeneﬁts, weight them in terms of importance, and then multiply them by the\nprobability that they will occur. Doing so, you get a list of expected values. Next,\ndo the same with the cons. List all the disadvantages, estimate their potential\ndamage and multiply them by the likelihood of them happening. The positive sum\nminus the negative sum equals the net expected value. If it is above zero, you are\nin favour of genetically modiﬁed wheat. If the sum is below zero, you are against\nit. More than likely you have already heard of this approach. It is called ‘expected\nvalue’, and it features in most literature on decision theory. But just as probable is\nthat you’ve never bothered to carry out such an evaluation. And without a doubt,\nnone of the professors who wrote the textbooks turned to this method to select\ntheir spouses.\nTruth be told, no one uses this method to make decisions. First of all, we lack\nenough imagination to list all the possible pros and cons. We are limited by what\nsprings to mind; we can only conjure up what we have seen in our modest\nexperience. It is hard to imagine a storm of the century if you’re only 30 years old.\nSecond, calculating small probabilities is impossible because we do not have\nenough data on rare events. The smaller the probability, the fewer data points we\nhave and the higher the error rate on the exact probability – a vicious effect. Third,\nour brain is not built for such calculations. They require time and effort – not our\npreferred state. In our evolutionary past, whoever thought too long and hard\nvanished inside a predator’s jaws. We are the descendants of quick decision-\nmakers, and we rely on mental shortcuts called heuristics.\nOne of the most popular is the \naffect heuristic\n. An affect is a momentary\njudgement: something you like or dislike. The word ‘gunﬁre’ triggers a negative\neffect. The word ‘luxury’ produces a positive one. This automatic, one-\ndimensional impulse prevents you from considering risks and beneﬁts to be\nindependent variables, which indeed they are. Instead, the \naffect heuristic\n puts\nrisks and benefits on the same sensory thread.\nYour emotional reactions to issues such as nuclear power, organic vegetables,\nprivate schools or motorbikes determine how you assess their risks and beneﬁts.\nIf you like something, you believe that the risks are smaller and the beneﬁts\ngreater than they actually are. If you don’t like something, the opposite is true.\nRisks and benefits appear to be dependent. Of course, in reality, they are not.\nEven more impressive, suppose you own a Harley-Davidson. If you come\nacross a study that states that driving one is riskier than previously thought, you\nwill subconsciously tweak how you rate the beneﬁts, deeming the experience ‘an\neven greater sense of freedom’.\nBut how does an affect – the initial, spontaneous emotion – come to be?\nResearchers at the University of Michigan ﬂashed either of three images for less\nthan one hundredth of a second in front of participants: a smiling face, an angry\nface or a neutral ﬁgure. The subjects then had to indicate whether they liked a\nrandomly selected Chinese character or not (the participants didn’t speak\nChinese). Most preferred symbols that immediately followed the smiling face.\nSeemingly insigniﬁcant factors inﬂuence our emotions. Here is another example\nwhere an insigniﬁcant factor plays a role. Researchers Hirschleifer and Shumway\ntested the relationship between the amount of morning sun and daily market\nperformance in 26 major stock exchanges between 1982 and 1997. They found a\ncorrelation that reads much like a farmer’s adage: if the sun is shining in the\nmorning, the stock market will rise during the day. Not always, but often. Who\nwould have thought that sunshine could move billions? The morning sun\nobviously has the same effect as a smiley face.\nWhether we like it or not, we are puppets of our emotions. We make complex\ndecisions by consulting our feelings, not our thoughts. Against our best intentions,\nwe substitute the question, ‘What do I think about this?’ with ‘How do I feel about\nthis?’ So, smile! Your future depends on it.\nSee also \nAssociation Bias\n (ch. 48);\n Loss Aversion\n (ch. 32); \nSalience Effect\n (ch. 83);\nContagion Bias\n (ch. 54)\n67\nBE YOUR OWN HERETIC\nIntrospection Illusion\nBruce is in the vitamin business. His father founded the company when\nsupplements were not yet a lifestyle product; a doctor had to prescribe them.\nWhen Bruce took over the operation in the early 1990s, demand skyrocketed.\nBruce seized the opportunity with both hands and took out huge loans to expand\nproduction. Today, he is one of the most successful people in the business and\npresident of a national association of vitamin manufactures. Since childhood,\nhardly a day has passed without him swallowing at least three multivitamins. A\njournalist once asked him if they do anything. He replied: ‘I’m sure of it.’ Do you\nbelieve him?\nI have another question for you. Take any idea you are 100% sure of, perhaps\nthat gold will rise over the next ﬁve years. Perhaps that God exists. Perhaps that\nyour dentist is overcharging you. Whatever the belief, write it down in one\nsentence. Do you believe yourself?\nI bet you consider your conviction more valid than Bruce’s, right? Here’s why:\nyours is an internal observation, whereas Bruce’s is external. Crudely put, you\ncan peek into your own soul, but not into his.\nIn Bruce’s case, you might think: ‘Come on, it’s obviously in his interest to\nbelieve that vitamins are beneﬁcial. After all, his wealth and social status depend\non the success of the company. He has to maintain a family tradition. All his life\nhe has gulped down pills, so he’ll never admit that it was a waste of time.’ For\nyou, however, it’s a different story: you have searched deep inside. You are\ncompletely impartial.\nBut how pure and honest is internal reﬂection? The Swedish psychologist\nPetter Johannson allowed test subjects to glimpse two portrait photos of random\npeople and choose which face was more attractive. Then he showed them the\npreferred photo up close and asked them to describe the most attractive features.\nHowever, with a sleight of hand, he switched the pictures. Most participants failed\nto notice and proceeded to justify, in detail, why they favoured the image. The\nresults of the study: introspection is not reliable. When we soul-search, we\ncontrive the findings.\nThe belief that reﬂection leads to truth or accuracy is called the \nintrospection\nillusion\n. This is more than sophistry. Because we are so conﬁdent of our beliefs,\nwe experience three reactions when someone fails to share our views. Response\n1: Assumption of ignorance. The other party clearly lacks the necessary\ninformation. If he knew what you know, he would be of the same opinion. Political\nactivists think this way: they believe they can win others over through\nenlightenment. Reaction 2: Assumption of idiocy. The other person has the\nnecessary information, but his mind is underdeveloped. He cannot draw the\nobvious conclusions. In other words, he’s a moron. This reaction is particularly\npopular with bureaucrats who want to protect ‘stupid’ consumers from\nthemselves. Response 3: Assumption of malice. Your counterpart has the\nnecessary information – he even understands the debate – but he is deliberately\nconfrontational. He has evil intentions. This is how many religious leaders and\nfollowers treat disbelievers: if they don’t agree, they must be servants of the devil!\nIn conclusion: nothing is more convincing than your own beliefs. We believe\nthat introspection unearths genuine self-knowledge. Unfortunately, introspection\nis, in large part, fabrication posing two dangers: ﬁrst, the \nintrospection illusion\ncreates inaccurate predictions of future mental states. Trust your internal\nobservations too much and too long, and you might be in for a very rude\nawakening. Second, we believe that our introspections are more reliable than\nthose of others, which creates an illusion of superiority. Remedy: be all the more\ncritical with yourself. Regard your internal observations with the same scepticism\nas claims from some random person. Become your own toughest critic.\nSee also \nIllusion of Control\n (ch. 17);\n Self-Serving Bias\n (ch. 45);\n Confirmation Bias\n (ch.\n7–8);\n Not-Invented-Here Syndrome\n (ch. 74)\n68\nWHY YOU SHOULD SET FIRE TO YOUR SHIPS\nInability to Close Doors\nNext to my bed, two dozen books are stacked high. I have dipped in and out of all\nof them, but am unable to part with even one. I know that sporadic reading won’t\nhelp me achieve any real insights, despite the many hours I put in, and that I\nshould really devote myself to one book at a time. So why am I still juggling all\ntwenty-four?\nI know a man who is dating three women. He is in love with all three and can\nimagine starting a family with any of them. However, he simply doesn’t have the\nheart to choose just one, because then he would be passing up on the other two\nfor good. If he refrains from deciding, all options remain open. The downside is\nthat no real relationship will develop.\nIn the third century B.C., General Xiang Yu sent his army across the Yangtze\nRiver to take on the Qin Dynasty. While his troops slept, he ordered all the ships\nto be set alight. The next day he told them: ‘You now have a choice: Either you\nﬁght to win or you die.’ By removing the option of retreat, he switched their focus\nto the only thing that mattered: the battle. Spanish conquistador Cortés used the\nsame motivational trick in the sixteenth century. After landing on the east coast of\nMexico, he sank his own ship.\nXiang Yu and Cortés are exceptions. We mere mortals do everything we can to\nkeep open the maximum number of options. Psychology professors Dan Ariely\nand Jiwoong Shin demonstrated the strength of this instinct using a computer\ngame. Players started with 100 points, and on the screen in front of them, three\ndoors appeared – a red one, a blue one and a green one. Opening a door cost a\npoint, but for every room they entered, they could accrue more points. The players\nreacted logically: they found the most fruitful room, and holed up there for the\nwhole session. Ariely and Shin then changed the rules. If doors were not opened\nwithin twelve moves, they started shrinking on the screen and eventually\nvanished. Players now rushed from door to door to secure access to all potential\ntreasure troves. All this unproductive scrambling meant they scored 15% fewer\npoints than in the previous game. The organisers then added another twist:\nopening doors now cost three points. The same anxiety kicked in: players frittered\naway their points trying to keep all doors open. Even when the subjects learned\nhow many points were hidden in each room, nothing changed. Sacriﬁcing options\nwas a price they were not willing to pay.\nWhy do we act so irrationally? Because the downside to such behaviour is not\nalways apparent. In the ﬁnancial markets, things are clear: a ﬁnancial option on a\nsecurity always costs something. There is no such thing as a free option, but in\nmost other realms, options seem to be free. This is an illusion, however. They\nalso come at a price, but the price tag is often hidden and intangible: each\ndecision costs mental energy and eats up precious time for thinking and living.\nCEOs who examine every possible expansion option often choose none in the\nend. Companies that aim to address all customer segments end up addressing\nno one. Salespeople who chase every single lead close no deals.\nWe are obsessed with having as many irons as possible in the ﬁre, ruling\nnothing out and being open to everything. However, this can easily destroy\nsuccess. We must learn to close doors. A business strategy is primarily a\nstatement on what \nnot\n to engage in. Adopt a life strategy similar to a corporate\nstrategy: write down what \nnot\n to pursue in your life. In other words, make\ncalculated decisions to disregard certain possibilities and when an option shows\nup, test it against your not-to-pursue list. It will not only keep you from trouble but\nalso save you lots of thinking time. Think hard once and then just consult your list\ninstead of having to make up your mind whenever a new door cracks open. Most\ndoors are not worth going through, even when the handle seems to turn so\neffortlessly.\nSee also \nSunk Cost Fallacy\n (ch. 5);\n Action Bias\n (ch. 43)\n69\nDISREGARD THE BRAND NEW\nNeomania\nHow will the world look in ﬁfty years? What will your everyday life be like? With\nwhich items will you surround yourself?\nPeople who pondered this question ﬁfty years ago had fanciful notions of how\n‘the future’ would look: highways in the skies. Cities that resemble glass worlds.\nBullet trains winding between gleaming skyscrapers. We would live in plastic\ncapsules, work in underwater cities, vacation on the moon and consume\neverything in pill form. We wouldn’t conceive offspring any more; instead we\nwould choose children from a catalogue. Our best friends would be robots, death\nwould be cured and we would have exchanged our bikes for jetpacks long ago.\nBut hang on a second. Take a look around. You’re sitting in a chair, an\ninvention from ancient Egypt. You wear pants, developed about 5,000 years ago\nand adapted by Germanic tribes around 750 B.C. The idea behind your leather\nshoes comes from the last ice age. Your bookshelves are made of wood, one of\nthe oldest building materials in the world. At dinnertime, you use a fork, a well-\nknown ‘killer app’ from Roman times, to shovel chunks of dead animals and\nplants into your mouths. Nothing has changed.\nSo, how will the world look in ﬁfty years? In his book \nAntifragile\n, Nassim Taleb\ngives us a clue: assume that most of the technology that has existed for the past\nﬁfty years will serve us for another half-century. And assume that recent\ntechnology will be passé in a few years’ time. Why? Think of these inventions as\nif they were species: whatever has held its own throughout centuries of\ninnovation will probably continue to do so in the future, too. Old technology has\nproven itself; it possesses an inherent logic even if we do not always understand\nit. If something has endured for epochs, it must be worth its salt. You can take this\nto heart the next time you are in a strategy meeting. Fifty years into the future will\nlook a lot like today. Of course, you will witness the birth of many ﬂashy gadgets\nand magic contraptions. But most will be short-lived.\nWhen contemplating the future, we place far too much emphasis on ﬂavour-of-\nthe-month inventions and the latest ‘killer apps’, while underestimating the role of\ntraditional technology. In the 1960s, space travel was all the rage, so we\nimagined ourselves on school trips to Mars. In the 1970s, plastic was in, so we\nmulled over how we would furnish our see-through houses. Taleb traces this\ntendency back to the \nneomania\n pitfall: the mania for all things shiny and new.\nIn the past, I sympathised with so-called ‘early adopters’, the breed of people\nwho cannot survive without the latest iPhone. I thought they were ahead of their\ntime. Now I regard them as irrational and suffering from a kind of sickness:\nneomania\n. To them, it is of minor importance if an invention provides tangible\nbenefits; novelty matters more.\nSo, don’t go out on a limb when forecasting the future. Stanley Kubrick’s cult\nmovie, \n2001: A Space Odyssey\n, illustrates why you shouldn’t. Made in 1968, the\nmovie predicted that, at the turn of the millennium, the U.S. would have a\nthousand-strong colony on the moon and that PanAm would operate the\ncommuter ﬂights there and back. With this fanciful forecast in mind, I suggest this\nrule of thumb: whatever has survived for X years will last another X years. Taleb\nwagers that the ‘bullshit ﬁlter of history’ will sort the gimmicks from the game-\nchangers. And that’s one bet I’m willing to back.\nSee also \nHedonic Treadmill\n (ch. 46)\n70\nWHY PROPAGANDA WORKS\nSleeper Effect\nDuring World War II, every nation produced propaganda movies. These were\ndevised to ﬁll the population, especially soldiers, with enthusiasm for their country\nand, if necessary, to bolster them to lay down their lives. The U.S. spent so much\nmoney on propaganda that the war department decided to ﬁnd out whether the\nexpense was really worth it. A number of studies were carried out to investigate\nhow the movies affected regular soldiers. The result was disappointing: they did\nnot intensify the privates’ enthusiasm for war in the slightest.\nWas it because they were poorly made? Hardly. Rather, the soldiers were\naware that the movies were propaganda, which discredited their message even\nbefore they were rolling. Even if the movie argued a point reasonably or managed\nto stir the audience, it didn’t matter; its content was deemed hollow from the outset\nand dismissed.\nNine weeks later, something unexpected happened. The psychologists\nmeasured the soldiers’ attitudes a second time. The result: whoever had seen the\nmovie expressed much more support for the war than those who had not viewed\nit. Apparently, propaganda did work after all!\nThe scientists were bafﬂed, especially since they knew that an argument’s\npersuasiveness decreased over time. It has a half-life like a radioactive\nsubstance. Surely you have experienced this yourself: let’s say you read an\narticle on the beneﬁts of gene therapy. Immediately after reading it you are a\nzealous convert, but after a few weeks, you don’t really remember why. More time\npasses until, finally, only a tiny fraction of enthusiasm remains.\nAmazingly, just the opposite is true for propaganda. If it strikes a chord with\nsomeone, this inﬂuence will only increase over time. Why? Psychologist Carl\nHovland, who led the study for the war department, named this phenomenon the\nsleeper effect\n. To date, the best explanation is that, in our memories, the \nsource\n of\nthe argument fades faster than the argument. In other words, your brain quickly\nforgets where the information came from (e.g. from the department of\npropaganda). Meanwhile, the message itself (i.e., war is necessary and noble)\nfades only slowly or even endures. Therefore, any knowledge that stems from an\nuntrustworthy source gains credibility over time. The discrediting force melts\naway faster than the message does.\nIn the U.S., elections increasingly revolve around nasty advertisements, in\nwhich candidates seek to tarnish each another’s record or reputation. However,\nby law, each political ad must disclose its sponsor at the end so that it is clearly\ndistinguishable as an electioneering message. However, countless studies show\nthat the \nsleeper effect\n does its job here, too, especially among undecided voters.\nThe messenger fades from memory; the ugly accusations persevere.\nI’ve often wondered why advertising works at all. Any logical person must\nrecognise ads for what they are, and suitably categorise and disqualify them. But\neven you as a discerning and intelligent reader won’t always succeed at this. It’s\nquite possible that, after a few weeks, you won’t remember if you picked up\ncertain information from a well-researched article or from a tacky advertorial.\nHow can you thwart the \nsleeper effect\n? First, don’t accept any unsolicited\nadvice, even if it seems well meant. Doing so, you protect yourself to a certain\ndegree from manipulation. Second, avoid ad-contaminated sources like the\nplague. How fortunate we are that books are (still) ad-free! Third, try to remember\nthe source of every argument you encounter. Whose opinions are these? And\nwhy do they think that way? Probe the issue like an investigator would: \ncui bono\n?\nWho beneﬁts? Admittedly, this is a lot of work and will slow down your decision-\nmaking. But it will also refine it.\nSee also \nFraming\n (ch. 42); \nPrimacy and Recency Effects\n (ch. 73); \nNews Illusion\n (ch. 99)\n71\nWHY IT’S NEVER JUST A TWO-HORSE RACE\nAlternative Blindness\nYou leaf through a brochure that gushes about the beneﬁts of the university’s\nMBA degree. Your gaze sweeps over photos of the ivy-covered campus and the\nultra-modern sports facilities. Sprinkled throughout are images of smiling students\nfrom various ethnic backgrounds with an emphasis on young women, young\nChinese and young Indian go-getters. On the last page you come to an overview\nthat illustrates the ﬁnancial value of an MBA. The $100,000 fee is easily offset by\nthe statistical extra income that graduates earn before they retire: $400,000 – \nafter\ntaxes. Who wouldn’t want to be up $300,000? It’s a no-brainer.\nWrong. Such an argument hides not one, but four fallacies. First, we have the\nswimmer’s body illusion\n:\n \nMBA programmes attract career-oriented people who\nwill probably earn above-average salaries at some stage of their careers, even\nwithout the extra qualiﬁcation of an MBA. The second fallacy: an MBA takes two\nyears. During this time you can expect a loss of earnings – say, $100,000. So in\nfact, the MBA costs $200,000, not $100,000. That amount, if invested well, could\neasily exceed the additional income that the brochure promises. Third, to\nestimate earnings that are more than thirty years away is idiotic. Who knows what\nwill happen over the next three decades? Finally, other alternatives exist. You are\nnot stuck between ‘do an MBA’ and ‘don’t do an MBA’. Perhaps you can ﬁnd a\ndifferent programme that costs signiﬁcantly less and also represents a shot in the\narm for your career. This fourth misconception interests me the most. Let’s call it\nalternative blindness\n: we systematically forget to compare an existing offer with\nthe next-best alternative.\nHere’s an example from the world of ﬁnance. Suppose you have a little money\nin your savings account and you ask your investment broker for advice. He\nproposes a bond that will earn you 5% interest. ‘That’s much better than the 1%\nyou get with your savings account,’ he points out. Does it make sense to buy the\nbond? We don’t know. It’s wrong to consider just these two options. To assess\nyour options properly, you would have to compare the bond with all other\ninvestment options and then select the best. This is how top investor Warren\nBuffett does things: ‘Each deal we measure against the second-best deal that is\navailable at any given time – even if it means doing more of what we are already\ndoing.’\nUnlike Warren Buffett, politicians often fall victim to \nalternative blindness\n. Let’s\nsay your city is planning to build a sports arena on a vacant plot of land.\nSupporters argue that such an arena would beneﬁt the population much more\nthan an empty lot – both emotionally and ﬁnancially. But this comparison is\nwrong. They should compare the construction of the sports arena with all other\nideas that become impossible due to its construction – for example, building a\nschool, a performing arts centre, a hospital or an incinerator. They could also sell\nthe land, and invest the proceeds or reduce the city’s debt.\nAnd you? Do you often overlook the alternatives? Let’s say your doctor\ndiscovers a tumour that will kill you in ﬁve years. He proposes a complicated\noperation, which, if successful, removes the tumour completely. However, this\nprocedure is highly risky with a survival rate of just 50%. How do you decide?\nYou weigh up your choices: certain death in ﬁve years or a 50% chance of dying\nnext week. \nAlternative blindness\n! Perhaps there is a variant of the invasive\nsurgery that your hospital doesn’t offer, but a hospital across town does. This\ninvasive surgery might not remove the tumour altogether, just slow its growth, but\nis much safer and gives you an extra ten years. And who knows, maybe during\nthese ten years a more sophisticated therapy for eradicating tumours will be\nmade available.\nThe bottom line: if you have trouble making a decision, remember that the\nchoices are broader than ‘no surgery’ or ‘highly risky surgery’. Forget about the\nrock and the hard place, and open your eyes to the other, superior alternatives.\nSee also \nParadox of Choice\n (ch. 21); \nSwimmer’s Body Illusion\n (ch. 2)\n72\nWHY WE TAKE AIM AT YOUNG GUNS\nSocial Comparison Bias\nAs one of my books reached number one on the bestseller list, my publisher\nasked me for a favour. An acquaintance’s title was on the verge of entering the\ntop ten list, and the publisher was convinced that a testimonial from me would\ngive it the necessary push.\nIt always amazes me that these little testimonials work at all. Everyone knows\nthat only favourable comments end up on a book’s jacket. (The book you hold in\nyour hands is no exception.) A rational reader should ignore the praise, or at least\nconsider it alongside the criticism, which is always available, albeit in different\nplaces. Nevertheless, I’ve written plenty of testimonials for other books, but they\nwere never for rival titles. I hesitated: wouldn’t writing a blurb be cutting off my\nnose to spite my face? Why should I help someone who might soon vie with me\nfor the top slot? As I pondered the question, I realised s\nocial comparison bias\n had\nkicked in – that is, the tendency to withhold assistance to people who might outdo\nyou, even if you look like a fool in the long run.\nBook testimonials are a harmless example of the \nsocial comparison bias\n.\nHowever, the phenomenon has reached toxic levels in academia. Every\nscientist’s goal is to publish as many articles as possible in the most prestigious\nscientiﬁc journals. Over time, you make a name for yourself, and soon editors ask\nyou to assess other scientists’ submissions. In the end, often just two or three\nexperts decide what gets published in a particular ﬁeld. Taking this into account,\nwhat happens if a young researcher sends in an earth-shattering paper that turns\nthe entire department on its head and threatens to knock them off their thrones?\nThey will be especially rigorous when evaluating the article. That’s \nsocial\ncomparison bias \nhard at work.\nThe psychologist Stephen Garcia and his fellow researchers describe the case\nof a Nobel laureate who prevented a promising young colleague from applying for\na job at ‘his’ university. This may seem judicious in the short term, but in the long\nrun, it is counterproductive. What happens when that young prodigy joins another\nresearch group and applies his acumen there – most likely preventing the old\ninstitution from maintaining its world-class status? Garcia suggests that\n social\ncomparison bias\n may well be the reason why hardly any research groups remain\nat the top for many years in succession.\nThe \nsocial comparison bias\n is also a cause for concern with start-up\ncompanies. Guy Kawasaki was ‘chief evangelist’ at Apple for four years. Today\nhe is a venture capitalist and advises entrepreneurs. Kawasaki says: ‘A-players\nhire people even better than themselves. It’s clear, though, that B-players hire C-\nplayers so they can feel superior to them, and C-players hire D-players. If you\nstart hiring B-players, expect what Steve [Jobs] called “the bozo explosion” to\nhappen in your organisation.’ In other words, start hiring B-players and you end\nup with Z-players. Recommendation: hire people who are better than you,\notherwise you soon preside over a pack of underdogs. The so-called \nDuning–\nKruger effect \napplies to such Z-players: the inept are gifted at overlooking the\nextent of their incompetence. They suffer from illusory superiority, which leads\nthem to make even more thinking errors, thus creating a vicious cycle that erodes\nthe talent pool over time.\nWhile his school was closed due to an outbreak of plague in 1666–7, 25-year-\nold Isaac Newton showed his professor, Isaac Barrow, what research he was\nconducting in his spare time. Barrow immediately gave up his job as a professor\nand became a student of Newton. What a noble gesture. What ethical behaviour.\nWhen was the last time you heard of a professor vacating his post in favour of a\nbetter candidate? And when was the last time you read about a CEO clearing out\nhis desk when he realised that one of his 20,000 employees could do a better\njob?\nIn conclusion: do you foster individuals more talented than you? Admittedly, in\nthe short term the preponderance of stars can endanger your status, but in the\nlong run, you can only proﬁt from their contributions. Others will overtake you at\nsome stage anyway. Until then, you should get in the up-and-comers’ good books\n– and learn from them. This is why I wrote the testimonial in the end.\nSee also \nEnvy\n (ch. 86);\n Contrast Effect\n (ch. 10)\n73\nWHY FIRST IMPRESSIONS DECEIVE\nPrimacy and Recency Effects\nAllow me to introduce you to two men, Alan and Ben. Without thinking about it too\nlong, decide who you prefer. Alan is smart, hard-working, impulsive, critical,\nstubborn and jealous. Ben, however, is jealous, stubborn, critical, impulsive,\nhard-working and smart. Who would you prefer to get stuck in an elevator with?\nMost people choose Alan, even though the descriptions are exactly the same.\nYour brain pays more attention to the ﬁrst adjectives in the lists, causing you to\nidentify two different personalities. Alan is smart and hard-working. Ben is jealous\nand stubborn. The first traits outshine the rest. This is called the \nprimacy\n \neffect\n.\nIf it were not for the \nprimacy effect\n, people would refrain from decking out their\nheadquarters with luxuriously appointed entrance halls. Your lawyer would feel\nhappy turning up to meet you in worn-out sneakers rather than beautifully\npolished designer Oxfords.\nThe \nprimacy effect\n triggers practical errors too. Nobel laureate Daniel\nKahneman describes how he used to grade examination papers at the beginning\nof his professorship. He did it as most teachers do – in order: student 1 followed\nby student 2 and so on. This meant that students who answered the ﬁrst\nquestions ﬂawlessly endeared themselves to him, thus affecting how he graded\nthe remaining parts of their exams. So, Kahneman switched methods and began\nto grade the individual questions in batches – all the answers to question one,\nthen the answers to question two, and so forth. Thus, he cancelled out the\nprimacy effect\n.\nUnfortunately, this trick is not always replicable. When recruiting a new\nemployee, for example, you run the risk of hiring the person who makes the best\nﬁrst impression. Ideally, you would set up all the candidates in order and let them\nanswer the same question one after the other.\nSuppose you sit on the board of a company. A point of discussion is raised – a\ntopic on which you have not yet passed judgement. The ﬁrst opinion you hear will\nbe crucial to your overall assessment. The same applies to the other participants,\na fact that you can exploit: if you have an opinion, don’t hesitate to air it ﬁrst. This\nway, you will inﬂuence your colleagues more and draw them over to your side. If,\nhowever, you are chairing the committee, always ask members’ opinions in\nrandom order so that no one has an unfair advantage.\nThe \nprimacy effect\n is not always the culprit; the contrasting \nrecency effect\nmatters as well. The more recent the information, the better we remember it. This\noccurs because our short-term memory ﬁle drawer, as it were, contains very little\nextra space. When a new piece of information gets ﬁled, an older piece of\ninformation is discarded to make room.\nWhen does the \nprimacy effect\n supersede the \nrecency effect\n, or vice versa? If\nyou have to make an immediate decision based on a series of ‘impressions’\n(such as characteristics, exam answers etc.), the \nprimacy effect\n weighs heavier.\nBut if the series of impressions was formed some time ago, the \nrecency effect\ndominates. For instance, if you listened to a speech a few weeks ago, you will\nremember the final point or punchline more clearly than your first impressions.\nIn conclusion: ﬁrst and last impressions dominate, meaning that the content\nsandwiched between has only a weak inﬂuence. Try to avoid evaluations based\non ﬁrst impressions. They will deceive you, guaranteed, in one way or another.\nTry to assess all aspects impartially. It’s not easy, but there are ways around it.\nFor example, in interviews, I jot down a score every five minutes and calculate the\naverage afterward. This way, I make sure that the ‘middle’ counts just as much as\nhello and goodbye.\nSee also \nIllusion of Attention\n (ch. 88);\n Sleeper Effect\n (ch. 70);\n Salience Effect\n (ch. 83)\n74\nWHY YOU CAN’T BEAT HOME-MADE\nNot-Invented-Here Syndrome\nMy cooking skills are quite modest, and my wife knows it. However, every now\nand then I concoct a dish that could pass for edible. A few weeks ago, I bought\nsome sole. Determined to escape the monotony of familiar sauces, I devised a\nnew one – a daring combination of white wine, pureed pistachio nuts, honey,\ngrated orange peel and a dash of balsamic vinegar. Upon tasting it, my wife slid\nher baked sole to the edge of the plate and began to scrape off the sauce, smiling\nruefully as she did so. I, on the other hand, didn’t think it was bad at all. I\nexplained to her in detail what a bold creation she was missing, but her\nexpression stayed the same.\nTwo weeks later, we were having sole again. This time my wife did the\ncooking. She prepared two sauces: the ﬁrst her tried-and-true \nbeurre blanc\n, and\nthe other a new recipe from a top French chef. The second tasted horrible.\nAfterward, she confessed that it was not a French recipe at all, but a Swiss one:\nmy masterpiece from two weeks before! She had caught me out. I was guilty of\nthe \nNot-Invented-Here syndrome\n (\nNIH syndrome\n), which fools us into thinking\nanything we create ourselves is unbeatable.\nNIH syndrome\n causes you to fall in love with your own ideas. This is valid not\nonly for ﬁsh sauces, but also for all kinds of solutions, business ideas and\ninventions. Companies tend to rate home-grown ideas as far more important than\nthose from outsiders, even if, objectively, this is not the case. I recently had lunch\nwith the CEO of a company that specialises in software for health insurance ﬁrms.\nHe told me how difﬁcult it is to sell his software to potential customers, even\nthough his ﬁrm is the market leader in terms of service, security and functionality.\nMost insurers are convinced that the best solution is what they have crafted\nthemselves in-house over the past thirty years. Another CEO told me how hard it\nis to get his staff in the company’s headquarters to accept solutions proposed\nfrom far-flung subsidiaries.\nWhen people collaborate to solve problems and then evaluate these ideas\nthemselves, \nNIH syndrome\n will inevitably exert an inﬂuence. Thus, it makes\nsense to split teams into two groups. The ﬁrst group generates ideas; the second\nrates them. Then they swap: the second team comes up with ideas and the ﬁrst\nteam rates them. We tend to rate our own business ideas as more successful than\nother people’s concepts. This self-conﬁdence forms the basis of thriving\nentrepreneurship, but also explains start-ups’ frequently miserable returns.\nThis is how psychologist Dan Ariely measured the \nNIH syndrome\n. Writing in\nhis blog at the \nNew York Times\n, Ariely asked readers to provide solutions to six\nissues, such as ‘How can cities reduce water consumption without limiting it by\nlaw?’ The readers had to make suggestions, and also assess the feasibility of all\nthe ideas proposed. They also had to specify how much of their time and money\nthey would invest in each idea. Finally, they were limited to using a set list of ﬁfty\nwords, ensuring that everyone gave more or less the same answers. Despite this,\nthe majority rated their own responses as more important and applicable than the\nothers, even though the submissions were virtually identical.\nOn a societal level, \nNIH syndrome\n has serious consequences. We overlook\nshrewd ideas simply because they come from other cultures. In Switzerland,\nwhere each state or ‘canton’ has certain powers, one tiny canton never approved\nwomen’s suffrage; it took a federal court ruling in 1990 to change the law – a\nstartling case of \nNIH\n. Or consider the modern trafﬁc roundabout, with its clear\nyield requirements, that was designed by British transport engineers in the 1960s\nand implemented throughout the U.K. It took another thirty years full of oblivion\nand resistance until this obvious traffic decongestant found its way in the U.S. and\ncontinental Europe. Today France alone has more than 30,000 roundabouts –\nwhich the French now probably falsely attribute to the designer of the Place de\nl’Étoile.\nIn conclusion: we are drunk on our own ideas. To sober up, take a step back\nevery now and then to examine their quality in hindsight. Which of your ideas\nfrom the past ten years were truly outstanding?

Every snowy\nspecimen corroborated this. A swan in a different colour? Unthinkable. That was\nuntil the year 1697, when Willem de Vlamingh saw a black swan for the ﬁrst time\nduring an expedition to Australia. Since then, black swans have become symbols\nof the improbable.\nYou invest money in the stock market. Year in, year out, the Dow Jones rises\nand falls a little. Gradually, you grow accustomed to this gentle up and down.\nThen, suddenly, a day like 19 October 1987 comes around and the stock market\ntumbles 22%. With no warning. This event is a Black Swan, as described by\nNassim Taleb in his book with the same title.\nA \nBlack Swan\n is an unthinkable event that massively affects your life, your\ncareer, your company, your country. There are positive and negative \nBlack\nSwans\n. The meteorite that ﬂattens you, Sutter’s discovery of gold in California,\nthe collapse of the Soviet Union, the invention of the transistor, the Internet\nbrowser, the overthrow of Egyptian dictator Mubarak or another encounter that\nupturns your life completely – all are \nBlack Swans\n.\nThink what you like of former U.S. secretary of defence Donald Rumsfeld, but\nat a press conference in 2002, he expressed a philosophical thought with\nexceptional clarity when he offered this observation: there are things we know\n(‘known facts’), there are things we do not know (‘known unknowns’) and there\nare things that we do not know that we do not know (‘unknown unknowns’).\nHow big is the universe? Does Iran have nuclear weapons? Does the Internet\nmake us smarter or dumber? These are ‘known unknowns’. With enough effort,\nwe can hope to answer these one day. Unlike the ‘unknown unknowns’. No one\nforesaw Facebook mania ten years ago. It is a \nBlack Swan\n.\nWhy are \nBlack Swans\n important? Because, as absurd as it may sound, they\nare cropping up more and more frequently and they tend to become more\nconsequential. Though we can continue to plan for the future, \nBlack Swans\n often\ndestroy our best-laid plans. Feedback loops and non-linear inﬂuences interact\nand cause unexpected results. The reason: our brains are designed to help us\nhunt and gather. Back in the Stone Age, we hardly ever encountered anything\ntruly extraordinary. The deer we chased was sometimes a bit faster or slower,\nsometimes a little bit fatter or thinner. Everything revolved around a stable mean.\nToday is different. With one breakthrough, you can increase your income by a\nfactor of 10,000. Just ask Larry Page, Usain Bolt, George Soros, J.K. Rowling or\nBono. Such fortunes did not exist previously; peaks of this size were unknown.\nOnly in the most recent of human history has this been possible – hence our\nproblem with extreme scenarios. Since probabilities cannot fall below zero, and\nour thought processes are prone to error, you should assume that everything has\nan above-zero probability.\nSo, what can be done? Put yourself in situations where you can catch a ride on\na positive \nBlack Swan\n (as unlikely as that is). Become an artist, inventor or\nentrepreneur with a scaleable product. If you sell your time (e.g. as an employee,\ndentist or journalist), you are waiting in vain for such a break. But even if you feel\ncompelled to continue as such, avoid surroundings where negative \nBlack Swans\nthrive. This means: stay out of debt, invest your savings as conservatively as\npossible and get used to a modest standard of living – no matter whether your big\nbreakthrough comes or not.\nSee also \nAmbiguity Aversion\n (ch. 80);\n Forecast Illusion\n (ch. 40);\n Alternative Paths\n (ch.\n39);\n Expectations\n (ch. 62)\n76\nKNOWLEDGE IS NON-TRANSFERABLE\nDomain Dependence\nWriting books about clear thinking brings with it many pluses. Business leaders\nand investors invite me to give talks for good money. (Incidentally, this is in itself\npoor judgement on their part: books are much cheaper.) At a medical conference,\nthe following happened to me. I was speaking about \nbase-rate neglect\n and\nillustrated it with a medical example: in a 40-year-old patient, stabbing chest pain\nmay (among other things) indicate heart problems, or it may indicate stress.\nStress is much more frequent (with a higher base rate), so it is advisable to test\nthe patient for this ﬁrst. All this is very reasonable and the doctors understood it\nintuitively. But when I used an example from economics, most faltered.\nThe same thing happens when I speak in front of investors. If I illustrate\nfallacies using ﬁnancial examples, most catch on immediately. However, if I take\ninstances from biology, many are lost. The conclusion: insights do not pass well\nfrom one field to another. This effect is called \ndomain dependence\n.\nIn 1990, Harry Markowitz received the Nobel Prize for Economics for his theory\nof ‘portfolio selection’. It describes the optimum composition of a portfolio, taking\ninto account both risk and return prospects. When it came to Markowitz’s own\nportfolio – how he should allot his savings in stocks and bonds – he simply opted\nfor 50/50 distribution: half in shares, the other half in bonds. The Nobel Prize\nwinner was incapable of applying his ingenious process to his own affairs. A\nblatant case of \ndomain dependence\n. He failed to transfer knowledge from the\nacademic world to the private sphere.\nA friend of mine is a hopeless adrenaline junkie, scaling overhanging cliffs with\nhis bare hands and launching himself off mountains in a wingsuit. He explained\nto me last week why starting a business is dangerous: bankruptcy can never be\nruled out. ‘Personally, I’d rather be bankrupt than dead,’ I replied. He didn’t\nappreciate my logic.\nAs an author, I realise just how difﬁcult it is to transfer skills to a new area. For\nme, devising plots for my novels and creating characters are a cinch. A blank,\nempty page doesn’t daunt me. It’s quite a different story with, say, an empty\napartment. When it comes to interior decor, I can stand in the room for hours,\nhands in my pockets, devoid of one single idea.\nBusiness is teeming with \ndomain dependence\n. A software company recruits a\nsuccessful consumer-goods salesman. The new position blunts his talents;\ntransferring his sales skills from products to services is exceedingly difﬁcult.\nSimilarly, a presenter who is outstanding in front of small groups may well tank\nwhen his audience reaches 100 people. Or a talented marketing mind may be\npromoted to CEO and suddenly find that he lacks any strategic creativity.\nWith the Markowitz example, we saw that the transfer from the professional\nrealm to the private realm is particularly difficult to navigate. I know CEOs who are\ncharismatic leaders in the ofﬁce and hopeless duds at home. Similarly, it would\nbe a hard task to ﬁnd a more cigarette-toting profession than the prophets of\nhealth themselves, the doctors. Police ofﬁcers are twice as violent at home as\ncivilians. Literary critics’ novels get the poorest reviews. And, almost proverbially,\nthe marriages of couples’ therapists are frequently more fragile than those of their\nclients. Mathematics professor Barry Mazur tells this story: ‘Some years\nago I was\ntrying to decide whether or not I should move from Stanford to Harvard. I had\nbored my friends silly with endless discussion. Finally, one of them said, “You’re\none of our leading decision theorists. Maybe you should make a list of the costs\nand beneﬁts and try to roughly calculate your expected utility.” Without thinking, I\nblurted out, “Come on, Sandy, this is serious.”’\nWhat you master in one area is difﬁcult to transfer to another. Especially\ndaunting is the transfer from academia to real life – from the theoretically sound to\nthe practically possible. Of course, this also counts for this book. It will be difﬁcult\nto transfer the knowledge from these pages to your daily life. Even for me as the\nwriter that transition proves to be a tough one. Book smarts doesn’t transfer to\nstreet smarts easily.\nSee also \nDéformation Professionelle\n (ch. 92);\n Chauffeur Knowledge\n (ch. 16);\n Twaddle\nTendency\n (ch. 57)\n77\nTHE MYTH OF LIKE-MINDEDNESS\nFalse-Consensus Effect\nWhich do you prefer: music from the 1960s or music from the 1980s? How do you\nthink the general public would answer this question? Most people tend to\nextrapolate their preferences on to others. If they love the 1960s, they will\nautomatically assume that the majority of their peers do, too. The same goes for\n1980s aﬁcionados. We frequently overestimate unanimity with others, believing\nthat everyone else thinks and feels exactly like we do. This fallacy is called the\nfalse-consensus effect\n.\nStanford psychologist Lee Ross hit upon this in 1977. He fashioned a\nsandwich board emblazoned with the slogan ‘Eat at Joe’s’ and asked randomly\nselected students to wear it around campus for thirty minutes. They also had to\nestimate how many other students would put themselves forward for the task.\nThose who declared themselves willing to wear the sign assumed that the\nmajority (62%) would also agree to it. On the other hand, those who politely\nrefused believed that most people (67%) would ﬁnd it too stupid to undertake. In\nboth cases, the students imagined themselves to be in the popular majority.\nThe \nfalse-consensus effect\n thrives in interest groups and political factions that\nconsistently overrate the popularity of their causes. An obvious example is global\nwarming. However critical you consider the issue to be, you probably believe that\nthe majority of people share your opinion. Similarly, if politicians are conﬁdent of\nelection, it’s not just blind optimism: they cannot help overestimating their\npopularity.\nArtists are even worse off. In 99% of new projects, they expect to achieve more\nsuccess than ever before. A personal example: I was completely convinced that\nmy novel, \nMassimo Marini\n, would be a resounding success. It was at least as\ngood as my previous books, I thought, and those had done very well. But the\npublic was of a different opinion and I was proven wrong: \nfalse-consensus effect\n.\nOf course, the business world is equally prone to such false conclusions. Just\nbecause an R&D department is convinced of its product’s appeal doesn’t mean\nconsumers will think the same way. Companies with tech people in charge are\nespecially affected. Inventors fall in love with their products’ sophisticated\nfeatures and mistakenly believe that these will bowl customers over, too.\nThe \nfalse-consensus effect\n is fascinating for yet another reason. If people do\nnot share our opinions, we categorise them as ‘abnormal’. Ross’s experiment\nalso corroborated this: the students who wore the sandwich board considered\nthose who refused to be stuck up and humourless, whereas the other camp saw\nthe sign-wearers as idiots and attention seekers.\nPerhaps you remember the fallacy of \nsocial proof\n, the notion that an idea is\nbetter the more people believe in it. Is the \nfalse-consensus effect\n identical? No.\nSocial proof\n is an evolutionary survival strategy. Following the crowd has saved\nour butts more often in the past 100,000 years than striking out on our own. With\nthe \nfalse-consensus effect\n, no outside inﬂuences are involved. Despite this, it still\nhas a social function, which is why evolution didn’t eliminate it. Our brain is not\nbuilt to recognise the truth; instead its goal is to leave behind as many offspring\nas possible. Whoever seemed courageous and convincing (thanks to the \nfalse-\nconsensus effect\n) created a positive impression, attracted a disproportionate\namount of resources, and thus increased their chances of passing on their genes\nto future generations. Doubters were less sexy.\nIn conclusion: assume that your worldview is not borne by the public. More than\nthat: do not assume that those who think differently are idiots. Before you distrust\nthem, question your own assumptions.\nSee also \nSocial Proof\n (ch. 4);\n Not-Invented-Here Syndrome\n (ch. 74)\n78\nYOU WERE RIGHT ALL ALONG\nFalsification of History\nWinston Smith, a frail, brooding, 39-year-old ofﬁce employee, works in the\nMinistry of Truth. His job is to update old newspaper articles and documents so\nthat they agree with new developments. His work is important. Revising the past\ncreates the illusion of infallibility and helps the government secure absolute\npower.\nSuch historical misrepresentation, as witnessed in George Orwell’s classic\n1984\n, is alive and well today. It may shock you but a little Winston is scribbling\naway in your brain, too. Worse still: whereas in Orwell’s novel, he toiled\nunwillingly and eventually rebelled against the system, in your brain he is\nworking with the utmost efﬁciency and according to your wishes and goals. He\nwill never rise up against you. He revises your memories so effortlessly –\nelegantly, even – that you never notice his work. Discreet and reliable, Winston\ndisposes of your old, mistaken views. As they vanish one by one, you start to\nbelieve you were right all along.\nIn 1973, U.S. political scientist Gregory Markus asked 3,000 people to share\ntheir opinions on controversial political issues, such as the legalisation of drugs.\nTheir responses ranged from ‘fully agree’ to ‘completely disagree’. Ten years\nlater, he interviewed them again on the same topics, and also asked what they\nhad replied ten years previously. The result: what they recalled disclosing in 1973\nwas almost identical to their present-day views – and a far cry from their original\nresponses.\nBy subconsciously adjusting past views to ﬁt present ones, we avoid any\nembarrassing proof of our fallibility. It’s a clever coping strategy, because no\nmatter how tough we are, admitting mistakes is an emotionally difﬁcult task. But\nthis is preposterous. Shouldn’t we let out a whoop of joy every time we realise we\nare wrong? After all, such admissions would ensure we will never make the same\nmistake twice and have essentially taken a step forward. But we do not see it that\nway.\nSo does this mean our brains contain no accurately etched memories? Surely\nnot! After all, you can recall the exact moment when you met your partner as if it\nwere captured in a photo. And you can remember exactly where you were on 11\nSeptember 2001 when you learned of the terrorist attack in New York, right? You\nrecall to whom you were speaking and how you felt. Your memories of 9/11 are\nextraordinarily vivid and detailed. Psychologists call these \nﬂashbulb memories\n:\nthey feel as incontestable as photographs.\nThey are not. \nFlashbulb memories\n are as ﬂawed as regular recollections. They\nare the product of reconstruction. Ulrich Neisser, one of the pioneers in the ﬁeld of\ncognitive science, investigated\n \nthem. In 1986, the day after the explosion of the\nChallenger\n space shuttle, he asked students to write essays detailing their\nreactions. Three years later, he interviewed them again. Less than seven per cent\nof the new data correlated with the initial submissions. In fact, 50% of the\nrecollections were incorrect in two-thirds of the points, and 25% failed to match\neven a single detail. Neisser took one of these conﬂicting papers and presented it\nto its owner. Her answer: ‘I know it’s my handwriting, but I couldn’t have written\nthis.’ The question remains: why do \nﬂashbulb memories\n feel so real? We don’t\nknow yet.\nIt is safe to assume that half of what you remember is wrong. Our memories are\nriddled with inaccuracies, including the seemingly ﬂawless \nﬂashbulb memories\n.\nOur faith in them can be harmless – or lethal. Consider the widespread use of\neyewitness testimony and police line-ups to identify criminals. To trust such\naccounts without additional investigation is reckless, even if the witnesses are\nadamant that they would easily recognise the perpetrator again.\nSee also \nHindsight Bias\n (ch. 14);\n Story Bias\n (ch. 13);\n Fallacy of the Single Cause\n (ch.\n97)\n79\nWHY YOU IDENTIFY WITH YOUR FOOTBALL TEAM\nIn-Group Out-Group Bias\nWhen I was a child, a typical wintry Sunday looked like this: my family sat in front\nof the TV watching a ski race. My parents cheered for the Swiss skiers and\nwanted me to do the same. I didn’t understand the fuss. First, why zoom down a\nmountain on two planks? It makes as little sense as hopping up the mountain on\none leg, while juggling three balls and stopping every 100 feet to hurl a log as far\nas possible. Second, how can one-hundredth of a second count as a difference?\nCommon sense would say that if people are that close together, they are equally\ngood skiers. Third, why should I identify with the Swiss skiers? Was I related to\nany of them? I didn’t think so. I didn’t even know what they thought or read, and if I\nlived a few feet over the Swiss border, I would probably (have to) cheer for\nanother team altogether.\nThis brings us to the question: does identifying with a group – a sports team, an\nethnicity, a company, a state – represent flawed thinking?\nOver thousands of years, evolution has shaped every behavioural pattern,\nincluding attraction to certain groups. In times past, group membership was vital.\nFending for yourself was close to impossible. As people began to form alliances,\nall had to follow suit. Individuals stood no chance against collectives. Whoever\nrejected membership or got expelled forfeited their place not only in the group, but\nalso in the gene pool. No wonder we are such social animals – our ancestors\nwere, too.\nPsychologists have investigated different group effects. These can be neatly\ncategorised under the term \nin-group-out-group bias\n. First, groups often form\nbased on minor, even trivial, criteria. With sports afﬁliations, a random birthplace\nsuffices, and in business it is where you work. To test this, the British psychologist\nHenri Tajfel split strangers into groups, tossing a coin to choose who went to\nwhich group. He told the members of one group it was because they all liked a\nparticular type of art. The results were impressive: although A) they were\nstrangers, B) they were allocated a group at random and C) they were far from art\nconnoisseurs, the group members found each other more agreeable than\nmembers of other groups. Second, you perceive people outside your own group\nto be more similar than they actually are. This is called the \nout-group\nhomogeneity bias\n. Stereotypes and prejudices stem from it. Have you ever\nnoticed that, in science-ﬁction movies, only the humans have different cultures\nand the aliens do not? Third, since groups often form on the basis of common\nvalues, group members receive a disproportionate amount of support for their\nown views. This distortion is dangerous, especially in business: it leads to the\ninfamous organisational blindness.\nFamily members helping one another out is understandable. If you share half\nyour genes with your siblings, you are naturally interested in their well-being. But\nthere is such a thing as ‘pseudo-kinship’, which evokes the same emotions\nwithout blood relationship. Such feelings can lead to the most senseless\ncognitive error of all: laying down your life for a random group – also known as\ngoing to war. It is no coincidence that ‘motherland’ suggests kinship. And it’s not\nby chance that the goal of any military training is to forge soldiers together as\n‘brothers’.\nIn conclusion: prejudice and aversion are biological responses to anything\nforeign. Identifying with a group has been a survival strategy for hundreds of\nthousands of years. Not any longer; identifying with a group distorts your view of\nthe facts. Should you ever be sent to war, and you don’t agree with its goals,\ndesert.\nSee also \nSocial Proof\n (ch. 4); \nGroupthink\n (ch. 25)\n80\nTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RISK AND UNCERTAINTY\nAmbiguity Aversion\nTwo boxes. Box A contains 100 balls: 50 red and 50 black. Box B also holds 100\nballs, but you don’t know how many are red and how many black. If you reach\ninto one of the boxes without looking and draw out a red ball, you win $100.\nWhich box will you choose: A or B? The majority will opt for A.\nLet’s play again, using exactly the same boxes. This time, you win $100 if you\ndraw out a \nblack\n ball. Which box will you go for now? Most likely you’ll choose A\nagain. But that’s illogical! In the ﬁrst round, you assumed that B contained fewer\nred balls (and more black balls), so, rationally, you would have to opt for B this\ntime around.\nDon’t worry; you’re not alone in this error – quite the opposite. This result is\nknown as the \nEllsberg Paradox\n – named after Daniel Ellsberg, a former Harvard\npsychologist. (As a side note, he later leaked the top-secret Pentagon Papers to\nthe press, leading to the downfall of President Nixon.) The \nEllsberg Paradox\noffers empirical proof that we favour known probabilities (box A) over unknown\nones (box B).\nThus we come to the topics of risk and uncertainty (or ambiguity) and the\ndifference between them. Risk means that the probabilities are known.\nUncertainty means that the probabilities are unknown. On the basis of risk, you\ncan decide whether or not to take a gamble. In the realm of uncertainty, though,\nit’s much harder to make decisions. The terms risk and uncertainty are as\nfrequently mixed up as cappuccino and latte macchiato – with much graver\nconsequences. You can make calculations with risk, but not with uncertainty. The\n300-year-old science of risk is called statistics. A host of professors deal with it,\nbut not a single textbook exists on the subject of uncertainty. Because of this, we\ntry to squeeze ambiguity into risk categories, but it doesn’t really ﬁt. Let’s look at\ntwo examples: one from medicine (where it works) and one from the economy\n(where it does not).\nThere are billions of humans on earth. Our bodies do not differ dramatically. We\nall reach a similar height (no one will ever be 100 feet tall) and a similar age (no\none will live for 10,000 years – or for only a millisecond). Most of us have two\neyes, four heart valves, thirty-two teeth. Another species would consider us to be\nhomogeneous – as similar to each other as we consider mice to be. For this\nreason, there are many similar diseases and it makes sense to say, for example:\n‘There is a 30% risk you will die of cancer.’ On the other hand, the following\nassertion is meaningless: ‘There is a 30% chance that the euro will collapse in\nthe next ﬁve years.’ Why? The economy resides in the realm of uncertainty. There\nare not billions of comparable currencies from whose history we can derive\nprobabilities. The difference between risk and uncertainty also illustrates the\ndifference between life insurance and credit default swaps. A credit default swap\nis an insurance policy against speciﬁc defaults, a particular company’s inability to\npay. In the first case (life insurance), we are in the calculable domain of risk; in the\nsecond (credit default swap), we are dealing with uncertainty. This confusion\ncontributed to the chaos of the ﬁnancial crisis in 2008. If you hear phrases such\nas ‘the \nrisk\n of hyperinﬂation is x per cent’ or ‘the \nrisk\n to our equity position is y’,\nstart worrying.\nTo avoid hasty judgement, you must learn to tolerate ambiguity. This is a\ndifﬁcult task and one that you cannot inﬂuence actively. Your amygdala plays a\ncrucial role. This is a nut-sized area in the middle of the brain responsible for\nprocessing memory and emotions. Depending on how it is built, you will tolerate\nuncertainty with greater ease or difﬁculty. This is evident not least in your political\norientation: the more averse you are to uncertainty, the more conservatively you\nwill vote. Your political views have a partial biological underpinning.\nEither way, whoever hopes to think clearly must understand the difference\nbetween risk and uncertainty. Only in very few areas can we count on clear\nprobabilities: casinos, coin tosses and probability textbooks. Often we are left with\ntroublesome ambiguity. Learn to take it in stride.\nSee also \nBlack Swan\n (ch. 75);\n Neglect of Probability\n (ch. 26);\n Base-Rate Neglect\n (ch. 28);\nAvailability Bias\n (ch. 11);\n Alternative Paths\n (ch. 39)\n81\nWHY YOU GO WITH THE STATUS QUO\nDefault Effect\nIn a restaurant the other day I scanned the wine list in desperation. Irouléguy?\nHarslevelü? Susumaniello? I’m far from an expert, but I could tell that a\nsommelier was trying to prove his worldliness with these selections. On the last\npage, I found redemption: ‘Our French house wine: Réserve du Patron,\nBourgogne, $52’. I ordered it right away; it couldn’t be that bad, I reasoned.\nI’ve owned an iPhone for several years now. The gadget allows me to\ncustomise everything – data usage, app synchronisation, phone encryption, even\nhow loud I want the camera shutter to sound. How many of these have I set up so\nfar? You guessed it: not one.\nIn my defence, I’m not technically challenged. Rather, I’m just another victim of\nthe so-called \ndefault effect\n. The default setting is as warm and welcoming as a\nsoft pillow into which we happily collapse. Just as I tend to stick with the house\nwine and factory cellphone settings, most people cling to the standard options.\nFor example, new cars are often advertised in a certain colour; in every\ncatalogue, video and ad, you see the new car in the same colour, although the\ncar is available in a myriad of colours. The percentage of buyers who select this\ndefault colour far exceeds the percentage of car buyers who bought this particular\ncolour in the past. Many opt for the default.\nIn their book, \nNudge\n, economist Richard Thaler and law professor Cass\nSunstein illustrate how a government can direct its citizens without\nunconstitutionally restricting their freedom. The authorities simply need to provide\na few options – always including a default choice for indecisive individuals. This\nis how New Jersey and Pennsylvania presented two car-insurance policies to\ntheir inhabitants. The ﬁrst policy was cheaper but waived certain rights to\ncompensation should an accident take place. New Jersey advertised this as the\nstandard option and most people were happy to take it. In Pennsylvania,\nhowever, the second, more expensive option was touted as the standard and\npromptly became the best-seller. This outcome is quite remarkable, especially\nwhen you consider that the two states’ drivers cannot differ all that much in what\nthey want covered, nor in what they want to pay.\nOr consider this experiment: there is a shortage of organ donors. Only about\n40% of people opt for it. Scientists Eric Johnson and Dan Goldstein asked people\nwhether, in the event of death, they wanted to actively opt \nout\n of organ donation.\nMaking donation the default option increased take-up from 40% to more than 80%\nof participants, a huge difference between an opt-in and an opt-out default.\nThe \ndefault effect\n is at work even when no standard option is mentioned. In\nsuch cases we make our past the default setting, thereby prolonging and\nsanctifying the status quo. People crave what they know. Given the choice of\ntrying something new or sticking to the tried and tested option, we tend to be\nhighly conservative even if a change would be beneﬁcial. My bank, for example,\ncharges an annual fee of $60 for mailing out account statements. I could save\nmyself this amount if I downloaded the statements online. However, though the\npricey (and paper-guzzling) service has bothered me for years, I still can’t bring\nmyself to get rid of it once and for all.\nSo where does the \nstatus-quo bias \ncome from? In addition to sheer\nconvenience, \nloss aversion\n plays a role. Recall that losses upset us twice as\nmuch as similar gains please us. For this reason, tasks such as renegotiating\nexisting contracts prove very difﬁcult. Regardless of whether these are private or\nprofessional, each concession you make weighs twice as heavy as any you\nreceive, so such exchanges end up feeling like net losses.\nBoth the \ndefault effect\n and the \nstatus-quo bias\n reveal that we have a strong\ntendency to cling to the way things are, even if this puts us at a disadvantage. By\nchanging the default setting, you can change human behaviour.\n‘Maybe we live our lives according to some grand hidden default idea,’ I\nsuggested to a dinner companion, hoping to draw him into a deep philosophical\ndiscussion. ‘Maybe it just needs a little time to develop,’ he said after trying the\nRéserve du Patron.\nSee also \nDecision Fatigue\n (ch. 53);\n Paradox of Choice\n (ch. 21); \nLoss Aversion\n (ch. 32)\n82\nWHY ‘LAST CHANCES’ MAKE US PANIC\nFear of Regret\nTwo stories: Paul owns shares in company A. During the year, he considered\nselling them and buying shares in company B. In the end, he didn’t. Today he\nknows that if he had done so, he would have been up $1,200. Second story:\nGeorge had shares in company B. During the year, he sold them and bought\nshares in company A. Today he also knows that if he had stuck with B, he would\nhave netted an extra $1,200. Who feels more regret?\nRegret is the feeling of having made the wrong decision. You wish someone\nwould give you a second chance. When asked who would feel worse, 8% of\nrespondents said Paul, whereas 92% chose George. Why? Considered\nobjectively, the situations are identical. Both Paul and George were unlucky,\npicked the wrong stock, and were out of pocket by the exact same amount. The\nonly difference: Paul already possessed the shares in A, whereas George went\nout and bought them. Paul was passive, George, active. Paul embodies the\nmajority – most people leave their money lying where it is for years – and George\nrepresents the exception. It seems that whoever does not follow the crowd\nexperiences more regret.\nIt is not always the one who acts who feels more regret. Sometimes, choosing\nnot to act can constitute an exception. An example: a venerable publishing house\nstands alone in its refusal to publish trendy e-books. Books are made of paper,\nasserts the owner, and he will stick by this tradition. Shortly afterward, ten\npublishers go bankrupt. Nine of them attempted to launch e-book strategies and\nfaltered. The ﬁnal victim is the conventional paper-only publisher. Who will regret\nthe series of decisions most, and who will gain the most sympathy? Right: the\nstoic e-grumbler.\nHere is an example from Daniel Kahneman’s book \nThinking, Fast and Slow\n:\nafter every plane crash, we hear the story of one unlucky person who actually\nwanted to ﬂy a day earlier or later, but for some reason changed his booking at\nthe last minute. Since he is the exception, we feel more sympathy for him than for\nthe other ‘normal’ passengers who were booked on the ill-fated ﬂight from the\noutset.\nThe\n fear of regret\n can make us behave irrationally. To dodge the terrible feeling\nin the pits of our stomachs, we tend to act conservatively, so as not to deviate\nfrom the crowd too much. No one is immune to this, not even supremely self-\nconﬁdent traders. Statistics show that each year on December 31 (D-day for\nperformance reviews and bonus calculations), they tend to ofﬂoad their more\nexotic stocks and conform to the masses. Similarly, \nfear of regret\n (and the\nendowment effect\n) prevents you from throwing away things you no longer require.\nYou are afraid of the remorse you will feel in the unlikely event that you needed\nthose worn-out tennis shoes after all.\nThe\n fear of regret\n becomes really irksome when combined with a ‘last chance’\noffer. A safari brochure promises ‘the last chance to see a rhino before the\nspecies is extinct’. If you never cared about seeing one before today, why would\nyou fly all the way to Tanzania to do so now? It is irrational.\nLet’s say you have long dreamed of owning a house. Land is becoming scarce.\nOnly a handful of plots with lake views are left. Three remain, then two and now\njust one. It’s your last chance! This thought racing through your head, you give in\nand buy the last plot at an exorbitant price. The \nfear of regret\n tricked you into\nthinking this was a one-time offer, when in reality, real estate with a lake view will\nalways come on the market. The sale of stunning property isn’t going to stop any\ntime soon. ‘Last chances’ make us panic-stricken, and the \nfear of regret\n can\noverwhelm even the most hard-headed dealmakers.\nSee also \nScarcity Error\n (ch. 27);\n Endowment Effect\n (ch. 23);\n Alternative Paths\n (ch. 39);\nFraming\n (ch. 42)\n83\nHOW EYE-CATCHING DETAILS RENDER US BLIND\nSalience Effect\nImagine the issue of marijuana has been dominating the media for the past few\nmonths. Television shows portray potheads, clandestine growers and dealers.\nThe tabloid press prints photos of 12-year-old girls smoking joints. Broadsheets\nroll out the medical arguments and illuminate the societal, even philosophical\naspects of the substance. Marijuana is on everyone’s lips. Let’s assume for a\nmoment that smoking does not affect driving in any way. Just as anyone can wind\nup in an accident, a driver with a joint is also involved in a crash every now and\nthen – purely coincidentally.\nKurt is a local journalist. One evening, he happens to drive past the scene of an\naccident. A car is wrapped around a tree trunk. Since Kurt has a very good\nrelationship with the local police, he learns that they found marijuana in the back\nseat of the car. He hurries back to the newsroom and writes this headline:\n‘Marijuana Kills Yet Another Motorist’.\nAs stated above, we are assuming that the statistical relationship between\nmarijuana and car accidents is zero. Thus, Kurt’s headline is unfounded. He has\nfallen victim to the \nsalience effect\n. \nSalience\n refers to a prominent feature, a\nstandout attribute, a particularity, something that catches your eye. The \nsalience\neffect\n ensures that outstanding features receive much more attention than they\ndeserve. Since marijuana is the \nsalient\n feature of this accident, Kurt believes that\nit is responsible for the crash.\nA few years later, Kurt moves into business journalism. One of the largest\ncompanies in the world has just announced that it is promoting a woman to CEO.\nThis is big news! Kurt snaps open his laptop and begins to write his commentary:\nthe woman in question, he types, got the post simply because she is female. In\ntruth, the promotion probably had nothing to do with gender, especially since men\nﬁll most top positions. If it were so important to have women as leaders, other\ncompanies would have acted by now. But in this news story, gender is the \nsalient\nfeature and thus it earns undue weight.\nNot only journalists fall prey to the \nsalience effect. \nWe all do. Two men rob a\nbank and are arrested shortly after. It transpires that they are Nigerian. Although\nno ethnic group is responsible for a disproportionate number of bank robberies,\nthis \nsalient\n fact distorts our thinking. Lawless immigrants at it again, we think. If an\nArmenian commits rape, it is attributed to the ‘Armenians’ rather than other factors\nthat also exist among Americans. Thus, prejudices form. That the vast majority of\nimmigrants live lawful lives is easily forgotten. We always recall the undesirable\nexceptions – they are particularly \nsalient\n. Therefore, whenever immigrants are\ninvolved it is the striking, negative incidents that come to mind first.\nThe \nsalience effect\n inﬂuences not only how we interpret the past, but also how\nwe imagine the future. Daniel Kahneman and his fellow researcher Amos\nTversky found that we place unwarranted emphasis on \nsalient\n information when\nwe are forecasting. This explains why investors are more sensitive to sensational\nnews (i.e. the dismissal of a CEO) than they are to less striking information (such\nas the long-term growth of a company’s proﬁts). Even professional analysts\ncannot always evade the \nsalience effect\n.\nIn conclusion: \nsalient\n information has an undue inﬂuence on how you think and\nact. We tend to neglect hidden, slow-to-develop, discrete factors. Do not be\nblinded by irregularities. A book with an unusual, ﬁre-engine red jacket makes it\non to the bestseller list. Your ﬁrst instinct is to attribute the success of the book to\nthe memorable cover. Don’t. Gather enough mental energy to ﬁght against\nseemingly obvious explanations.\nSee also\n The Halo Effect\n (ch. 38);\n Primacy and Recency Effects \n(ch. 73);\n Confirmation\nBias\n (ch. 7–8);\n Induction\n (ch. 31);\n Fundamental Attribution Error\n (ch. 36);\n Affect\nHeuristic\n (ch. 66)\n84\nWHY MONEY IS NOT NAKED\nHouse-Money Effect\nA windy fall day in the early 1980s. The wet leaves swirled about the sidewalk.\nPushing my bike up the hill to school, I noticed a strange leaf at my feet. It was big\nand rust-brown, and only when I bent down did I realise it was a 500-Swiss-franc\nbill! That was the equivalent of about $250 back then, an absolute fortune for a\nhigh school student. The money spent little time in my pocket: I soon bought\nmyself to a top-of-the-range bike with disc brakes and Shimano gears, one of the\nbest models around. The funny thing was, my old bike worked fine.\nAdmittedly, I wasn’t completely broke back then: I had managed to save up a\nfew hundred francs through mowing grass in the neighbourhood. However, it\nnever crossed my mind to spend this hard-earned money on something so\nunnecessary. The most I treated myself to was a trip to the movies every now and\nthen. It was only upon reﬂection that I realised how irrational my behaviour had\nbeen. Money is money after all. But we don’t see it that way. Depending on how\nwe get it, we treat it differently. Money is not naked; it is wrapped in an emotional\nshroud.\nTwo questions. You’ve worked hard for a year. At the end of the twelve months,\nyou have $20,000 more in your account than you had at the beginning. What do\nyou do? A) Leave it sitting in the bank. B) Invest it. C) Use it to make necessary\nimprovements, such as renovating your mouldy kitchen or replacing old tyres. D)\nTreat yourself to a luxury cruise.\nIf you think like most people, you’ll opt for A, B or C.\nSecond question. You win $20,000 in the lottery. What do you do with it?\nChoose from A, B, C or D above. Most people now take C or D. And of course, by\ndoing so they exhibit ﬂawed thinking. You can count it any way you like; $20,000\nis still $20,000.\nWe witness similar delusions in casinos. A friend places $1,000 on the roulette\ntable – and loses everything. When asked about this, he says: ‘I didn’t really\ngamble away $1,000. I won all that earlier.’ ‘But it’s the same amount!’ ‘Not for\nme,’ he laughs.\nWe treat money that we win, discover or inherit much more frivolously than\nhard-earned cash. The economist Richard Thaler calls this the \nhouse-money\neffect\n. It leads us to take bigger risks and, for this reason, many lottery winners\nend up worse off after they’ve cashed in their winnings. That old platitude – win\nsome, lose some – is a feeble attempt to downplay real losses.\nThaler divided his students into two groups. The ﬁrst group learned they had\nwon $30 and could choose to take part in the following coin toss: if it was tails,\nthey would win $9. If heads, they would lose $9. Seventy per cent of students\nopted to risk it. The second group learned they had won nothing, but that they\ncould choose between receiving $30 or taking part in a coin toss in which heads\nwon them $21 and tails secured $39. The second group behaved more\nconservatively. Only 43% were prepared to gamble – even though the expected\nvalue for both options was the same: $30.\nMarketing strategists recognise the usefulness of the \nhouse-money effect\n.\nOnline gambling sites ‘reward’ you with $100 credit when you sign up. Credit\ncard companies offer the same when you ﬁll in the application form. Airlines\npresent you with a few thousand miles when you join their frequent ﬂyer clubs.\nPhone companies give you free call credit to get you accustomed to making lots\nof calls. A large part of the coupon craze stems from the \nhouse-money effect\n.\nIn conclusion: be careful if you win money or if a business gives you something\nfor free. Chances are you will pay it back with interest out of sheer exuberance.\nIt’s better to tear the provocative clothes from this seemingly free money. Put it in\nworkmen’s gear. Put it in your bank account or back into your own company.\nSee also \nEndowment Effect\n (ch. 23);\n Scarcity Error\n (ch. 27);\n Loss Aversion\n (ch. 32)\n85\nWHY NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTIONS DON’T WORK\nProcrastination\nA friend, a writer, someone who knows how to capture emotion in sentences –\nlet’s call him an artist – writes modest books of about 100 pages every seven\nyears. His output is the equivalent of two lines of print per day. When asked about\nhis miserable productivity, he says: ‘Researching is just so much more enjoyable\nthan writing.’ So, he sits at his desk, surfing the web for hours on end or immersed\nin the most abstruse books – all in the hope of hitting upon a magniﬁcent,\nforgotten story. Once he has found suitable inspiration, he convinces himself that\nthere is no point starting until he is in the ‘right mood’. Unfortunately, the right\nmood is a rare occurrence.\nAnother friend has tried to quit smoking every day for the past ten years. Each\ncigarette is his last. And me? My tax returns have been lying on my desk for six\nmonths, waiting to be completed. I haven’t yet given up hope that they will ﬁll\nthemselves in.\nProcrastination\n is the tendency to delay unpleasant but important acts: the\narduous trek to the gym, switching to a cheaper insurance policy, writing thank-\nyou letters. Even New Year’s resolutions won’t help you here.\nProcrastination\n is idiotic because no project completes itself. We know that\nthese tasks are beneﬁcial, so why do we keep pushing them on to the back\nburner? Because of the time lapse between sowing and reaping. To bridge it\nrequires a high degree of mental energy, as psychologist Roy Baumeister\ndemonstrated in a clever experiment. He put students in front of an oven in which\nchocolate cookies were baking. Their delicious scent wafted around the room. He\nthen placed a bowl ﬁlled with radishes by the oven and told the students that they\ncould eat as many of these as they wanted, but the cookies were strictly out of\nbounds. He then left the students alone in the room for thirty minutes. Students in\na second group were allowed to eat as many cookies as they wanted. Afterward,\nboth groups had to solve a tough maths problem. The students who were\nforbidden to eat any cookies gave up on the maths problem twice as fast as those\nwho were allowed to gorge freely on cookies. The period of self-control had\ndrained their mental energy – or willpower – which they now needed to solve the\nproblem. Willpower is like a battery, at least in the short term. If it is depleted,\nfuture challenges will falter.\nThis is a fundamental insight. Self-control is not available around the clock. It\nneeds time to refuel. The good news: to achieve this, all you need to do is reﬁll\nyour blood sugar and kick back and relax.\nThough eating enough and giving yourself breaks is important, the next\nnecessary condition is employing an array of tricks to keep you on the straight\nand narrow. This includes eliminating distractions. When I write a novel, I turn off\nmy Internet access. It’s just too enticing to go online when I reach a knotty part.\nThe most effective trick, however, is to set deadlines. Psychologist Dan Ariely\nfound that dates stipulated by external authorities – for example, a teacher or the\nIRS – work best. Self-imposed deadlines will work only if the task is broken down\nstep by step, with each part assigned its own due date. For this reason, nebulous\nNew Year’s resolutions are doomed to fail.\nSo get over yourself. \nProcrastination\n is irrational, but human. To ﬁght it, use a\ncombined approach. This is how my neighbour managed to write her doctoral\nthesis in three months: she rented a tiny room with neither telephone nor Internet\nconnection. She set three dates, one for each part of the paper. She told anyone\nwho would listen about these deadlines and even printed them on the back of her\nbusiness cards. This way, she transformed personal deadlines into public\ncommitments. At lunchtime and in the evenings, she refuelled her batteries by\nreading fashion magazines and sleeping a lot.\nSee also \nOmission Bias\n (ch. 44);\n Planning Fallacy\n (ch. 91);\n Action Bias\n (ch. 43);\nHyperbolic Discounting\n (ch. 51);\n Zeigarnik Effect\n (ch. 93)\n86\nBUILD YOUR OWN CASTLE\nEnvy\nThree scenarios – which would irk you the most? A) Your friends’ salaries\nincrease. Yours stays the same. B) Their salaries stay the same. Yours too. C)\nTheir average salaries are cut. Yours is, too.\nIf you answered A, don’t worry, that’s perfectly normal: you’re just another\nvictim of the green-eyed monster.\nHere is a Russian tale: a farmer ﬁnds a magic lamp. He rubs it, and out of thin\nair appears a genie, who promises to grant him one wish. The farmer thinks about\nthis for a little while. Finally, he says: ‘My neighbour has a cow and I have none. I\nhope that his drops dead.’\nAs absurd as it sounds, you can probably identify with the farmer. Admit it: a\nsimilar thought must have occurred to you at some point in your life. Imagine your\ncolleague scores a big bonus and you get a gift certiﬁcate. You feel \nenvy\n. This\ncreates a chain of irrational behaviour: you refuse to help him any longer,\nsabotage his plans, perhaps even puncture the tyres of his Porsche. And you\nsecretly rejoice when he breaks his leg skiing.\nOf all the emotions, \nenvy\n is the most idiotic. Why? Because it is relatively easy\nto switch off. This is in contrast to anger, sadness, or fear. ‘Envy is the most stupid\nof vices, for there is no single advantage to be gained from it,’ writes Balzac. In\nshort, envy is the most sincere type of flattery; other than that, it’s a waste of time.\nMany things spark \nenvy\n: ownership, status, health, youth, talent, popularity,\nbeauty. It is often confused with jealousy because the physical reactions are\nidentical. The difference: the subject of \nenvy\n is a thing (status, money, health etc.).\nThe subject of jealousy is the behaviour of a third person. \nEnvy\n needs two\npeople. Jealousy, on the other hand, requires three: Peter is jealous of Sam\nbecause the beautiful girl next door rings him instead.\nParadoxically, with envy we direct resentments toward those who are most\nsimilar to us in age, career and residence. We don’t envy businesspeople from\nthe century before last. We don’t begrudge plants or animals. We don’t envy\nmillionaires on the other side of the globe – just those on the other side of the city.\nAs a writer, I don’t envy musicians, managers or dentists, but other writers. As a\nCEO you envy other, bigger CEOs. As a supermodel you envy more successful\nsupermodels. Aristotle knew this: ‘Potters envy potters.’\nThis brings us to a classic practical error: let’s say your ﬁnancial success\nallows you to move from one of New York’s grittier neighbourhoods to\nManhattan’s Upper East Side. In the first few weeks, you enjoy being in the centre\nof everything and how impressed your friends are with your new apartment and\naddress. But soon you realise that apartments of completely different proportions\nsurround you. You have traded in your old peer group for one that is much richer.\nThings start to bother you that haven’t bothered you before. \nEnvy\n and status\nanxiety are the consequences.\nHow do you curb \nenvy\n? First, stop comparing yourself to others. Second, ﬁnd\nyour ‘circle of competence’ and ﬁll it on your own. Create a niche where you are\nthe best. It doesn’t matter how small your area of mastery is. The main thing is\nthat you are king of the castle.\nLike all emotions, \nenvy\n has its origins in our evolutionary past. If the hominid\nfrom the cave next door took a bigger share of the mammoth, it meant less for the\nloser. \nEnvy\n motivated us to do something about it. \nLaissez-faire\n hunter-gatherers\ndisappeared from the gene pool; in extreme cases, they died of starvation, while\nothers feasted. We are the offspring of the envious. But, in today’s world, \nenvy\n is\nno longer vital. If my neighbour buys himself a Porsche, it doesn’t mean that he\nhas taken anything from me.\nWhen I ﬁnd myself suffering pangs of \nenvy\n, my wife reminds me: ‘It’s OK to be\nenvious – but only of the person you aspire to become.’\nSee also \nSocial Comparison Bias\n (ch. 72);\n Hedonic Treadmill\n (ch. 46)\n87\nWHY YOU PREFER NOVELS TO STATISTICS\nPersonification\nFor eighteen years, the American media was prohibited from showing\nphotographs of fallen soldiers’ cofﬁns. In February 2009, defence secretary\nRobert Gates lifted this ban and images ﬂooded on to the Internet. Ofﬁcially,\nfamily members have to give their approval before anything is published, but such\na rule is unenforceable. Why was this ban created in the ﬁrst place? To conceal\nthe true costs of war. We can easily ﬁnd out the number of casualties, but\nstatistics leave us cold. People, on the other hand, especially dead people, spark\nan emotional reaction.\nWhy is this? For aeons, groups have been essential to our survival. Thus, over\nthe past 100,000 years, we have developed an impressive sense of how others\nthink and feel. Science calls this the ‘theory of mind’. Here’s an experiment to\nillustrate it: you are given $100 and must share it with a stranger. You can decide\nhow it is divided up. If the other person is happy with your suggestion, the money\nwill be divided that way. If he or she turns down your offer, you must return the\n$100, and no one gets anything. How do you split the sum?\nIt would make sense to offer the stranger very little – maybe just a dollar. After\nall, it’s better than nothing. However, in the 1980s, when economists began\nexperimenting with such ‘ultimatum games’ (the technical term), the subjects\nbehaved very differently: they offered the other party between 30% and 50%.\nAnything below 30% was considered ‘unfair’. The ultimatum game is one of the\nclearest manifestations of the ‘theory of mind’: in short, we empathise with the\nother person.\nHowever, with one tiny change it is possible to near-eliminate this compassion:\nput the players in separate rooms. When people can’t see their counterparts – or,\nindeed, when they have never seen them – it is more difﬁcult to simulate their\nfeelings. The other person becomes an abstraction, and the share they are\noffered drops, on average, to below 20%.\nIn another experiment, psychologist Paul Slovic asked people for donations.\nOne group was shown a photo of Rokia from Malawi, an emaciated child with\npleading eyes. Afterward, people donated an average of $2.83 to the charity (out\nof $5 they were given to ﬁll out a short survey). The second group was shown\nstatistics about the famine in Malawi, including the fact that more than three\nmillion malnourished children were affected. The average donation dropped by\n50%. This is illogical: you would think that people’s generosity would grow if they\nknew the extent of the disaster. But we do not function like that. Statistics don’t stir\nus; people do.\nThe media have long known that factual reports and bar charts do not entice\nreaders. Hence the guideline: give the story a face. If a company features in the\nnews, a picture of the CEO appears alongside (either grinning or grimacing,\ndepending on the market). If a state makes the headlines, the president\nrepresents it. If an earthquake takes place, a victim becomes the face of the crisis.\nThis obsession explains the success of a major cultural invention: the novel.\nThis literary ‘killer app’ projects personal and interpersonal conﬂicts on to a few\nindividual destinies. A scholar could have written a meaty dissertation about the\nmethods of psychological torture in Puritan New England, but instead, we still\nread Hawthorne’s \nThe Scarlet Letter\n. And the Great Depression? In statistical\nform, this is just a long series of numbers. As a family drama, in Steinbeck’s \nThe\nGrapes of Wrath\n, it is unforgettable.\nIn conclusion: be careful when you encounter human stories. Ask for the facts\nand the statistical distribution behind them. You can still be moved by the story,\nbut this way, you can put it into the right context. If, however, you seek to move\nand motivate people for your own ends, make sure your tale is seasoned with\nnames and faces.\nSee also \nStory Bias\n (ch. 13);\n News Illusion\n (ch. 99);\n Linking Bias\n (ch. 22)\n88\nYOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU ARE OVERLOOKING\nIllusion of Attention\nAfter heavy rains in the south of England, a river in a small village overﬂowed its\nbanks. The police closed the ford, the shallow part of the river where vehicles\ncross, and diverted trafﬁc. The crossing stayed closed for two weeks, but each\nday at least one car drove past the warning sign and into the rushing water. The\ndrivers were so focused on their car’s navigation systems that they didn’t notice\nwhat was right in front of them.\nIn the 1990s, Harvard psychologists Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris\nﬁlmed two teams of students passing basketballs back and forth. One team wore\nblack T-shirts, the other white. The short clip, ‘The Monkey Business Illusion’, is\navailable on YouTube. (Take a look before reading on.) In the video, viewers are\nasked to count how many times the players in white T-shirts pass the ball. Both\nteams move in circles, weaving in and out, passing back and forth. Suddenly, in\nthe middle of the video, something bizarre happens: a student dressed as a\ngorilla walks into the centre of the room, pounds his chest and promptly\ndisappears again. At the end, you are asked if you noticed anything unusual. Half\nthe viewers shake their heads in astonishment. Gorilla? What gorilla?\nThe monkey business test is considered one of the most famous experiments\nin psychology and demonstrates the so-called \nillusion\n \nof attention\n: we are\nconfident that we notice everything that takes place in front of us. But in reality, we\noften see only what we are focusing on – in this case, the passes made by the\nteam in white. Unexpected, unnoticed interruptions can be as large and\nconspicuous as a gorilla.\nThe \nillusion\n \nof attention\n can be precarious, for example, when making a phone\ncall while driving. Most of the time doing so poses no problems. The call does not\nnegatively inﬂuence the straightforward task of keeping the car in the middle of\nthe lane and braking when a car in front does. But as soon as an unanticipated\nevent takes place, such as a child running across the street, your attention is too\nstretched to react in time. Studies show that drivers’ reactions are equally slow\nwhen using a cellphone as when under the inﬂuence of alcohol or drugs.\nFurthermore, it does not matter whether you hold the phone with one hand, jam it\nbetween your shoulder and jaw, or use a hands-free kit: your responsiveness to\nunexpected events is still compromised.\nPerhaps you know the expression ‘the elephant in the room’. It refers to an\nobvious subject that nobody wants to discuss. A kind of taboo. In contrast, let us\ndeﬁne what ‘the gorilla in the room’ is: a topic that is of the utmost importance and\nurgency, and that we absolutely need to address, but nobody knows about it.\nTake the case of Swissair, a company that was so ﬁxated on expansion that it\noverlooked its evaporating liquidity and went bankrupt in 2001. Or the\nmismanagement in the Eastern bloc that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Or the\nrisks on banks’ books that up until 2007 nobody paid any attention to. Such\ngorillas stomp around right in front of us – and we barely spot them.\nIt’s not the case that we miss every extraordinary event. The crux of the matter\nis that whatever we fail to notice remains unheeded. Therefore, we have no idea\nwhat we are overlooking. This is exactly why we still cling to the dangerous\nillusion that we perceive everything of importance.\nPurge yourself of the \nillusion\n \nof attention\n every now and then. Confront all\npossible and seemingly impossible scenarios. What unexpected events might\nhappen? What lurks beside and behind the burning issues? What is no one\naddressing? Pay attention to silences as much as you respond to noises. Check\nthe periphery, not just the centre. Think the unthinkable. Something unusual can\nbe huge; we still may not see it. Being big and distinctive is not enough to be\nseen. The unusual and huge thing must be expected.\nSee also \nFeature-Positive Effect\n (ch. 95);\n Confirmation Bias \n(chs. 7–8);\n Availability Bias\n(ch. 11);\n Primacy and Recency Effects\n (ch. 73)\n89\nHOT AIR\nStrategic Misrepresentation\nSuppose you apply for your dream job. You buff your resumé to a shine. In the job\ninterview, you highlight your achievements and abilities and gloss over weak\npoints and setbacks. When they ask if you could boost sales by 30% while cutting\ncosts by 30%, you reply in a calm voice: ‘Consider it done.’ Even though you are\ntrembling inside and racking your brain about how the hell you are going to pull\nthat off, you do and say whatever is necessary to get the job. You concentrate on\nwowing the interviewers; the details will follow. You know that if you give even\nsemi-realistic answers, you’ll put yourself out of the race.\nImagine you are a journalist and have a great idea for a book. The issue is on\neveryone’s lips. You ﬁnd a publisher who is willing to pay a nice advance.\nHowever, he needs to know your timeline. He removes his glasses and looks at\nyou: ‘When can I expect the manuscript? Can you have it ready in six months?’\nYou gulp. You’ve never written a book in under three years. Your answer:\n‘Consider it done.’ Of course you don’t want to lie, but you know that you won’t\nget the advance if you tell the truth. Once the contract is signed and the money is\nnestling in your bank account, you can always keep the publisher at bay for a\nwhile. You’re a writer; you’re great at making up stories!\nThe ofﬁcial term for such behaviour is \nstrategic misrepresentation\n:\n \nthe more at\nstake, the more exaggerated your assertions become. \nStrategic\nmisrepresentation\n does not work everywhere. If your ophthalmologist promises\nﬁve times in a row to give you perfect vision, but after each procedure you see\nworse than before, you will stop taking him seriously at some point. However,\nwhen unique attempts are involved, \nstrategic misrepresentation\n is worth a try – in\ninterviews, for example, as we saw above. A single company isn’t going to hire\nyou several times. It’s either a yes or no.\nMost vulnerable to \nstrategic misrepresentation\n are mega-projects, where A)\naccountability is diffuse (for example, if the government that commissioned the\nproject is no longer in power), B) many businesses are involved, leading to\nmutual finger-pointing, or C) the end date is a few years down the road.\nNo one knows more about large-scale projects than Oxford professor Bent\nFlyvbjerg. Why are cost and schedule overruns so frequent? Because it is not the\nbest offer overall that wins; it is whichever one looks best on paper. Flyvbjerg\ncalls this ‘reverse Darwinism’: whoever produces the most hot air will be\nrewarded with the project. However, is \nstrategic misrepresentation\n simply brazen\ndeceit? Yes and no. Are women who wear make-up frauds? Are men who lease\nPorsches to signal ﬁnancial prowess liars? Yes and no. Objectively they are, but\nthe deceit is socially acceptable, so we don’t get worked up about it. The same\ncounts for \nstrategic misrepresentation.\nIn many cases, \nstrategic misrepresentation\n is harmless. However, for the things\nthat matter, such as your health or future employees, you must be on your guard.\nSo, if you are dealing with a person (a ﬁrst-rate candidate, an author or an\nophthalmologist), don’t go by what they claim; look at their past performance.\nWhen it comes to projects, consider the timeline, beneﬁts and costs of similar\nprojects, and grill anyone whose proposals are much more optimistic. Ask an\naccountant to pick apart the plans mercilessly. Add a clause into the contract that\nstipulates harsh ﬁnancial penalties for cost and schedule overruns. And, as an\nadded safety measure, have this money transferred to a secure escrow account.\nSee also \nOverconfidence Effect\n (ch. 15)\n90\nWHERE’S THE OFF SWITCH?\nOverthinking\nThere was once an intelligent centipede. Sitting on the edge of a table, he looked\nover and saw a tasty grain of sugar across the room. Clever as he was, he started\nto weigh up the best route: which table leg should he crawl down – left or right –\nand which table leg should he crawl up? The next tasks were to decide which\nfoot should take the ﬁrst step, in which order the others should follow, and so on.\nHe was adept at mathematics, so he analysed all the variants and selected the\nbest path. Finally, he took the ﬁrst step. However, still engrossed in calculation\nand contemplation, he got tangled up and stopped dead in his tracks to review his\nplan. In the end, he came no further and starved.\nThe British Open golf tournament in 1999: French golfer Jean Van de Velde\nplayed ﬂawlessly until the ﬁnal hole. With a three-shot lead, he could easily afford\na double-bogey (two over par) and still win. Child’s play! Entry into the big\nleagues was now only a matter of minutes away. All he needed to do was to play\nit safe. But as Van de Velde stepped up, beads of sweat began to form on his\nforehead. He teed off like a beginner. The ball sailed into the bushes, landing\nalmost twenty feet from the hole. He became increasingly nervous. The next\nshots were no better. He hit the ball into knee-high grass, then into the water. He\ntook off his shoes, waded into the water and for a minute contemplated shooting\nfrom the pond. But he decided to take the penalty. He then shot into the sand. His\nbody movements suddenly resembled those of a novice. Finally, he made it onto\nthe green and – after a seventh attempt – into the hole. Van de Velde lost the\nBritish Open and secured a place in sporting history with his now-notorious triple-\nbogey.\nIn the 1980s, \nConsumer Reports\n asked experienced tasters to sample forty-ﬁve\ndifferent varieties of strawberry jelly. A few years later, psychology professors\nTimothy Wilson and Jonathan Schooler repeated the experiment with students\nfrom the University of Washington. The results were almost identical. Both\nstudents and experts preferred the same type. But that was only the ﬁrst part of\nWilson’s experiment. He repeated it with a second group of students who, unlike\nthe ﬁrst group, had to ﬁll in a questionnaire justifying their ratings in detail. The\nrankings turned out to be completely warped. Some of the best varieties ended up\nat the bottom of the rankings.\nEssentially, if you think too much, you cut off your mind from the wisdom of your\nfeelings. This may sound a little esoteric – and a bit surprising coming from\nsomeone like me who strives to rid my thinking of irrationality – but it is not.\nEmotions form in the brain, just as crystal-clear, rational thoughts do. They are\nmerely a different form of information processing – more primordial, but not\nnecessarily an inferior variant. In fact, sometimes they provide the wiser counsel.\nThis raises the question: when do you listen to your head and when do you\nheed your gut? A rule of thumb might be: if it is something to do with practised\nactivities, such as motor skills (think of the centipede, Van de Velde or mastering\na musical instrument), or questions you’ve answered a thousand times (think of\nWarren Buffett’s ‘circle of competence’), it’s better not to reﬂect to the last detail. It\nundermines your intuitive ability to solve problems. The same applies to\ndecisions that our Stone Age ancestors faced – evaluating what was edible, who\nwould make good friends, whom to trust. For such purposes, we have \nheuristics\n,\nmental shortcuts that are clearly superior to rational thought. With complex\nmatters, though, such as investment decisions, sober reﬂection is indispensable.\nEvolution has not equipped us for such considerations, so logic trumps intuition.\nSee also \nAction Bias\n (ch. 43);\n Information Bias\n (ch. 59)\n91\nWHY YOU TAKE ON TOO MUCH\nPlanning Fallacy\nEvery morning, you compile a to-do list. How often does it happen that everything\nis checked off by the end of the day? Always? Every other day? Maybe once a\nweek? If you are like most people, you will achieve this rare state once a month.\nIn other words, you systematically take on too much. More than that: your plans\nare absurdly ambitious. Such a thing would be forgivable if you were a planning\nnovice. But you’ve been compiling to-do lists for years, if not decades. Thus, you\nknow your capabilities inside out and it’s unlikely that you overestimate them\nafresh every day. This is not facetiousness: in other areas, you learn from\nexperience. So why is there no learning curve when it comes to making plans?\nEven though you realise that most of your previous endeavours were overly\noptimistic, you believe in all seriousness that, today, the same workload – or more\n– is eminently doable. Daniel Kahneman calls this the \nplanning fallacy\n.\nIn their last semesters, students generally have to write theses. The Canadian\npsychologist Roger Buehler and his research team asked the following of their\nﬁnal-year class. The students had to specify two submission dates: the ﬁrst was a\n‘realistic’ deadline and the second was a ‘worst-case scenario’ date. The result?\nOnly 30% of students made the realistic deadlines. On average, the students\nneeded 50% more time than planned – and a full seven days more than their\nworst-case scenario date.\nThe \nplanning fallacy\n is particularly evident when people work together – in\nbusiness, science and politics. Groups overestimate duration and beneﬁts and\nsystematically underestimate costs and risks. The conch-shaped Sydney Opera\nHouse was planned in 1957: completion was due in 1963 at a cost of $7 million. It\nﬁnally opened its doors in 1973 after $102 million had been pumped in – 14 times\nthe original estimate!\nSo why are we not natural-born planners? The ﬁrst reason: wishful thinking.\nWe want to be successful and achieve everything we take on. Second, we focus\ntoo much on the project and overlook outside inﬂuences. Unexpected events too\noften scupper our plans. This is true for daily schedules, too: your daughter\nswallows a ﬁsh bone. Your car battery gives up the ghost. An offer for a house\nlands on your desk and must be discussed urgently. There goes the plan. If you\nplanned things even more minutely, would that be a solution? No, step-by-step\npreparation ampliﬁes the \nplanning fallacy\n. It narrows your focus even more and\nthus distracts you even more from anticipating the unexpected.\nSo what can you do? Shift your focus from internal things, such as your own\nproject, to external factors, like similar projects. Look at the base rate and consult\nthe past. If other ventures of the same type lasted three years and devoured $5\nmillion, this will probably apply to your project, too – no matter how carefully you\nplan. And, most importantly, shortly before decisions are made, perform a so-\ncalled ‘premortem’ session (literally, ‘before death’). The American psychologist\nGary Klein recommends delivering this short speech to the assembled team:\n‘Imagine it is a year from today. We have followed the plan to the letter. The result\nis a disaster. Take ﬁve or ten minutes to write about this disaster.’ The stories will\nshow you how things might turn out.\nSee also \nProcrastination\n (ch. 85);\n Forecast Illusion\n (ch. 40);\n Zeigarnik Effect\n (ch. 93);\nGroupthink\n (ch. 25)\n92\nTHOSE WIELDING HAMMERS SEE ONLY NAILS\nDéformation Professionnelle\nA man takes out a loan, starts a company, and goes bankrupt shortly afterward.\nHe falls into a depression and commits suicide.\nWhat do you make of this story? As a business analyst, you want to understand\nwhy the business idea did not work: was he a bad leader? Was the strategy\nwrong, the market too small or the competition too large? As a marketer, you\nimagine the campaigns were poorly organised, or that he failed to reach his target\naudience. If you are a ﬁnancial expert, you ask whether the loan was the right\nﬁnancial instrument. As a local journalist, you realise the potential of the story:\nhow lucky that he killed himself! As a writer, you think about how the incident\ncould develop into a kind of Greek tragedy. As a banker, you believe an error took\nplace in the loan department. As a socialist, you blame the failure of capitalism.\nAs a religious conservative, you see in this a punishment from God. As a\npsychiatrist, you recognise low serotonin levels. Which is the ‘correct’ viewpoint?\nNone of them. ‘If\nyour only tool is a hammer, all your problems will be nails,’\nsaid Mark Twain – a quote that sums up the \ndéformation professionnelle\n. Charlie\nMunger, Warren Buffett’s business partner, named the effect the \nman with the\nhammer tendency \nafter Twain: ‘But that’s a perfectly disastrous way to think and a\nperfectly disastrous way to operate in the world. So you’ve got to have multiple\nmodels. And the models have to come from multiple disciplines – because all the\nwisdom of the world is not to be found in one little academic department.’\nHere are a few examples of \ndéformation professionnelle\n: surgeons want to\nsolve almost every medical problem with a scalpel, even if their patients could be\ntreated with less invasive methods. Armies think of military solutions ﬁrst.\nEngineers, structural. Trend gurus see trends in everything (incidentally, this is\none of the most idiotic ways to view the world). In short: if you ask someone the\ncrux of a particular problem, they usually link it to their own area of expertise.\nSo what’s wrong with that? It’s good if, say, a tailor sticks to what he knows.\nThe \ndéformation professionnelle\n becomes hazardous when people apply their\nspecialised processes in areas where they don’t belong. Surely you’ve come\nacross some of these: teachers who scold their friends like students. New\nmothers who begin to treat their husbands like children. Or consider the\nomnipresent Excel spreadsheet that is featured on every computer: we use them\neven when it makes no sense – for example, when generating ten-year ﬁnancial\nprojections for start-ups or when comparing potential lovers we have ‘sourced’\nfrom dating sites. Excel spreadsheets might well be one of the most dangerous\nrecent inventions.\nEven in his own jurisdiction, the \nman with the hammer\n tends to overuse it.\nLiterary reviewers are trained to detect authors’ references, symbols and hidden\nmessages. As a novelist, I realise that literary reviewers conjure up such devices\nwhere there are none. This is not a million miles away from what business\njournalists do. They scour the most trivial utterings of central bank governors and\nsomehow discover hints of fiscal policy change by parsing their words.\nIn conclusion: if you take your problem to an expert, don’t expect the overall\nbest solution. Expect an approach that can be solved with the expert’s toolkit. The\nbrain is not a central computer. Rather, it is a Swiss Army knife with many\nspecialised tools. Unfortunately, our ‘pocketknives’ are incomplete. Given our life\nexperiences and our professional expertise, we already possess a few blades.\nBut to better equip ourselves, we must try to add two or three additional tools to\nour repertoire – mental models that are far aﬁeld from our areas of expertise. For\nexample, over the past few years, I have begun to take a biological view of the\nworld and have won a new understanding of complex systems. Locate your\nshortcomings and ﬁnd suitable knowledge and methodologies to balance them. It\ntakes about a year to internalise the most important ideas of a new ﬁeld, and it’s\nworth it: your pocketknife will be bigger and more versatile, and your thoughts\nsharper.\nSee also \nVolunteer’s Folly\n (ch. 65);\n Domain Dependence\n (ch. 76);\n Gambler’s Fallacy\n(ch. 29)\n93\nMISSION ACCOMPLISHED\nZeigarnik Effect\nBerlin, 1927: a group of university students and professors visit a restaurant. The\nwaiter takes order upon order, including special requests, but does not bother to\nwrite anything down. This is going to end badly, they think. But, after a short wait,\nall diners receive exactly what they ordered. After dinner, outside on the street,\nRussian psychology student Bluma Zeigarnik notices that she has left her scarf\nbehind in the restaurant. She goes back in, ﬁnds the waiter with the incredible\nmemory and asks him if he has seen it. He stares at her blankly. He has no idea\nwho she is or where she sat. ‘How can you have forgotten?’ she asks indignantly.\n‘Especially with your super memory!’ The waiter replies curtly: ‘I keep every order\nin my head – until it is served.’\nZeigarnik and her mentor Kurt Lewin studied this strange behaviour and found\nthat all people function more or less like the waiter. We seldom forget\nuncompleted tasks; they persist in our consciousness and do not let up, tugging\nat us like little children, until we give them our attention. On the other hand, once\nwe’ve completed a task and checked it off our mental list, it is erased from\nmemory.\nThe researcher has lent her name to this: scientists now speak of the \nZeigarnik\neffect\n. However, in her investigation she uncovered a few untidy outliers: some\npeople kept a completely clear head even if they had dozens of projects on the\ngo. Only in recent years could Roy Baumeister and his research team at Florida\nState University shed light on this. He took students who were a few months\naway from their ﬁnal examinations, and split them into three groups. Group 1 had\nto focus on a party during the current semester. Group 2 had to concentrate on the\nexam. Group 3 had to focus on the exam and also create a detailed study plan.\nThen Baumeister asked students to complete words under time pressure. Some\nstudents saw ‘pa—’ and ﬁlled in ‘panic’, while others thought of ‘party’ or ‘Paris’.\nThis was a clever method of ﬁnding out what was on each of their minds. As\nexpected, group 1 had relaxed about the upcoming exam, while students in group\n2 could think of nothing else. Most astonishing was the result from group 3.\nAlthough these students also had to focus on the upcoming exam, their minds\nwere clear and free from anxiety. Further experiments conﬁrmed this. Outstanding\ntasks gnaw at us only until we have a clear idea of how we will deal with them.\nZeigarnik mistakenly believed that it was necessary to complete tasks to erase\nthem from memory. But it’s not; a good plan of action suffices.\nDavid Allen, the author of a best-selling book aptly entitled \nGetting\n \nThings\nDone\n, argues that he has one goal: to have a head as clear as water. For this,\nyou don’t need to have your whole life sorted into tidy compartments. But it does\nmean that you need a detailed plan for dealing with the messier areas. This plan\nmust be divided into step-by-step tasks and preferably written down. Only when\nthis is done can your mind rest. The adjective ‘detailed’ is important. ‘Organise\nmy wife’s birthday party’ or ‘ﬁnd a new job’ are worthless. Allen forces his clients\nto split such projects into twenty to fifty individual tasks.\nIt’s worth noting that Allen’s recommendation seems to ﬂy in the face of the\nplanning fallacy\n (chapter 91): the more detailed our planning, the more we tend to\noverlook factors from the periphery that will derail our projects. But here is the rub:\nif you want peace of mind, go for Allen’s approach. If you want the most accurate\nestimate on cost, beneﬁt, and duration of a project, forget your detailed plan and\nlook up similar projects. If you want both, do both.\nFortunately, you can do all this yourself with the aid of a decidedly low-tech\ndevice. Place a notepad by your bed. The next time you cannot get to sleep, jot\ndown outstanding tasks and how you will tackle them. This will silence the\ncacophony of inner voices. ‘You want to ﬁnd God, but you’re out of cat food, so\ncreate a plan to deal with it,’ says Allen. His advice is sound, even if you have\nalready found God or have no cat.\nSee also \nProcrastination\n (ch. 85);\n Planning Fallacy\n (ch. 91)\n94\nTHE BOAT MATTERS MORE THAN THE ROWING\nIllusion of Skill\nWhy are there so few serial entrepreneurs – businesspeople who start successful\ncompanies one after the other? Of course, there’s Steve Jobs and Richard\nBranson, but they represent a tiny minority. Serial entrepreneurs account for less\nthan one per cent of everyone who starts a company. Do they all retire to their\nprivate yachts after the ﬁrst success just like Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen did?\nSurely not. True business people possess too much get-up-and-go to lie on a\nbeach chair for hours on end. Is it because they can’t let go and want to cosset\ntheir ﬁrms until they turn 65? No. Most founders sell their shares within ten years.\nActually, you would assume that such self-starters who are blessed with talent, a\ngood personal network and a solid reputation would be well equipped to found\nnumerous other start-ups. So why do they stop? They didn’t stop. They just failed\nat succeeding. Only one answer makes sense: luck plays a bigger role than skill\ndoes. No businessperson likes to hear this. When I first heard about the \nillusion of\nskill\n, my reaction was: ‘What, my success was a ﬂuke?’ At ﬁrst, it sounds a little\noffensive, especially if you worked hard to get there.\nLet’s take a sober look at business success. How much of it comes down to\nluck, and how much is the fruit of hard work and distinct talent? The question is\neasily misunderstood. Of course, little is achieved without talent, and nothing is\nachieved without hard work. Unfortunately, neither skills nor toil and trouble are\nthe key criteria for success. They are \nnecessary – \nbut not sufﬁcient. How do we\nknow this? There is a very simple test: when a person is successful for a long\ntime – more than that, when they enjoy more success in the long run compared to\nless qualiﬁed people – then and only then is talent the essential element. This is\nnot the case with company founders; otherwise, the majority of successful\nentrepreneurs would, after the ﬁrst achievement, continue to found and grow\nsecond, third and fourth start-ups.\nWhat about corporate leaders? How important are they to the success of a\ncompany? Researchers determined a set of traits deemed to be associated with\n‘a strong CEO’ – management procedures, strategic brilliance in the past etc.\nThen they measured the relationship between these behaviours on one hand,\nand the increase of the companies’ values during the reign of these CEOs on the\nother hand. The result: if you compare two companies at random, in 60% of cases\nthe stronger CEO leads the stronger company. In 40% of the cases, the weaker\nCEO leads the stronger company. This is only 10 percentage points more than no\nrelationship at all. Kahneman said: ‘It’s hard to imagine that people\nenthusiastically buy books written by business leaders who are, on average, only\nslightly better than the norm.’ Even Warren Buffett thinks nothing of CEO\ndeification: ‘[?. . .?] A\ngood managerial record [?. . .?] is far more a function of what\nbusiness boat you get into than it is of how effectively you row.’\nIn certain areas, skill plays no role whatsoever. In his book \nThinking\n, \nFast and\nSlow\n, Kahneman describes his visit to an asset management company. To brief\nhim, they sent him a spreadsheet showing the performance of each investment\nadviser over the past eight years. From this, a ranking was assigned to each:\nnumber 1, 2, 3 and so on in descending order. This was compiled every year.\nKahneman quickly calculated the relationship between the years’ rankings.\nSpeciﬁcally, he calculated the correlation of the rankings between year 1 and\nyear 2, between year 1 and year 3, year 1 and year 4, up until year 7 and year 8.\nThe result: pure coincidence. Sometimes the adviser was at the very top and\nsometimes the very bottom. If an adviser had a great year, this was neither\nbolstered by previous years nor carried into subsequent years. The correlation\nwas zero. And yet the consultants pocketed bonuses for their performance. In\nother words, the company was rewarding luck rather than skill.\nIn conclusion: certain people make a living from their abilities, such as pilots,\nplumbers and lawyers. In other areas, skill is necessary but not critical, as with\nentrepreneurs and leaders. Finally, chance is the deciding factor in a number of\nﬁelds, such as in ﬁnancial markets. Here, the \nillusion of skill \npervades. So: give\nplumbers due respect and chuckle at successful financial jesters.\nSee also \nBeginner’s Luck\n (ch. 49);\n Survivorship Bias\n (ch. 1);\n Authority Bias \n(ch. 9);\nOverconfidence Effect \n(ch. 15);\n Illusion of Control \n(ch. 17);\n Outcome Bias \n(ch. 20)\n95\nWHY CHECKLISTS DECEIVE YOU\nFeature-Positive Effect\nTwo series of numbers: the ﬁrst, series A, consists of: 724, 947, 421, 843, 394,\n411, 054, 646. What do these numbers have in common? Don’t read on until you\nhave an answer. It’s simpler than you think: the number four features in each of\nthem. Now examine series B: 349, 851, 274, 905, 772, 032, 854, 113. What links\nthese numbers? Do not read further until you’ve ﬁgured it out. Series B is more\ndifﬁcult, right? Answer: none use the number six. What can you learn from this?\nAbsence is much harder to detect than presence. In other words, we place greater\nemphasis on what is present than on what is absent.\nLast week, while on a walk, it occurred to me that nothing hurt. It was an\nunexpected thought. I rarely experience pain anyway, but when I do, it is very\npresent. But the absence of pain I rarely recognise. It was such a simple, obvious\nfact, it amazed me. For a moment, I was elated – until this little revelation slipped\nfrom my mind again.\nAt a classical recital, an orchestra performed Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony. A\nstorm of enthusiasm gripped the concert hall. During the ode in the fourth\nmovement, tears of joy could be seen here and there. How fortunate we are that\nthis symphony exists, I thought. But is that really true? Would we be less happy\nwithout the work? Probably not. Had the symphony never been composed, no\none would miss it. The director would receive no angry calls saying: ‘Please have\nthis symphony written and performed immediately.’ In short, what exists means a\nlot more than what is missing. Science calls this the \nfeature-positive effect\n.\nPrevention campaigns utilise this well. ‘Smoking causes lung cancer’ is much\nmore powerful than ‘Not smoking leads to a life free of lung cancer.’ Auditors and\nother professionals who employ checklists are prone to the \nfeature-positive effect\n:\noutstanding tax declarations are immediately obvious because they feature on\ntheir lists. What does not appear, however, is more artistic fraud, such as the\ngoings-on at Enron and with Bernie Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. Also absent are the\nundertakings of ‘rogue traders’, such as Nick Leeson and Jerome Kerviel, to\nwhom Barings and Société Générale fell victim. Financial vagaries of this kind\nare not on any checklist. And they do not have to be illegal: a mortgage bank will\nbe on the lookout for credit risk due to a drop in the debtor’s income because this\nappears on its list; however it will overlook the devaluation of property, say,\nthrough the construction of an incineration plant in the vicinity.\nSuppose you manufacture a dubious product, such as a salad dressing with a\nhigh level of cholesterol. What do you do? On the label, you promote the twenty\ndifferent vitamins in the dressing and omit the cholesterol level. Consumers won’t\nnotice its absence. And the positive, present features will make sure that they feel\nsafe and informed.\nIn academia, we constantly encounter the \nfeature-positive effect\n. The\nconﬁrmation of hypotheses leads to publications and, in exceptional cases, these\nare rewarded with Nobel prizes. On the other hand, the falsiﬁcation of a\nhypothesis is a lot harder to get published, and as far as I know there has never\nbeen a Nobel Prize awarded for this. However, such falsiﬁcation is as\nscientiﬁcally valuable as conﬁrmation. Another consequence of the effect is that\nwe are also much more open to positive advice (do X) than to negative\nsuggestions (forget about Y) – no matter how useful the latter may be.\nIn conclusion: we have problems perceiving non-events. We are blind to what\ndoes not exist. We realise if there is a war, but we do not appreciate the absence\nof war during peacetime. If we are healthy, we rarely think about being sick. Or, if\nwe get off the plane in Cancun, we do not stop to notice that we did not crash. If\nwe thought more frequently about absence, we might well be happier. But it is\ntough mental work. The greatest philosophical question is why does something\nand not \nnothing\n exist? Don’t expect a quick answer; rather, the question itself\nrepresents a useful instrument for combating the \nfeature-positive effect\n.\nSee also \nForer Effect\n (ch. 64);\n Confirmation Bias \n(chs. 7-8); \nSelf-Selection Bias\n (ch. 47);\nAvailability Bias \n(ch. 11);\n Illusion of Attention \n(ch. 88)\n96\nDRAWING THE BULL’S-EYE AROUND THE ARROW\nCherry-picking\nOn their websites, hotels present themselves in the very best light. They carefully\nselect each photo, and only beautiful, majestic images make the cut. Unﬂattering\nangles, dripping pipes and drab breakfast rooms are swept under the tattered\ncarpet. Of course, you know this is true. When you are confronted by the shabby\nlobby for the ﬁrst time, you simply shrug your shoulders and head to the\nregistration desk.\nWhat the hotel did is called \ncherry-picking\n: selecting and showcasing the most\nattractive features and hiding the rest. As with the hotel experience, you approach\nother things with the same muted expectations: brochures for cars, real estate or\nlaw firms. You know how they work and you don’t fall for them.\nHowever, you respond differently to the annual reports of companies,\nfoundations and government organisations. Here, you tend to expect objective\ndepictions. You are mistaken. These bodies also \ncherry-pick\n: if goals are\nachieved, they are talked up; if they falter, they are not even mentioned.\nSuppose you are the head of a department. The board invites you to present\nyour team’s state of play. How do you tackle this? You devote most of your\nPowerPoint slides to elaborate on the team’s triumphs and throw in a token few to\nidentify ‘challenges’. Any other unmet achievements you conveniently forget.\nAnecdotes are a particularly tricky sort of \ncherry-picking\n. Imagine you are the\nmanaging director of a company that manufactures some kind of technical device.\nA survey has revealed that the vast majority of customers cannot operate your\ngadget. It’s too complicated. Now the HR manager gives his two cents,\nproclaiming: ‘My father-in-law picked it up yesterday and ﬁgured out how to work\nit straight away.’ How much weight would you attach to this particular cherry?\nRight: close to zero. To rebuff an anecdote is difﬁcult because it is a mini-story,\nand we know how vulnerable our brains are to those. To prevent this, cunning\nleaders train themselves throughout their careers to be hypersensitive to such\nanecdotes and to shoot them down as soon as they are uttered.\nThe more elevated or elite a ﬁeld is, the more we fall for \ncherry-picking\n. In\nAntifragile\n, Taleb describes how all areas of research – from philosophy to\nmedicine to economics – brag about their results: ‘Like politicians, academia is\nwell equipped to tell us what it did for us, not what it did not – hence it shows how\nindispensable her methods are.’ Pure \ncherry-picking\n. But our respect for\nacademics is far too great for us to notice this.\nOr consider the medical profession. To tell people that they should not smoke\nis the greatest medical contribution of the past sixty years – superior to all the\nresearch and medical advances since the end of the Second World War.\nPhysician Druin Burch conﬁrms this in his book \nTaking the Medicine\n. A few\ncherries – antibiotics, for instance – distract us, and so, drug researchers are\ncelebrated while anti-smoking activists are not.\nAdministrative departments in large companies glorify themselves like hoteliers\ndo. They are masters at showcasing all they have done, but they never\ncommunicate what they haven’t achieved for the company. What should you do?\nIf you sit on the supervisory board of such an organisation, ask about the ‘leftover\ncherries’, the failed projects and missed goals. You learn a lot more from this than\nfrom the successes. It is amazing how seldom such questions are asked. Second:\ninstead of employing a horde of ﬁnancial controllers to calculate costs to the\nnearest cent, double-check targets. You will be amazed to ﬁnd that, over time, the\noriginal goals have faded. These have been replaced, quietly and secretly, with\nself-set goals that are always attainable. If you hear of such targets, alarm bells\nshould sound. It is the equivalent of shooting an arrow and drawing a bull’s-eye\naround where it lands.\nSee also \nStory Bias\n (ch. 13);\n Self-Serving Bias\n (ch. 45)\n97\nTHE STONE-AGE HUNT FOR SCAPEGOATS\nFallacy of the Single Cause\nChris Matthews is one of MSNBC’s top journalists. In his news show, so-called\npolitical experts are wheeled on one after the other and interviewed. I’ve never\nunderstood what a political expert is, or why such a career is worthwhile. In 2003,\nthe U.S. invasion of Iraq was the issue on everybody’s lips. More important than\nthe experts’ answers were Chris Matthews’ questions: ‘What is \nthe\n \nmotive\n behind\nthe war?’ ‘I wanted to know whether 9/11 is \nthe reason\n, because a lot of people\nthink it’s payback?’ ‘Do you think that the weapons of mass destruction were \nthe\nreason\n for this war?’ ‘Why do you think we invaded Iraq? The \nreal reason\n, not the\nsales pitch?’ And so on.\nI can’t abide questions like that any more. They are symptomatic of the most\ncommon of all mental errors, a mistake for which, strangely enough, there is no\neveryday term. For now, the awkward phrase, the \nfallacy of the single cause\n, will\nhave to do.\nFive years later, in 2008, panic reigned in the financial markets. Banks caved in\nand had to be nursed back to health with tax dollars. Investors, politicians and\njournalists probed furiously for the root of the crisis: Greenspan’s loose monetary\npolicy? The stupidity of investors? The dubious rating agencies? Corrupt\nauditors? Bad risk models? Pure greed? Not a single one, and yet every one of\nthese, is the cause.\nA balmy Indian summer, a friend’s divorce, the First World War, cancer, a\nschool shooting, the worldwide success of a company, the invention of writing –\nany clear-thinking person knows that no single factor leads to such events.\nRather, there are hundreds, thousands, an inﬁnite number of factors that add up.\nStill, we keep trying to pin the blame on just one.\n‘When an apple ripens and falls – what makes it fall? Is it that it is attracted to\nthe ground, is it that the stem withers, is it that the sun has dried it up, that is has\ngrown heavier, that the wind shakes it, that the boy standing underneath it wants\nto eat it? No one thing is the cause.’ In this passage from \nWar and Peace\n, Tolstoy\nhit the nail on the head.\nSuppose you are the product manager for a well-known breakfast cereal brand.\nYou have just launched an organic, low-sugar variety.

Take a sheet of\npaper and sketch out all the potential reasons. Do the same for the reasons\nbehind these reasons. After a while, you will have a network of possible\ninﬂuencing factors. Second, highlight those you can change and delete those you\ncannot (such as ‘human nature’). Third, conduct empirical tests by varying the\nhighlighted factors in different markets. This costs time and money, but it’s the\nonly way to escape the swamp of superficial assumptions.\nThe \nfallacy of the single cause\n is as ancient as it is dangerous. We have\nlearned to see people as the ‘masters of their own destinies’. Aristotle proclaimed\nthis 2,500 years ago. Today we know that it is wrong. The notion of free will is up\nfor debate. Our actions are brought about by the interaction of thousands of\nfactors – from genetic predisposition to upbringing, from education to the\nconcentration of hormones between individual brain cells. Still we hold ﬁrmly to\nthe old image of self-governance. This is not only wrong but also morally\nquestionable. As long as we believe in singular reasons, we will always be able\nto trace triumphs or disasters back to individuals and stamp them ‘responsible’.\nThe idiotic hunt for a scapegoat goes hand-in-hand with the exercise of power – a\ngame that people have been playing for thousands of years.\nAnd yet, the \nfallacy of the single cause\n is so popular that Tracy Chapman was\nable to build her worldwide success on it. ‘Give Me One Reason’ is the song that\nsecured her success. But hold on – weren’t there a few others, too?\nSee also \n‘Because’\n \nJustification\n (ch. 52);\n Falsification of History\n (ch. 78);\n Hindsight Bias\n(ch. 14);\n Fundamental Attribution Error\n (ch. 36)\n98\nSPEED DEMONS MAKE SAFE DRIVERS\nIntention-To-Treat Error\nYou’ll ﬁnd it hard to believe, but speed demons drive more safely than so-called\n‘careful’ drivers. Why? Well, consider this: the distance from Miami to West Palm\nBeach is around 75 miles. Drivers who cover the distance in an hour or less we’ll\ncategorise as ‘reckless drivers’ because they’re travelling at an average of 75\nmph or more. All others we put into the group of careful drivers. Which group\nexperiences fewer accidents? Without a doubt, it is the ‘reckless drivers’. They all\ncompleted the journey in less than an hour, so could not have been involved in\nany accidents. This automatically puts all drivers who end up in accidents in the\nslower drivers’ category. This example illustrates a treacherous fallacy, the so-\ncalled \nintention-to-treat error\n. Unfortunately, there is no catchier term for it.\nThis might sound to you like the \nsurvivorship bias\n (chapter 1), but it’s different.\nIn the \nsurvivorship bias\n you only see the survivors, not the failed projects or cars\ninvolved in accidents. In the \nintention-to-treat error\n, the failed projects or cars with\naccidents show up prominently, just in the wrong category.\nA banker showed me an interesting study recently. Its conclusion: companies\nwith debt on their balance sheets are signiﬁcantly more proﬁtable than ﬁrms with\nno debt (equity only). The banker vehemently insisted that every company should\nborrow at will, and, of course, his bank is the best place to do it. I examined the\nstudy more closely. How could that be? Indeed, from 1,000 randomly selected\nﬁrms, those with large loans displayed higher returns not only on their equity but\nalso on their total capital. They were in every respect more successful than the\nindependently ﬁnanced ﬁrms. Then the penny dropped: unproﬁtable companies\ndon’t get corporate loans. Thus, they form part of the ‘equity-only’ group. The firms\nthat make up this set have bigger cash cushions, stay aﬂoat longer and, no matter\nhow sickly they are, remain part of the study. On the other side, ﬁrms that have\nborrowed a lot go bankrupt more quickly. Once they cannot pay back the interest,\nthe bank takes over, and the companies are sold off – thus disappearing from the\nsample. The ones that remain in the ‘debt group’ are relatively healthy, regardless\nof how much debt they have amassed on their balance sheets.\nIf you’re thinking, ‘OK, got it’, watch out. The \nintention-to-treat error\n is not easy\nto recognise. A ﬁctional example from medicine: a pharmaceutical company has\ndeveloped a new drug to ﬁght heart disease. A study ‘proves’ that it signiﬁcantly\nreduces patients’ mortality rates. The data speaks for itself: among patients who\nhave taken the drug regularly, the ﬁve-year mortality rate is 15%. For those who\nhave swallowed placebo pills, it is about the same, indicating that the pill doesn’t\nwork. However – and this is crucial – the mortality rate of patients who have taken\nthe drug at irregular intervals is 30% – twice as high! A big difference between\nregular and irregular intake. So, the pill is a complete success. Or is it?\nHere’s the snag: the pill is probably not the decisive factor; rather, it is the\npatients’ behaviour. Perhaps patients discontinued the pill following severe side\neffects and so landed in the ‘irregular intake’ category. Maybe they were so ill that\nthere was no way to continue it on a regular basis. Either way, only relatively\nhealthy patients remain in the ‘regular’ group, which makes the drug look a lot\nmore effective than it really is. The really sick patients who, for this very reason,\ncouldn’t take the drug on a regular basis, ended up populating the ‘irregular\nintake’ group.\nIn reputable studies, medical researchers evaluate the data of all patients\nwhom they originally intend to treat (hence the title); it doesn’t matter if they take\npart in the trial or drop out. Unfortunately, many studies ﬂout this rule. Whether\nthis is intentional or accidental remains to be seen. Therefore, be on your guard:\nalways check whether test subjects – drivers who end up in accidents, bankrupt\ncompanies, critically ill patients – have, for whatever reason, vanished from the\nsample. If so, you should file the study where it belongs: in the trashcan.\nSee also \nSurvivorship Bias\n (ch. 1);\n Will Rogers Phenomenon\n (ch. 58)\n99\nWHY YOU SHOULDN’T READ THE NEWS\nNews Illusion\nEarthquake in Sumatra. Plane crash in Russia. Man holds daughter captive in\ncellar for thirty years. Heidi Klum separates from Seal. Record salaries at Bank of\nAmerica. Attack in Pakistan. Resignation of Mali’s president. New world record in\nshot-put.\nDo you really need to know all these things?\nWe are incredibly well informed yet we know incredibly little. Why? Because\ntwo centuries ago, we invented a toxic form of knowledge called ‘news’. News is\nto the mind what sugar is to the body: appetising, easy to digest – and highly\ndestructive in the long run.\nThree years ago, I began an experiment. I stopped reading and listening to the\nnews. I cancelled all newspaper and magazine subscriptions. Television and\nradio were disposed of. I deleted the news apps from my iPhone. I didn’t touch a\nsingle free newspaper and deliberately looked the other way when someone on a\nplane tried to offer me any such reading material. The ﬁrst weeks were hard. Very\nhard. I was constantly afraid of missing something. But after a while, I had a new\noutlook. The result after three years: clearer thoughts, more valuable insights,\nbetter decisions, and much more time. And the best thing? I haven’t missed\nanything important. My social network – not Facebook, the one that exists in the\nreal world consisting of ﬂesh-and-blood friends and acquaintances – works as a\nnews filter and keeps me in the loop.\nA dozen reasons exist to give news a wide berth. Here are the top three. First,\nour brains react disproportionately to different types of information. Scandalous,\nshocking, people-based, loud, fast-changing details all stimulate us, whereas\nabstract, complex and unprocessed information sedates us. News producers\ncapitalise on this. Gripping stories, garish images and sensational ‘facts’ capture\nour attention. Recall for a moment their business models: advertisers buy space\nand thus ﬁnance the news circus on the condition that their ads will be seen. The\nresult: everything subtle, complex, abstract and profound must be systematically\nﬁltered out, even though such stories are much more relevant to our lives and to\nour understanding of the world. As a result of news consumption, we walk around\nwith a distorted mental map of the risks and threats we actually face.\nSecond, news is irrelevant. In the past twelve months, you have probably\nconsumed about 10,000 news snippets – perhaps as many as thirty per day. Be\nvery honest: name one of them, just one, that helped you make a better decision –\nfor your life, your career or your business – compared with not having this piece of\nnews. No one I have asked has been able to name more than two useful news\nstories – out of 10,000. A miserable result. News organisations assert that their\ninformation gives you a competitive advantage. Too many fall for this. In reality,\nnews consumption represents a competitive disadvantage. If news really helped\npeople advance, journalists would be at the top of the income pyramid. They\naren’t – quite the opposite.\nThird, news is a waste of time. An average human being squanders half a day\neach week on reading about current affairs. In global terms, this is an immense\nloss of productivity. Take the 2008 terror attacks in Mumbai. Out of sheer thirst for\nrecognition, terrorists murdered 200 people. Let’s say a billion people devoted an\nhour of their time to following the aftermath: they viewed the minute-by-minute\nupdates and listened to the inane chatter of a few ‘experts’ and ‘commentators’.\nThis is a very realistic ‘guesstimate’ since India has more than a billion\ninhabitants. Thus our conservative calculation: one billion people multiplied by an\nhour’s distraction equals one billion hours of work stoppage. If we convert this, we\nlearn that news consumption wasted around 2,000 lives – ten times more than the\nattack. A sarcastic but accurate observation.\nI would predict that turning your back on news will beneﬁt you as much as\npurging any of the other ninety-eight ﬂaws we have covered in the pages of this\nbook. Kick the habit – completely. Instead, read long background articles and\nbooks. Yes, nothing beats books for understanding the world.\nSee also \nFundamental Attribution Error\n (ch. 36); \nSleeper Effect\n (ch. 70);\n Confirmation\nBias \n(ch. 7–8);\n Information Bias \n(ch. 59);\n Personification \n(ch. 87);\n Story Bias\n (ch. 13)\nEPILOGUE\n \nThe Pope asked Michelangelo: ‘Tell\nme the secret of your genius. How have you\ncreated the statue of David, the masterpiece of all masterpieces?’ Michelangelo’s\nanswer: ‘It’s simple. I removed everything that is not David.’\nLet’s be honest. We don’t know for sure what makes us successful. We can’t\npinpoint exactly what makes us happy. But we know with certainty what destroys\nsuccess or happiness. This realisation, as simple as it is, is fundamental:\nNegative knowledge (what \nnot \nto do) is much more potent than positive\nknowledge (what to do).\nThinking more clearly and acting more shrewdly means adopting\nMichelangelo’s method: don’t focus on David. Instead, focus on everything that is\nnot David and chisel it away. In our case: eliminate all errors and better thinking\nwill follow.\nThe Greeks, Romans and medieval thinkers had a term for this approach: \nvia\nnegativa\n. Literally the negative path, the path of renunciation, of exclusion, of\nreduction. Theologians were the ﬁrst to tread the \nvia negativa\n: we cannot say\nwhat God is; we can only say what God is not. Applied to the present day: we\ncannot say what brings us success. We can pin down only what blocks or\nobliterates success. Eliminate the downside, the thinking errors, and the upside\nwill take care of itself. This is all we need to know.\nAs a novelist and company founder, I have fallen into a variety of traps.\nFortunately I was always able to free myself from them. Nowadays when I hold\npresentations in front of doctors, CEOs, board members, investors, politicians or\ngovernment ofﬁcials, I sense a kinship. I feel that we are sitting in the same boat –\nafter all, we are all trying to row through life without getting swallowed up by the\nmaelstroms. Still, many people are uneasy with the \nvia negativa\n. It is counter-\nintuitive. It is even countercultural, ﬂying in the face of contemporary wisdom. But\nlook around and you’ll ﬁnd plenty of examples of the \nvia negativa\n at work. This is\nwhat the legendary investor Warren Buffett writes about himself and his partner\nCharlie Munger: ‘Charlie\nand I have not learned how to solve difﬁcult business\nproblems. What we have learned is to avoid them.’ Welcome to the \nvia negativa\n.\nI have listed almost 100 thinking errors in this book without answering the\nquestion: what are thinking errors anyway? What is irrationality? Why do we fall\ninto these traps? Two theories of irrationality exist: a \nhot\n and a \ncold\n. The \nhot\ntheory is as old as the hills. Here is Plato’s analogy: a rider steers wildly galloping\nhorses; the rider signiﬁes reason and the galloping horses embody emotions.\nReason tames feelings. If this fails, irrationality runs free. Another example:\nfeelings are like bubbling lava. Usually, reason can keep a lid on them, but every\nnow and then the lava of irrationality erupts. Hence \nhot\n irrationality. There is no\nreason to fret about logic: it is error-free; it’s just that, sometimes, emotions\noverpower it.\nThis hot theory of irrationality boiled and bubbled for centuries. For John\nCalvin, the founder of a strict form of Protestantism in the 1500s, such feelings\nrepresented evil, and only by focusing on God could you repel them. People who\nunderwent volcanic eruptions of emotion were of the devil. They were tortured\nand killed. According to Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud’s theory, the\nrationalist ‘ego’ and the moralistic ‘superego’ control the impulsive ‘id’. But that\ntheory holds less water in the real world. Forget about obligation and discipline.\nTo believe that we can completely control our emotions through thinking is\nillusory – as illusory as trying to make your hair grow by willing it to.\nOn the other hand, the \ncold\n theory of irrationality is still young. After the Second\nWorld War, many searched for explanations about the irrationality of the Nazis.\nEmotional outbursts were rare in Hitler’s leadership ranks. Even his ﬁery\nspeeches were nothing more than masterful performances. It was not molten\neruptions but stone-cold calculation that resulted in the Nazi madness. The same\ncan be said of Stalin or of the Khmer Rouge.\nIn the 1960s, psychologists began to do away with Freud’s claims and to\nexamine our thinking, decisions, and actions scientiﬁcally. The result was a cold\ntheory of irrationality that states: thinking is in itself not pure, but prone to error.\nThis affects everyone. Even highly intelligent people fall into the same cognitive\ntraps. Likewise, errors are not randomly distributed. We systematically err in the\nsame direction. That makes our mistakes predictable, and thus ﬁxable to a\ndegree – but only to a degree, never completely. For a few decades, the origins of\nthese errors remained in the dark. Everything else in our body is relatively reliable\n– heart, muscles, lungs, immune system. Why should our brains of all things\nexperience lapse after lapse?\nThinking is a biological phenomenon. Evolution has shaped it just as it has the\nforms of animals or the colours of ﬂowers. Suppose we could go back 50,000\nyears, grab hold of an ancestor and bring him back with us into the present. We\nsend him to the hairdresser and put him in a Hugo Boss suit. Would he stand out\non the street? No. Of course, he would have to learn English, how to drive and\nhow to operate a cellphone, but we had to learn those things, too. Biology has\ndispelled all doubt: physically, and that includes cognitively, we are hunter-\ngatherers in Hugo Boss (or H&M, as the case may be).\nWhat has changed markedly since ancient times is the environment in which\nwe live. Back then, things were simple and stable. We lived in small groups of\nabout ﬁfty people. There was no signiﬁcant technological or social progress. Only\nin the last 10,000 years did the world begin to transform dramatically, with the\ndevelopment of crops, livestock, villages, cities, global trade and ﬁnancial\nmarkets. Since industrialisation, little is left of the environment for which our brain\nis optimised. If you spend ﬁfteen minutes in a shopping mall, you will pass more\npeople than our ancestors saw during their entire lifetimes. Whoever claims to\nknow how the world will look in ten years is made into a laughing stock less than\na year after such a pronouncement. In the past 10,000 years, we have created a\nworld that we no longer understand. Everything is more sophisticated, but also\nmore complex and interdependent. The result is overwhelming material\nprosperity, but also lifestyle diseases (such as type two diabetes, lung cancer and\ndepression) and errors in thinking. If the complexity continues to rise – and it will,\nthat much is certain – these errors will only increase and intensify.\nIn our hunter-gatherer past, activity paid off more often than reﬂection did.\nLightning-fast reactions were vital and long ruminations were ruinous. If your\nhunter-gatherer buddies suddenly bolted, it made sense to follow suit –\nregardless of whether a sabre-tooth tiger or a boar had startled them. If you failed\nto run away, and it turned out to be a tiger, the price of a ﬁrst-degree error was\ndeath. On the other hand, if you had just ﬂed from a boar, this lesser mistake\nwould have only cost you a few calories. It paid to be wrong about the same\nthings. Whoever was wired differently exited the gene pool after the ﬁrst or\nsecond incidence. We are the descendants of those \nhomines sapientes\n who tend\nto scarper when the crowd does. But in the modern world, this intuitive behaviour\nis disadvantageous. Today’s world rewards single-minded contemplation and\nindependent action. Anyone who has fallen victim to stock market hype has\nwitnessed that.\nEvolutionary psychology is still mostly a theory, but a very convincing one. It\nexplains the majority of ﬂaws, though not all of them. Consider the following\nstatement: ‘Every Hershey bar comes in a brown wrapper. Thus, every candy bar\nin a brown wrapper must be a Hershey bar.’ Even intelligent people are\nsusceptible to this ﬂawed conclusion – so are native tribes that, for the most part,\nremain untouched by civilisation. Our hunter-gatherer ancestors were certainly\nnot impervious to faulty logic. Some bugs in our thinking are hard-wired and have\nnothing to do with the ‘mutation’ of our environment.\nWhy is that? Evolution does not ‘optimise’ us completely. As long as we\nadvance beyond our competitors (i.e., beat the Neanderthals), we can get away\nwith error-laced behaviour. Consider the cuckoo. For hundreds of thousands of\nyears, they have laid their eggs in the nests of songbirds, which then incubate\nand even feed the cuckoo chicks. This represents a behavioural error that\nevolution has not erased from the smaller birds; it is not deemed to be serious\nenough.\nA second, parallel explanation of why our mistakes are so persistent took\nshape in the late 1990s. Our brains are designed to reproduce rather than search\nfor the truth. In other words, we use our thoughts primarily to persuade. Whoever\nconvinces others secures power and thus access to resources. Such assets\nrepresent a major advantage for mating and for rearing offspring. That truth is, at\nbest, a secondary focus is reﬂected in the book market: novels sell much better\nthan non-fiction titles, in spite of the latter’s superior candour.\nFinally, a third explanation exists. Intuitive decisions, even if they lack logic, are\nbetter under certain circumstances. So-called heuristic research deals with this\ntopic. For many decisions, we lack the necessary information, so we are forced to\nuse mental shortcuts and rules of thumb (heuristics). If you are drawn to different\npotential romantic partners, you must evaluate whom to marry. This is not a\nrational decision; if you rely solely on logic, you will remain single forever. In\nshort, we often decide intuitively and justify our choices later. Many decisions\n(career, life partner, investments) take place subconsciously. A fraction of a\nsecond later, we construct a reason so that we feel we made a conscious choice.\nAlas, we do not behave like scientists, who are purely interested in objective\nfacts. Instead, we think like lawyers, crafting the best possible justiﬁcation for a\npredetermined conclusion.\nSo, forget about the ‘left and right brain’ that semi-intelligent self-help books\ndescribe. Much more important is the difference between intuitive and rational\nthinking. Both have legitimate applications. The intuitive mind is swift,\nspontaneous, and energy-saving. Rational thinking is slow, demanding, and\nenergy-guzzling (in the form of blood sugar). Nobody has described this better\nthan the great Daniel Kahneman in \nThinking, Fast and Slow\n.\nSince I started to collect cognitive errors, people often ask me how I manage to\nlive an error-free life. The answer is: I don’t. In fact, I don’t even try. Just like\neverybody else I make snap decisions by consulting not my thoughts, but my\nfeelings. For the most part I substitute the question, ‘What do I think about this?’\nwith ‘How do I feel about this?’ Quite frankly, anticipating and avoiding fallacies is\na costly undertaking.\nTo make things simple, I have set myself the following rules: in situations\nwhere the possible consequences are large (i.e. important personal or business\ndecisions), I try to be as reasonable and rational as possible when choosing. I\ntake out my list of errors, and check them off one by one, just like a pilot does. I’ve\ncreated a handy checklist decision tree, and I use it to examine important\ndecisions with a ﬁne-tooth comb. In situations where the consequences are small\n(i.e. regular or diet Pepsi, sparkling or ﬂat water?) I forget about rational\noptimisation and let my intuition take over. Thinking is tiring. Therefore, if the\npotential harm is small, don’t rack your brains; such errors won’t do lasting\ndamage. You’ll live better like this. Nature doesn’t seem to mind if our decisions\nare perfect or not, as long as we can manoeuvre ourselves through life – and as\nlong as we are ready to be rational when it comes to the crunch. And there’s one\nother area where I let my intuition take the lead: when I am in my \ncircle of\ncompetence\n. If you practise an instrument, you learn the notes and tell your\nﬁngers how to play them. Over time, you know the keys or the strings inside out.\nYou see a musical score and your hands play the notes almost automatically.\nWarren Buffett reads balance sheets like professional musicians read scores.\nThis is his \ncircle of competence\n, the ﬁeld he intuitively understands and masters.\nSo, ﬁnd out where your circle of competence is. Get a clear grasp of it. Hint: it’s\nsmaller than you think. If you face a consequential decision outside that circle,\napply the hard, slow, rational thinking. For everything else, give your intuition free\nrein.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThanks to my friend Nassim Nicholas Taleb for inspiring me to write this book,\neven if his advice was not to publish it under any circumstances.
