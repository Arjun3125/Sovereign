ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
First I would like to thank Anna Biller, who helped edit and research this book, and whose in­
valuable insights played a critical role in the shape and content of The 48 Laws. Without her,
none of this would have been possible.
I must also thank my dear friend Michiel Schwarz who was responsible for involving me in
the art school Fabrika in Italy and introducing me there toJ oost Elffers, my partner and producer
of The 48 Laws ofPower.1t was in the scheming world ofFabrika thatJoost and I saw the timeless­
ness of Machiavelli and from our discussions in Venice, Italy, this book was born.
I would like to thank Renri Le Goubin, who supplied me with many Machiavellian anec­
dotes over the years, particularly conceming the numerous French characters who play such a
large role in this book.
I would also like to thank Les and Sumiko Biller, who lent me their library on Japanese his­
tory and helped me with the Japanese Tea Ceremony part of the book. Similarly, I must thank
my good friend Elizabeth Yang who advised me on Chinese history.
A book like this depended greatly on the research material available and I am particularly
gratenIl to the UCLA Research Library; I spent many pleasant days wandering through its in­
comparable collections.
My parents, Laurette and Stanley Green, des erve endless thanks for their patience and
support.
And I must not forget to pay tribute to my cat, Boris, who kept me company throughout the
never-ending days of writing.
Finally, to those people in my life who have so skillfully used the game of power to manipu­
late, torture, and cause me pain over the years, I bear you no grudges and I thank you for sup­
plying me with inspiration for The 48 Laws ofPower.

CONTENTS
PREFACE page xvii
LAW 1 page 1
NEVER OUTSHINE THE MASTER
Always make those above you feel comfortably superior. In your desire to please or impress them, do not go
too far in displaying your talents or you might accomplish the opop site-inspire fear and insecurity. Make
your masters appear more brilliant than they are and you will attain the heights of power.
LAW 2 page 8
NEVER PUT TOO MUCH TRUST IN FRIENDS,
LEARN HOW TO USE ENEMIES
Be wary of fiei nds-they will betray you more quickly, for they are easily aroused to envy. They also become
spoiled and tyrannical. But hire a former enemy and he will be more loyal than a friend, because he has more
to prove. In fact, you have more to fear from fiiends than from enemies. If you have no enemies, find a way to
make them.
LAW 3 page 16
CONCEAL YOUR INTENTIONS
Keep people off-balance and in the dark lly never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no
clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defense. Guide them far enough down the wrang path, envelop
them in enough smoke, and lly the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late.
LAW 4 page 31
ALWAYS SAY LESS THAN NECESSARY
When you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less
in control. Even if you are saying something banal, it will seem original if you make it vague, open-ended,
and sphinxlike. Powerful people impress and intimidate lly saying less. The more you say, the more likely you
are to say somethingfoolish.
LAW 5 page 37
SO MUCH DEPENDS ON REPUTATION-GUARD IT WITH YOUR LIFE
Reputation is the corners tone of power. Through reputation alone you can intimidate and win; once it slips,
however, you are vulnerable, and will be attacked on all sides. Make your reputation unassailable. Always be
alert to potential attacks and thwart them before they happen. Meanwhile, leam to destroy your enemies lly
opening holes in their own reputations. Then stand aside and Let public opinion hang them.
LAW 6 page44
COURT ATTENTION AT ALL COST
Everything is judged lly its appearance; what is unseen counts for nothing. Never Let yourself get lost in the
crowd, then, or buried in oblivion. Stand out. Be conspicuous, at all cost. Make yourselfa magnet of attention
lrj appearing larger, more colorful, more mysterious than the bland and timid masses.

[PAGE 11]
LAW 7 page 56
GET OTHERS TO DO THE WORK FOR YOU, BUT ALWAYS TAKE THE CREDIT
Use the wisdom, knowledge, and legwork of other people to furtker your own cause. Not only will such assis­
tance save you valuable time and energy, it will give you a godlike aura of efcfi iency and speed. In the end
your helpers will be forgotten and you will be remembered. Never do yourself what others can do for you.
LAW S page 62
MAKE OTHER PEOPLE COME TO YOU-USE BAIT IF NECESSARY
When you force the other person to act, you are the one in control. It is always better to make your opponent
come to you, abandoning his own plans in the process. Lure him with fabulous gains-then attack. You hold
the cards.
LAW<) page69
WIN THROUGH YOUR ACTIONS, NEVER THROUGH ARGUMENT
Any momentary triumph you think you have gained through argument is really a Pyrrhic victory: The resent­
ment and ill will you stir up is stronger and !asts longer than any momentary change of opinion. It is much
more powerful to get others to agree with you through your actions, without saying a word. Demonstrate, do
not explicate.
LAW 10 page 76
INFECTION: AVOID THE UNHAPPY AND UNLUCKY
You can die from someone eises misery-emotional states are as infectious as diseases. You may feel you are
helping the drowning man but you are only precipitating your own disaster. The unfortunate sometimes draw
misfortune on themselves; they will also draw it on you. Associate with the happy and fortunate instead.
LA W 1 1 page 82
LEARN TO KEEP PEOPLE DEPENDENT ON YOU
To maintain your independence you must always be needed and wanted. The more you are relied on, the more
freedom you have. Make people depend on you for their happiness and prosperity and you have nothing to fear.
Never teach them enough so that they can do without you.
LA W I 2 page 89
USE SELECTIVE HONESTY AND GENEROSITY TO DISARM YOUR VICTIM
One sincere and honest move will cover over dozens of dishonest ones. open-hearted gestures of honesty and
generosity bring down the guard of even the most suspicious people. Once your selective honesty opens a hole in
their armor, you can deceive and manipulate them at will. A timely gift-a Trojan horse-will serve the same
pur pose.
LA W 1.1 page 95
WHEN ASKING FOR HELP, APPEAL TO PEOPLE'S SELF-INTEREST,
NEVER TO THEIR MERCY OR GRATITUDE
If you need to turn to an ally for help, do not bother to remind him of your past assistance and good deeds. He
will find a way to ignore you. Instead, uncover something in your request, or in your alliance with him, that
will benefit him, and emphasize it out of all proportion. He will resp ond enthusiastically when he sees some­
thing to be gained for himself.

LAW 14 page 101
POSE AS A FRIEND, WORK AS A SPY
Knowing about your rival is critical. Use spies to gather valuable information that will keep you a step ahead.
Better still: Play the spy yourself. In polite social encounters, leam to probe. Ask indireet questions to get people
to reveal their weaknesses and intentions. There is no occasion that is not an opportunity for artjul spying.
LAW 15 page 107
CRUSH YOUR ENEMY TOTALLY
All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they
have leamed this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventu­
ally break out. More is lost through stopipng halfway than through total annihilation: The enemy will recover,
and will seek revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.
LAW 16 page 115
USE ABSENCE TO INCREASE RESPECT AND HONOR
Too much circulation makes the price go down: The more you are seen and heard from, the more common you
appear. If you are already established in a group, temporary withdrawal from it will make you more talked
about, even more admired. You must leam when to leave. Create value through scarcity.
LA W 17 page 123
KEEP OTHERS IN SUSPENDED TERROR: CULTIVATE AN AIR OF UNPREDlCTABILlTY
Humans are creatures of habit with an insatiable need to see familiarity in other people's aetions. Your pre­
dietability gives them a sense of control. Tum the tables: Be deliberately unpredietable. Behavior that seems to
have no consistency or purpose will keep them off-balance, and they will wear themselves out trying to explain
your moves. Taken to an extreme, this strategy can intimidate and terrorize.
LA W 1 i:l page 130
DO NOT BUILD FORTRESSES TO PROTECT YOURSELF-ISOLATION IS DANGEROUS
The world is dangerous and enemies are everywkere-everyone has to proteet themselves. A fortress seems the
safest. But isolation exposes you to more dangers than it protects you from-it cuts you off from valuable in­
formation, it makes you conspicuous and an easy target. Better to circulate among people, find allies, mingle.
You are shielded from your enemies by the crowd.
LAW 19 page 137
KNOW WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH-DO NOT OFFEND THE WRONG PERSON
There are many different kinds of people in the world, and you can never assume that everyone will react to
your strategies in the same way. Deceive or outmaneuver some people and they will spend the rest of their lives
seeking revenge. They are wolves in lambs' clothing. Choose your vietims and opponents carefully, then­
never offend or deceive the wrang person.
CONTENTS Xl

LAW 20 page 145
DO NOT COMMIT TO ANYONE
It is the Jool who always rushes to take sides. Do not commit to any side or cause but yourself. By maintaining
your independence, you become the master oJ others-playing people against one another, making them pursue
you.
LAW 21 page156
PLAY A SUCKER TO CATCH A SUCKER-SEEM DUMBER THAN YOUR MARK
No one likes Jeeling stupider than the next person. The trick, then, is to make your victims Jeel smart-and not
Just smart, but smarter than you are. Once convinced oJ this, they will never suspect that you may have ulttr
rior motives.
LAW 22 page 163
USE THE SURRENDER TACTIC: TRANSFORM WEAKNESS INTO POWER
When you are weaker, never fight Jor honor's sake; choose surrender instead. Surrender gives you time to re­
cover, time to torment and irritate your conqueror, time to wait Jor his power to wane. Do not give him the sat­
isJaction oJ fighting and deJeating you-surrender first. By turning the other cheek you inJuriate and unsettle
him. Make surrender a tool oJ power.
LAW 23 page 171
CONCENTRATE YOUR FORCES
Conserve your Jorces and energies by keeping them concentrated at their strongest point. You gain more by find­
ing a rich mine and mining it deeper, than by flittingjrom one shallow mine to another-intensity deJeats ex­
tensity every time. When looking Jor sources oJ power to elevate you, find the one key patron, the Jat cow who
will give you milk Jor a long time to come.
LAW 24 page 178
PLAY THE PERFECT COURTIER
The perJect courtier thrives in a world where everything revolves around power and political dexterity. He has
mastered the art oJ indirection; he flatters, yields to superiors, and asserts power over others in the most oblique
and graceJul manner. Learn and apply the laws oJ courtiership and there will be no limit to how Jar you can
rise in the court.
LAW 25 page 191
S
RE-CREATE YOUR .ELF
Do not accept the roles that society Joists on you. Re-create yourself by Jorging a new identity, one that com­
mands attention and never bores the audience. Be the master oJ your own image rather than letting others dtr
fine it Jor you. Incorporate dramatic devices into your public gestures and actions-your power will be
enhanced and your character will seem larger than life.
LA W 26 page2 00
KEEPYOURHANDSCLEAN
You must seem a paragon oJ civility and efficiency: Your hands are never soiled by mistakes and nasty deeds.
Maintain such a spotless appearance by using otkers as scapegoats and cat 's-paws to disguise your in­
volvement.

LAW 27 page 215
PLAY ON PEOPLE'S NEED TO BELIEVE TO CREATE A CULTLIKE FOLLOWING
People have an overwhelming desire to believe in something. Become the focal point of such desire by offering
them a cause, a new faith to follow. Keep your words vague but full of promise; emphasize enthusiasm over
rationality and clear thinking. Give your new disciples rituals to perform, ask them to make sacrifi,ces on your
behalf. In the absence of organized religion and grand causes, your new belief system will bring you untold
power.
LAW 28 page227
ENTER ACTION WITH BOLDNESS
If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execu­
tion. Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any mistakes you commit thrvugh audacity are eas­
ily corrected with more audacity. Everyone admires the bold; no one honors the timid.
LAW 29 page 236
PLAN ALL THE WAY TO THE END
The ending is everything. Plan all the way to it, taking into account all the possible consequences, obstacles,
and twists offortune that might reverse your hard work and give the glory to others. By planning to the end
you will not be overwhelmed by circumstances and you will know when to stop. Gently guide fortune and help
determine the future by thinkingfar ahead.
LAW 30 page 245
MAKE YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS SEEM EFFORTLESS
Your actions must seem natural and executed with ease. All the toil and practice that go into them, and also
all the clever tricks, must be concealed. When you act, act effortlessly, as if you could do much more. Avoid the
temptation of revealing how hard you work-it only raises questions. Teach no one your tricks or they will be
used against you.
LAW 31 page254
CONTROL THE OPTIONS: GET OTHERS TO PLAY WITH THE CARDS YOU DEAL
The best deceptions are the ones that seem to give the other person a choice: Your victims feel they are in contral,
but are actually your puppets. Give people options that come out in your favor whichever one they choose. Forr;e
them to make choices between the lesser of two evils, both of which seroe your purpose. Put them on the horns of
a dilemma: They are gored wherever they turn.
LAW 32 page263
PLAY TO PEOPLE'S FANTASIES
The truth is often avoided because it is ugly and unpleasant. Never appeal to tru,th and reality unless you are
prepared for the anger that comes frvm disenchantment. Life is so harsh and distressing that people who can
manufacture romance or conjure up fantasy are like oases in the desert: Everyone flocks to them. There is great
power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses.

DISCOVER EACH MAN'S THUMBSCREW
Everyone has a weakness, a gap in the castle wall. That weakness is usually an insecurity, an uncontrollable
emotion or need; it can also be a small secret pleasure. Either way, once Jound, it is a thumbscrew you can turn
to your advantage.
LAW :H page 282
BE ROYAL IN YOUR OWN FASHION: ACT LIKE A KING TO BE TREATED LIKE ONE
The way you carry yourself will oßen determine how you are treated: In the long TUn, appearing vulgar or com­
mon will make people disrespect you. For a king respects himself and inspires the same sentiment in others. By
acting regally and confident oJ your powers, you make yourself seem destined to wear a crown.
LAW ,,5 page291
MASTER THE ART OF TIMING
Never seem to be in a hurry-hurrying betrays a lack oJ control over yourself, and over time. Always seem pa­
tient, as if you know that everything will come to you eventually. Become a detective oJ the right moment; sniff
out the spirit oJ the times, the trends that will carry you to power. Leam to stand back when the time is not yet
ripe, and to strike fiercely when it has reached fruition.
LAW :16 page 300
DISDAIN THINGS YOU CANNOT HAVE: IGNORING THEM IS THE BEST REVENGE
By acknowledging a petty problem you give it existence and credibility. The more attention you pay an enemy,
the stronger you make him; and a small mistake is oßen made worse and more visible when you try to fix it. It
is sometimes best to leave things alone. If there is something you want but cannot have, show contempt Jor it.
The less interest you reveal, the more superior you seem.
LAW �7 page309
CREATE COMPELLING SPECTACLES
Striking imagery and grand symbolic gestures create the aura oJ power-everyone responds to them. Stage spec­
tacles Jor those around you, then, Jull oJ arresting visuals and radiant symbols that heighten your presence.
Dazzled by appearances, no one will notice what you are really doing.
LAW �g page3 17
THINK AS YOU LIKE BUT BEHAVE LIKE OTHERS
If you make a show oJ going against the times, flaunting your unconventional ideas and unorthodox ways,
people will think that you only want attention and that you look down upon them. They will find a way to
punish you Jor making them Jeel inJerior. It is Jar saJer to blend in and nurture the common touch. Share your
originality only with tolerant Jriends and those who are sure to appreciate your uniqueness.
LAW :39 page 325
STIR UP WATERS TO CATCH FISH
Anger and emotion are strategically counterproductive. You must always stay calm and objective. But if you
can make your enemies angry while staying calm yourself, you gain a decided advantage. Put your enemies
off-balance: Find the chink in their vanity through which you can rattle them and you hold the strings.

DESPISE THE FREE LUNCH
'What is offered Jor Jree is dangerous-it usually involves either a trick or a hidden obligation. 'What has worth
is worth paying Jor. By paying your own way you stay clear oJ gratitude, guilt, and deceit. It is also often wise
to pay the Jull price-t-here is no cutting corners with excellence. Be lavish with your money and keep it circu­
lating, Jor generosity is a sign and a magnet Jor power.
LAW 41 page 347
AVOID STEPPING INTO A GREAT MAN'S SHOES
'What happens first always appears better and more original than what comes after. If you succeed a great man
or have a Jamous parent, you will have to accomplish double their achievements to outshine them. Do not get

STRIKE THE SHEPHERD AND THE SHEEP WILL SCATTER
Trouble can often be traced to a single strong individual-the stirrer, the arrogant underling, the poisoner oJ
goodwill. If you allow such people room to operate, others will succumb to their injluence. Do not wait Jor the
troubles they cause to multiply, do not try to negotiate with them-they are irredeemable. Neutralize their in­
fluence lry isolating or banishing them. Strike at the source oJ the trouble and the sheep will scatter.

WORK ON THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OTHERS
Coercion creates a reaction that will eventually work against you. You must seduce others into wanting to
move in your direction. A person you have seduced becomes your loyal pawn. And the way to seduce others is to
operate on their individual psychologies and weaknesses. Soften up the resistant lry working on their emotions,

NEVER APPEAR TOO PERFECT
Appearing better than others is always dangerous, but most dangerous of alt is to appear to have no faults or

perfeet with impunity.

DO NOT GO PAST THE MARK YOU AIMED FOR;
IN VICTORY, LEARN WHEN TO STOP
The moment of vietory is often the moment of greatest peril. In the heat of vietory, arroganee and overeonfi­

goal, and when you reaeh it, stop.

ASSUME FORMLESSNESS
By taking a shape, by having a visible plan, you open yourself to attaek. Instead of taking a form for your
enemy to grasp, keep yourself adaptable and on the move. Aeeept the faet that nothing is eertain and no law is

PREFACE
The feeling of having no power over people and events is generally un­
bearable to us--when we feel helpless we feel miserable. No one wants less
power; everyone wants more. In the world today, however, it is dangerous
to seem too power hungry, to be overt with your power moves. We have
to seem fair and decent. So we need to be subtle-congenial yet cunning,
democratic yet devious.
This game of constant duplicity most resembles the power dynamic
that existed in the scheming world of the old aristocratic court. Throughout
history, a court has always formed itself around the person in power-king,
queen, emperor, leader. The courtiers who filled this court were in an espe­
cially delicate position: They had to serve their masters, but if they seemed
to fawn, if they curried favor too obviously, the other courtiers around
them would notice and would act against them. Attempts to win the mas­
ter's favor, then, had to be subtle. And even skilIed courtiers capable of
such subtlety still had to protect themselves from their fellow courtiers,
who at all moments were scheming to push them aside.
Meanwhile the court was supposed to represent the height of civiliza­
tion and refinement. Violent or overt power moves were frowned upon;
courtiers would work silently and secretly against any among them who
used force. This was the courtier's dilemma: While appearing the very
paragon of elegance, they had to outwit and thwart their own opponents in
the subdest of ways. The successful courtier learned over time to make all
of his moves indirect; if he stabbed an opponent in the back, it was with a
velvet glove on his hand and the sweetest of srniles on his face. Instead of
using coercion or outright treachery, the perfect courtier got his way
through seduction, charm, deception, and subtle strategy, always planning
several moves ahead. Life in the court was a never-ending game that re­
quired constant vigilance and tactical thinking. It was civilized war.
Today we face a peculiarly similar paradox to that of the courtier:
Everything must appear civilized, decent, democratic, and fair. But if we
play by those rules too strictly, if we take them too literally, we are crushed
by those around us who are not so foolish. As the great Renaissance diplo­
mat and courtier Niccolö Machiavelli wrote, ''Any man who tries to be
good all the time is bound to come to ruin among the great number who
are not good." The court imagined itself the pinnacle of refinement, but un-

derneath its glittering surface a cauldron of dark emotions---greed, envy,
lust, hatred-boiled and simmered. Our world today similarly imagines it­

To some people the notion of consciously playing power games---no mat­

can opt out of the game by behaving in ways that have nothing to do with
power. You must beware of such people, for while they express such opin­
ions outwardly, they are often among the most adept players at power.
They utilize strategies that cleverly disguise the nature of the manipulation

The most important of these skills, and power's crucial foundation, is

Power requires the ability to play with appearanees. To this end you
must learn to wear many masks and keep a bag full of deceptive tricks. De­
ception and masquerade should not be seen as ugly or immoral. All human
interaction requires deception on many levels, and in some ways what sep­
arates humans from animals is our ability to lie and deceive. In Greek
myths, in India's Mahabharata cyde, in the MiddleE astern epic ofG ilga­
mesh, it is the privilege of the gods to use deceptive arts; a great man,
Odysseus for instance, wasj udged by his ability to riyal the craftiness of the
gods, stealing some of their divine power by matching them in wits and de­
ception. Deeeption is a developed art of civilization and the most potent
weapon in the game of power.
xx PREFACE

[PAGE 22]
You cannot succeed at deception unless you take a somewhat dis­
tanced approach to yourself-unless you can be many different people,
wearing the mask that the day and the moment require. With such a flexi­
ble approach to all appearances, induding your own, you lose a lot of the
inward heaviness that holds people down. Make your face as malleable as
the actor's, work to conceal your intentions from others, practice luring
people into traps. Playing with appearances and mastering arts of decep­
tion are among the aesthetic pleasures of life. They are also key compo­
nents in the acquisition of power.
If deception is the most potent weapon in your arsenal, then patience
in all things is your crucial shield. Patience will protect you from making
moronic blunders. Like mastering your emotions, patience is a skill-it
does not come naturally. But nothing about power is natural; power is
more godlike than anything in the natural world. And patience is the
supreme virtue of the gods, who have nothing but time. Everything good
will happen-the grass will grow again, if you give it time and see several
steps into the future. Impatience, on the other hand, only makes you look
weak. It is a principal impediment to power.
Power is essentially amoral and one of the most important skills to ac­
quire is the ability to see circumstances rather than good or evil. Power is a
game-this cannot be repeated too often-and in games you do not judge
your opponents by their intentions but by the effect of their actions. You
measure their strategy and their power by what you can see and feel. How
often are someone's intentions made the issue only to doud and deceive!
What does it matter if another player, your friend or riyal, intended good
things and had only your interests at heart, if the effects of his action lead to
so much ruin and confusion? It is only natural for people to cover up their
actions with all kinds of justifications, always assuming that they have acted
out of goodness. You must learn to inwardly laugh each time you hear this
and never get caught up in gauging someone's intentions and actions
through a set of moral judgments that are really an excuse far the accumu­
lation of power.
It is a game. Your opponent sits opposite you. Both of you behave as
gentlemen or ladies, observing the rules of the game and taking nothing
personally. You play with a strategy and you observe your opponent's
moves with as much calmness as you can muster. In the end, you will ap­
preciate the politeness of those you are playing with more than their good
and sweet intentions. Train your eye to follow the results of their moves,
the outward circumstances, and do not be distracted by anything else.
Half of your mastery of power comes from what you do not do, what
you do not allow yourself to get dragged into. For this skill you must learn
to judge all things by what they cost you. As Nietzsche wrote, "The value of
a thing sometimes lies not in what one attains with it, but in what one pays
for it-what it costsus." Perhaps you will attain your goal, and a worthy goal
at that, but at what price? Apply this standard to everything, induding
whether to collaborate with other people or come to their aid. In the end,
PREFACE xxi

[PAGE 23]
life is short, opportunities are few, and you have only so much energy to
draw on. And in this sense time is as important a consideration as any
other. Never waste valuable time, or mental peace of mind, on the affairs of
others-that is too high a price to pay.
Power is a social game. To leam and master it, you must develop the
ability to study and understand people. As the great seventeenth-century
thinker and courtier Baltasar Graciän wrote: "Many people spend time
studying the properties of animals or herbs; how much more important it
would be to study those of people, with whom we must live or die!" To be a
master player you must also be a master psychologist. You must recognize
motivations and see through the cloud of dust with which people surround
their actions. An understanding of people's hidden motives is the single
greatest piece of knowledge you can have in acquiring power. It opens up
endless possibilities of deception, seduction, and manipulation.
People are of infinite complexity and you can spend a lifetime watch­
(
ing them without ever fully understanding them. So it is all the more im­
portant, then, to begin your education now. In doing so you must also keep
one principle in mind: Never discriminate as to whom you study and
i whom you trust. Never trust anyone completely and study everyone, in­
cluding friends and loved ones.
Finally, you must leam always to take the indirect route to power. Dis­
guise your cunning. Like a billiard ball that caroms several times before it
hits its target, your moves must be planned and developed in the least ob­
vious way. By training yourself to be indirect, you can thrive in the modem
court, appearing the paragon of decency while being the consummate ma­
nipulator.
Consider The 48 Laws of Power a kind of handbook on the arts of indirec­
tion. The laws are based on the writings of men and women who have
studied and mastered the game of power. These writings span a period of
more than three thousand years and were created in civilizations as dis­
parate as ancient China and Renaissance Italy; yet they share common
threads and themes, together hinting at an essence of power that has yet to
be fully articulated. The 48 laws of power are the distillation of this accu­
mulated wisdom, gathered from the writings of the most illustrious strate­
gists (Sun-tzu, Clausewitz), statesmen (Bismarck, Talleyrand), courtiers
(Castiglione, Graciän), seducers (Ninon de Lenclos, Casanova), and con
artists ("Yellow Kid" Weil) in history.
The laws have a simple premise: Certain actions almost always in­
crease one's power (the observance of the law), while others decrease it
and even ruin us (the transgression of the law). These transgressions and
observances are illustrated by historical examples. The laws are timeless
and definitive.
The 48 Laws of Power can be used in several ways. By reading the book
straight through you can leam about power in general. Although several of
the laws may seem not to pertain directly to your life, in time you will
xxii PREFACE

[PAGE 24]
probably find that all of them have some application, and that in fact they
are interrelated. By getting an overview of the entire subject you will best
be able to evaluate your own past actions and gain a greater degree of con­
trol over your immediate affairs. A thorough reading of the book will in­
spire thinking and reevaluation long after you finish it.
The book has also been designed for browsing and for examining the
law that seems at that particular moment most pertinent to you. Say you
are experiencing problems with a superior and cannot understand why
YOUf efforts have not lead to more gratitude or a promotion. Several laws
specifically address the master-underling relationship, and you are almost
certainly transgressing one of them. By browsing the initial paragraphs for
the 48 laws in the table of contents, you can identify the pertinent law.
Finally, the book can be browsed through and picked apart for enter­
tainment, for an enjoyable ride through the foibles and great deeds of our
predecessors in power. A warning, however, to those who use the book for
this purpose: It might be better to turn back. Power is endlessly seductive
and deceptive in its own way. It is a labyrinth-your mind becomes con­
sumed with solving its infinite problems, and you so on realize how pleas­
antly lost you have become. In other words, it becomes most amusing by
taking it seriously. Do not be frivolous with such a critical matter. The gods
of power frown on the frivolous; they give ultimate satisfaction only to
those who study and reflect, and punish those who skim the surfaces look­
ing for a good time.
Any man who tries to be good alt the time is bound to come to ruin
among the great number who are not good. Hence a prince who wants
to keep his authority must leam how not to be good, and use that
knowledge, or refrain from using it, necessity requires.

TRANSGRESSION OF THE LAW
Nicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV's finance minister in the first years ofhis reign,
was a generous man who loved lavish parties, pretty women, and poetry.
He also loved money, for he led an extravagant lifestyle. Fouquet was
clever and very much indispensable to the king, so when the prime minis­
ter, Jules Mazarin, died, in 1661, the finance minister expected to be
named the successor. Instead, the king decided to abolish the position. This
and other signs made Fouquet suspect that he was falling out of favor, and
so he decided to ingratiate hirnself with the king by staging the most spec­
tacular party the world had ever seen. The party's ostensible purpose
would be to commemorate the completion of Fouquet's chateau, Vaux-Ie­
Vicomte, but its real function was to pay tribute to the king, the guest of
honor.
The most brilliant nobility of Europe and some of the greatest minds
of the time-La Fontaine, La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Sevigne­
attended the party. Moliere wrote a play for the occasion, in which he
hirnselfwas to perform at the evening's conclusion. The party began with a
lavish seven-course dinner, featuring foods from the Orient never be­
fore tasted in France, as weH as new dishes created especiaHy for the night.
The meal was accompanied with music commissioned by Fouquet to
honor the king.
Mter dinner there was a promenade through the chateau's gardens.
The grounds and fountains of Vaux-Ie-Vicomte were to be the inspiration
for VersaiHes.
Fouquet personally accompanied the young king through the geomet­
rically aligned arrangements of shrubbery and flower beds. Arrlving at the
gardens' canals, they witnessed a fireworks display, which was followed by
the performance of Moliere's play. The party ran weH into the night and
everyone agreed it was the most amazing affair they had ever attended.
The next day, Fouquet was arrested by the king's head musketeer,
D'A rtagnan. Three months later he went on trial for stealing from the
country's treasury. (Actually, most ofthe stealing he was accused ofhe had
done on the king's behalf and with the king's permission.) Fouquet was
found guilty and sent to the most isolated prison in France, high in the
Pyrenees Mountains, where he spent the last twenty years of his life in soli­
tary confinement.
Interpretation
Louis XN, the Sun King, was a proud and arrogant man who wanted to be
the center of attention at all times; he could not countenance being out­
done in lavishness by anyone, and certainly not his finance minister. To
succeed Fouquet, Louis chose Jean-Baptiste Colbert, a man famous for his
parsimony and for giving the duHest parties in Paris. Colbert made sure
that any money liberated from the treasury went straight into Louis's
hands. With the money, Louis built a palace even more magnificent than
Fouquet's-the glorious palace of Versailles. He used the same architects,
2 LAW 1

[PAGE 27]
decorators, and garden designer. And at Versailles, Louis hosted parties
even more extravagant than the one that cost Fouquet his freedom.
Let us examine the situation. The evening of the party, as Fouquet pre­
sented spectacle on spectacle to Louis, each more magnificent than the one
before, he imagined the affair as demonstrating his loyalty and devotion to
the king. Not only did he think the party would put hirn back in the king's
favor, he thought it would show his good taste, his connections, and his
popularity, making hirn indispensable to the king and demonstrating that
he would make an excellent prime minister. Instead, however, each new
spectacle, each appreciative smile bestowed by the guests on Fouquet,
made it seem to Louis that his own friends and subjects were more
charmed by the finance minister than by the king hirnself, and that Fouquet
was actually flaunting his wealth and power. Rather than flattering Louis
XIV, Fouquet's elaborate party offended the king's vanity. Louis would not
admit this to anyone, of course-i-nstead, he found a convenient excuse to
rid hirnse lf of a man who had inadvertently made hirn feel insecure.
Such is the fate, in some form or other, of all those who unbalance the
master's sense of self, poke holes in his vanity, or make hirn doubt his pre­
eminence.
When the evening began, Fouquet was at the top 0/ the world.
By the time it had ended, he was at the bottom.
Voltaire, 1694-1778
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In the early 1600s, the ltalian astronomer and mathematician Galileo
found hirnself in a precarious position. He depended on the generosity of
great rulers to support his research, and so, like all Renaissance scientists,
he would sometimes make gifts of his inventions and discoveries to the
leading patrons of the time. Once, for instance, he presented a military
compass he had invented to the Duke of Gonzaga. Then he dedicated a
book explaining the use of the compass to the Medicis. Both rulers were
grateful, and through them Galileo was able to find more students to teach.
No matter how great the discovery, however, his patrons usually paid hirn
with gifts, not cash. This made for a life of constant insecurity and depen­
dence. There must be an easier way, he thought.
Galileo hit on a new strategy in 1610, when he discovered the moons
of Jupiter. Instead of dividing the discovery among his patrons-giving
one the telescope he had used, dedicating a book to another, and so on-as
he had done in the past, he decided to focus exclusively on the Medicis. He
chose the Medicis for one reason: Shortly after Cosimo I had established
the Medici dynasty, in 1540, he had made Jupiter, the mightiest of the
gods, the Medici symbol-a symbol of a power that went beyond politics
and banking, one linked to ancient Rome and its divinities.
Galileo tumed his discovery of Jupiter's moons into a cosmic event
LAW 1 3

[PAGE 28]
honoring the Medicis' greatness. Shortly after the discovery, he announced
that "the bright stars [the moons of Jupiterl offered themselves in the heav­
ens" to his telescope at the same time as Cosimo II's enthronement. He
said that the number of the moons-four-harmonized with the number of
the Medicis (Cosimo 11 had three brothers) and that the moons orbited
Jupiter as these four sons revolved around Cosimo I, the dynasty's founder.
More than coincidence, this showed that the heavens themselves reflected
the ascendancy of the Medici family. After he dedicated the discovery to
the Medicis, Galileo commissioned an emblem representingJupiter sitting
on a cloud with the four stars circling about hirn, and presented this to
Cosimo 11 as a symbol of his link to the stars.
In 1610 Cosimo 11 made Galileo his official court philosopher and
mathematician, with a full salary. For a scientist this was the coup of a life­
time. The days of begging for patronage were over.
Interpretation
In one stroke, Galileo gained more with his new strategy than he had in
years of begging. The reason is simple: All masters want to appear more
brilliant than other people.
They do not care about science or empirical truth or the latest inven­
tion; they care about their name and their glory. Galileo gave the Medicis
infinitely more glory by linking their name with cosmic forces than he had
by making them the patrons of some new scientific gadget or discovery.
Scientists are not spared the vagaries of court life and patronage. They
too must serve masters who hold the purse strings. And their great intellec­
tual powers can make the master feel insecure, as if he were only there to
supply the funds-an ugly, ignoble job. The producer of a great work
wants to feel he is more than just the provider of the financing. He wants to
appear creative and powerful, and also more important than the work pro­
duced in his name. Instead of insecurity you must give hirn glory. Galileo
did not challenge the intellectu� authority of the Medicis with his discov­
ery, or make them feel inferior in any way; by literally aligning them with
the stars, he made them shine brilliantly among the courts of Italy. He did
not outshine the master, he made the master outshine all others.
KEYS TO POWER
Everyone has insecurities. When you show yourself in the world and dis­
play your talents, you naturally stir up all kinds of resentrnent, envy, and
other manifestations of insecurity. This is to be expected. You cannot spend
your life worrying about the petty feelings of others. With those above you,
however, you must take a different approach: When it comes to power,
outshining the master is perhaps the worst mi stake of all.
Do not fool yourself into thinking that life has changed much since the
days of Louis XIV and the Medicis. Those who attain high standing in life
are like kings and queens: They want to feel secure in their positions, and
4 LAW 1

[PAGE 29]
superior to those around them in intelligence, wit, and charm. It is a deadly
but common misperception to believe that by displaying and vaunting
YOUf gifts and talents, you are winning the master's affection. He may feign
appreciation, but at his first opportunity he will replace you with someone
less intelligent, less attractive, less threatening, just as Louis XIV replaced
the sparkling Fouquet with the bland Colbert. And as with Louis, he will
not admit the truth, but will find an excuse to rid hirnself of YOUf presence.
This Law involves two rules that you must realize. First, you can inad­
vertently outshine a master simply by being YOUfself. There are masters
who are more insecure than others, monstrously insecUfe; you may natu­
rally outshine them by YOUf charm and grace.
No one had more natural talents than Astorre Manfredi, prince of
Faenza. The most handsome of all the young princes of Italy, he captivated
his subjects with his generosity and open spirit.
In the year 1500, Cesare Borgia laid siege to Faenza. When the city
surrendered, the citizens expected the worst from the cruel Borgia, who,
however, decided to spare the town: He simply occupied its fortress, exe­
cuted none of its citizens, and allowed Prince Manfredi, eighteen at the
time, to remain with his court, in complete freedom.
A few weeks later, though, soldiers hauled Astorre Manfredi away to a
Roman prison. A year after that, his body was fished out of the River
Tiber, a stone tied around his neck. Borgia justified the horrible deed with
so me sort of trumped-up charge of treason and conspiracy, but the real
problem was that he was notoriously vain and insecure. The young man
was outshining hirn without even trying. Given Manfredi's natural talents,
the prince's mere presence made Borgia seem less attractive and charis­
matic. The lesson is simple: If you cannot help being charming and supe­
rior, you must leam to avoid such monsters of vanity. Either that, or find a
way to mute your good qualities when in the company of aCesare Borgia.
Second, never imagine that because the master loves you, you can do
anything you want. Entire books could be written about favorites who fell
out of favor by taking their status for granted, for daring to outshine. In
late-sixteenth-century Japan, the favorite of Emperor Hideyoshi was a man
called Sen no Rikyu. The premier artist of the tea ceremony, which had be­
come an obsession with the nobility, he was one of Hideyoshi's most
trusted advisers, had his own apartment in the palace, and was honored
throughoutJapan. Yet in 1591, Hideyoshi had hirn arrested and sentenced
to death. Rikyu took his own life, instead. The cause for his sudden change
of fortune was discovered later: It seems that Rikyu, former peasant and
later court favorite, had had a wooden statue made of hirnself wearing san­
dals (a sign of nobility) and posing loftily. He had had this statue placed in
the most important temple inside the palace gates, in clear sight of the roy­
alty who often would pass by. To Hideyoshi this signified that Rikyu had
no sense of limits. Presuming that he had the same rights as those of the
highest nobility, he had forgotten that his position depended on the em­
peror, and had co me to believe that he had earned it on his own. This was
LAW 1 5

[PAGE 30]
an unforgivable miscalculation of his own importance and he paid for it
with his life. Remember the following: Never take your position for
granted and never let any favors you receive go to your head.
Knowing the dangers of outshining your master, you can turn this Law
to your advantage. First you must flatter and puff up your master. Overt
flattery can be effective but has its limits; it is too direct and obvious, and
looks bad to other courtiers. Discreet flattery is much more powerful. If
you are more intelligent than your master, for example, seem the opposite:
Make hirn appear more intelligent than you. Act naive. Make it seem that
you need his expertise. Commit harmless mistakes that will not hurt you in
the long run but will give you the chance to ask for his help. Masters adore
such requests. A master who cannot bestow on you the gifts of his experi­
ence may direct rancor and ill will at you instead.
If your ideas are more creative than your master's, ascribe them to
hirn, in as public a manner as possible. Make it clear that your advice is
merely an echo of his advice.
If you surpass your master in wit, it is okay to play the role of the court
jester, but do not make hirn appear cold and surly by comparison. Tone
down your humor if necessary, and find ways to make hirn seem the dis­
penser of amusement and good cheer. If you are naturally more sociable
and generous than your master, be careful not to be the cloud that blocks
his radiance from others. He must appear as the sun around which every­
one revolves, radiating power and brilliance, the center of attention. If you
are thrust into the position of entertaining hirn, a display of your limited
means may win you his sympathy. Any attempt to impress hirn with your
grace and generosity can prove fatal: Learn from Fouquet or pay the price.
In all of these cases it is not a weakness to disguise your strengths if
in the end they lead to power. By letting others outshine you, you remain
in control, instead of being a victim of their insecurity. This will all come in
handy the day you decide to rise above your inferior status. If, like Galileo,
you can make your master shine even more in the eyes of others, then you
are a godsend and you will be instantly promoted.

Authority: Avoid outshining the master. All superiority is odious, but the
superiority of a subject over his prince is not only stupid, it is fatal. This is a
lesson that the stars in the sky teach us-they may be related to the sun,
and just as brilliant, but they never appear in her company. (Baltasar
Gracian, 1601-165R)
REVERSAL
You cannot worry about upsetting every person you corne across, but you
must be selectively cruel. If your superior is a falling star, there is nothing
to fear from outshining hirn. Do not be merciful-your master had no such
scruples in his own cold-blooded climb to the top. Gauge his strength. If he
is weak, discreetly hasten his downfall: Outdo, outcharm, outsrnart hirn at
key moments. If he is very weak and ready to fall, let nature take its course.
Do not risk outshining a feeble superior-it rnight appear cruel or spiteful.
But if your master is firm in his position, yet you know yourself to be the
more capable, bide your time and be patient. It is the natural course of
things that power eventually fades and weakens. Your master will fall
someday, and if you play it right, you will outlive and sorneday outshine
hirn.

They laugh extra hard at each other's jokes. Since honesty rarely strength­

say that they love your poetry, adore your music, envy your taste in
clothes-maybe they mean it, often they do not.
When you decide to hire a friend, you gradually discover the qualities
he or she has kept hidden. Strangely enough, it is your act of kindness that
unbalances everything. People want to feel they des erve their good for­
tune. The receipt of a favor can become oppressive: It means you have
been chosen because you are a friend, not necessarily because you are de­
serving. There is almost a touch of condescension in the act of hiring
friends that secretly afflicts them. The injury will come out slowly: A little
more honesty, flashes of resentment and envy here and there, and before
you know it your friendship fades. The more favors and gifts you supply to
revive the friendship, the less gratitude you receive.

make a point of putting hirn in your service.
As Lincoln said, you destroy an enemy when you make a friend of
hirn. In 1971, during the Vietnam War, Henry Kissinger was the target of
an unsuccessful kidnapping attempt, a conspiracy involving, among others,
the renowned antiwar activist priests the Berrigan brothers, four more
Catholic priests, and four nuns. In private, without informing the Secret
Service or the Justice Department, Kissinger arranged a Saturday-morning
meeting with three of the alleged kidnappers. Explaining to his guests that
he would have most American soldiers out of Vietnam by mid-1972, he
completely charmed them. They gave hirn some "Kidnap Kissinger" but­
tons and one of them remained a friend of his for years, visiting hirn on
several occasions. This was not just a onetime ploy: Kissinger made a pol­
icy of working with those who disagreed with hirn. Colleagues commented
that he seemed to get along better with his enemies than with his friends.
Without enemies around us, we grow lazy. An enemy at our heels

LAW 2 13

[PAGE 38]
then, to use enemies as enemies rather than transforming them into friends
or allies.
Mao Tse-tung saw conflict as key in his approach to power. In 1937 the
Japanese invaded China, interrupting the civil war between Mao's Com­
munists and their enemy, the Nationalists.
Fearing that the Japanese would wipe them out, some Communist
leaders advocated leaving the Nationalists to fight the Japanese, and using
the time to recuperate. Mao disagreed: The Japanese could not possibly
defeat and occupy a vast country like China for long. Once they left, the
Communists would have grown rusty if they had been out of combat for
several years, and would be ill prepared to reopen their struggle with the
Nationalists. To fight a formidable foe like the Japanese, in fact, would be
the perfect training for the Communists' ragtag army. Mao's plan was
adopted, and it worked: By the time the Japanese finally retreated, the
Communists had gained the fighting experience that helped them defeat
the Nationalists.
Years later, a Japanese visitor tried to apologize to Mao for his coun­
try's invasion of China. Mao interrupted, "Should I not thank you in­
stead?" Without a worthy opponent, he explained, a man or group cannot
grow stronger.
Mao's strategy of constant conflict has several key components. First,
be certain that in the long run you will emerge victorious. Never pick a
fight with someone you are not sure you can defeat, as Mao knew the
Japanese would be defeated in time. Second, if you have no apparent ene­
mies, you must sometimes set up a convenient target, even tuming a friend
into an enemy. Mao used this tactic time and again in politics. Third, use
such enemies to define your cause more clearly to the public, even framing
it as a struggle of good against evil. Mao actually encouraged China's dis­
agreements with the Soviet Union and the United States; without clear-cut
enemies, he believed, his people would lose any sense of what Chinese
Communism meant. A sharply defined enemy is a far stronger argument
for your side than all the words you could possibly put together.
Never let the presence of enemies upset or distress you-you are far
better off with a declared opponent or two than not knowing where your
real enemies lie. The man of power welcomes conflict, using enemies to
enhance his reputation as a surefooted fighter who can be relied upon in
times of uncertainty.

REVERSAL
Although it is generally best not to mix work with friendship, there are
times when a friend can be used to greater effect than an enemy. A man of
power, for example, often has dirty work that has to be done, but for the
sake of appearances it is generally preferable to have other people do it for
him; friends often do this the best, since their affection for hirn makes them
willing to take chances. Also, if YOUf plans go awry for some reason, you
can use a friend as a convenient scapegoat. This "fall of the favorite" was a
trick often used by kings and sovereigns: They would let their dosest friend
at court take the fall for amistake, since the public would not believe that
they would deliberately sacrifice a friend for such a purpose. Of course,
after you play that card, you have lost your friend forever. It is best, then, to
reserve the scapegoat role for someone who is dose to you but not too
elose.
Finally, the problem abo ut working with friends is that it confuses the
boundaries and distances that working requires. But if both partners in the
aranr gement understand the dangers involved, a friend often can be em­
ployed to great effect. You must never let YOUf guard down in such a ven­
ture, however; always be on the lookout for any signs of emotional
disturbance such as envy and ingratitude. Nothing is stable in the realm of
power, and even the dosest offriends can be transformed into the worst of
enemies.

Over several weeks, Ninon de Lenclos, the most infamous courtesan of
seventeenth-century France, listened patiently as the Marquis de Sevigne
explained his struggles in pursuing a heautiful hut difficult young countess.
Ninon was sixty-two at the time, and more than experienced in matters of
love; the marquis was a lad of twenty-two, handsome, dashing, hut hope­
lessly inexperienced in romance. At first Ninon was amused to hear the
marquis talk ahout his mistakes, hut finally she had had enough. Unahle to
hear ineptitude in any realm, least of all in seducing a woman, she decided
to take the young man under her wing. First, hE\ had to und erstand that this
was war, and that the heautiful countess was a Citadel to which he had to
lay siege as carefully as any general. Every step had to he planned and exe­

Instructing the marquis to start over, Ninon told him to approach the
countess with a hit of distance, an air of nonchalance. The next time the
two were alone together, she said, he would confide in the countess as
would a friend hut nota potential lover. This was to throw her offthe scent.
The countess was no longer to take his interest in her for granted-perhaps
he was only interested in friendship.
Ninon planned ahead. Once the countess was confused, it would he

marquis would show up with a heautiful young woman at his side. This
heautiful young woman had equally heautiful friends, so that wherever the
countess would now see the marquis, he would he surrounded hy the most
stunning young women in Paris. Not only would the countess he seething
with jealousy, she would come to see the marquis as someone who was de­

fairs where the countess expected to see him. Then, suddenly, he would

tended often. She would be unable to predict his moves. All of this would
push her into the state of emotional confusion that is aprerequisite for suc­
cessful seduction.
These moves were executed, and took several weeks. Ninon moni­
tored the marquis's progress: Through her network of spies, she heard how
the countess would laugh a litde harder at his witticisms, listen more
closely to his stories. She heard that the countess was suddenly asking ques­
tions about hirn. Her friends told her that at social affairs the countess
would often look up at the marquis, following his steps. Ninon feJt certain
that the young woman was falling under his spell. It was a matter of weeks
now, maybe a month or two, but if all went smoothly, the citadel would

A few days later the marquis was at the countess's horne. They were
alone. Suddenly he was a different man: This time acting on his own im­
pulse, rather than following Ninon's instructions, he took the countess's
hands and told her he was in love with her. The young woman seemed
confused, areaction he did not expect. She became polite, then excused
herself. For the rest of the evening she avoided his eyes, was not there to
say good-night to hirn. The next few times he visited he was told she was
not at horne. When she finally admitted hirn again, the two feIt awkward
and uncomfortable with each other. The spell was broken.
Interpretation
Ninon de Lenclos knew everything about the art of love. The greatest writ­
ers, thinkers, and politicians of the time had been her lovers-men like La
Rochefoucauld, Moliere, and Richelieu. Seduction was agame to her, to be
practiced with skill. As she got older, and her reputation grew, the most im­
portant families in France would send their sons to her to be instructed in
matters oflove.
Ninon knew that men and women are very different, but when it
comes to seduction they feel the same: Deep down inside, they often sense
when they are being seduced, but they give in because they enjoy the feel­
ing of being led along. It is a pleasure to let go, and to allow the other per­
son to detour you into a strange country. Everything in seduction,
however, depends on suggestion. You cannot announce yOUf intentions or
reveal them direcdy in words. Instead you must throw your targets off the
scent. To surrender to YOUf guidance they must be appropriately confused.
You have to scramble your signals-appear interested in another man or
woman (the decoy), then hint at being interested in the target, then feign
indifference, on and on. Such patterns not only confuse, they excite.
Imagine this story from the countess's perspective: After a few of the
marquis's moves, she sensed the marquis was playing some sort of game,
but the game delighted her. She did not know where he was leading her,
but so much the better. His moves intrigued her, each of them keeping her
waiting for the next one--she even enjoyed her jealousy and confusion, for
sometimes any emotion is better than the boredom of security. Perhaps the
marquis had uIterior motives; most men do. But she was willing to wait and

see, and probably if she had been made to wait long enough, what he was
up to would not have mattered.
The moment the marquis uttered that fatal word "love," however, all
was changed. This was no longer agame with moves, it was an artless show
of passion. His intention was revealed: He was seducing her. This put
everything he had done in a new light. All that before had been charming

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 1850 the young Otto von Bismarck, then a thirty-five-year-old deputy in
the Prussian parliament, was at a turning point in his career. The issues of
the day were the unification of the many states (including Prussia) into
which Germany was then divided, and a war against Austria, the powerful
neighbor to the south that hoped to keep the Germans weak and at odds,
even threatening to intervene if they tried to unite. Prince William, next in
line to be Prussia's king, was in favor of going to war, and the parliament
rallied to the cause, prepared to back any mobilization of troops. The only
ones to oppose war were the present king, Frederick William IV, and his
ministers, who preferred to appease the powerful Austrians.
Throughout his career, Bismarck had been a loyal, even passionate
supporter of Prussian might and power. He dreamed of German unifica­
tion, of going to war against Austria and humiliating the country that for so
long had kept Germany divided. A former soldier, he saw warfa re as a glo­
rious business.
This, after all, was the man who years later would say, "The great
questions of the time will be decided, not by speeches and resolutions, but
by iron and blood."
Passionate patriot and lover of military glory, Bismarck nevertheless
gave a speech in parliament at the height of the war fever that astonished
all who heard it. "Woe unto the statesman," he said, "who makes war with­
out a reason that will still be valid when the war is over! After the war, you
will all look differently at these questions. Will you then have the courage
to turn to the peasant contemplating the ashes of his farm, to the man who
has been crippled, to the father who has lost his children?" Not only did
Bismarck go on to talk of the madness of this war, but, strangest of all, he
praised Austria and defended her actions. This went against everything he
had stood for. The consequences were immediate. Bismarck was against
the war-what could this possibly mean? Other deputies were confused,
and several of them changed their votes. Eventually the king and his minis­
ters won out, and war was averted.
A few weeks after Bismarck's infamous speech, the king, grateful that
LAW 3 19

[PAGE 44]
he had spoken for peace, made hirn a cabinet minister. A few years later he
became the Prussian premier. In this role he eventuaIly led his country and
a peace-loving king into a war against Austria, crushing the former empire
and establishing a mighty German state, with Prussia at its head.
Interpretation
At the time of his speech in 1850, Bismarck made several calculations.
First, he sensed that the Prussian military, which had not kept pace with
other European armies, was unready for war-that Austria, in fact, might
very weIl win, a disastrous result for the future. Second, if the war were lost
and Bismarck had supported it, his career would be gravely jeopardized.
The king and his conservative ministers wanted peace; Bismarck wanted
power. The answer was to throw people off the scent by supporting a cause
he detested, saying things he would laugh at if said by another. A whole
country was fooled. It was because of Bismarck's speech that the king made
hirn aminister, a position from which he quickly rose to be prime minister,
attaining the power to strengthen the Prussian military and accomplish
what he had wanted all along: the humiliation of Austria and the unifica­
tion of Germany under Prussia's leadership.
Bismarck was certainly one of the cleverest statesman who ever lived,
a master of strategy and deception. No one suspected what he was up to in
this case. Had he announced his real intentions, arguing that it was better
to wait now and fight later, he would not have won the argument, since
most Prussians wanted war at that moment and mistakenly believed that
their army was superior to the Austrians. Had he played up to the king,
asking to be made a minister in exchange for supporting peace, he would
not have succeeded either: The king would have distrusted his ambition
and doubted his sincerity.
By being completely insincere and sending misleading signals, how­
ever, he deceived everyone, concealed his purpose, and attained every­
thing he wanted. Such is the power of hiding your intentions.
KEYS TO POWER
Most people are open books. They say what they feel, blurt out their opin­
ions at every opportunity, and constantly reveal their plans and intentions.
They do this for several reasons. First, it is easy and natural to always want
to talk about one's feelings and plans for the future. It takes effort to control
your tongue and monitor what you reveal. Second, many believe that by
being honest and open they are winning people's hearts and showing their
good nature.They are greatly deluded. Honesty is actually a blunt instru­
ment, which bloodies more than it cuts. Your honesty is likely to offend
people; it is much more prudent to tailor your words, telling people what
they want to hear rather than the coarse and ugly truth of what you feel or
think. More important, by being unabashedly open you make yourself so
predictable and familiar that it is almost impossible to respect or fear you,
and power will not accrue to a person who cannot inspire such emotions.
20 LAW 3

[PAGE 45]
If you yearn for power, quickly lay honesty aside, and train yourself in
the art of concealing your intentions. Master the art and you will always
have the upper hand. Basic to an ability to conceal one's intentions is a
simple truth about human nature: Our first instinct is to always trust ap­
pearances. We cannot go around doubting the reality of what we see and
hear-constantly imagining that appearances concealed something else
would exhaust and terrify uso This fact makes it relatively easy to conceal
one's intentions. Simply dangle an object you seem to desire, a goal you
seem to aim for, in front of people's eyes and they will take the appearance
for reality. Once their eyes foeus on the decoy, they will fail to notice what
you are really up to. In seduction, set up conflictin � signals, such as desire
and indifference, and you not only throw them off the scent, you inflame
their desire to possess you.
A tactic that is often effective in setting up a red herring is to appear to
support an idea or cause that is actually contrary to your own sentiments.
(Bismarck used this to great effect in his speech in 1850.) Most people will
believe you have experienced a change of heart, since it is so unusual to
play so lightly with something as emotional as one's opinions and values.
The same applies for any decoyed object of desire: Seem to want some­
thing in which you are actually not at all interested and your enemies will
be throWll off the scent, making all kinds of errors in their calculations.
During the War of the Spanish Succession in 1711, the Duke of Marl­
borough, head of the English army, wanted to destroy a key French fort,
because it proteeted a vital thoroughfare into Franee. Yet he knew that if he
destroyed it, the French would realize what he wanted-to advance down
that road. Instead, then, he merely captured the fort, and garrisoned it with
some of his troops, making it appear as if he wanted it for some purpose of
his OWl.l The French attaeked the fort and the duke let them reeapture it.
Once they had it back, though, they destroyed it, figuring that the duke had
wanted it for some important reason. Now that the fort was gone, the road
was unprotected, and Marlborough could easily march into France.
Use this tactie in the following manner: Hide your intentions not by
closing up (with the risk of appearing secretive, and making people suspi­
cious) but by talking endlessly about your desires and goals-just not yOUf
real ones. You will kill three birds with one stone: You appear friendly,
open, and trusting; you conceal YOUf intentions; and you send YOUf rivals
on time-consuming wild-goose ehases.
Another powerful tool in throwing people off the scent is false sineer­
ity. People easily mistake sincerity for honesty. Remember-their first in­
stinet is to trust appearances, and sinee they value honesty and want to
believe in the honesty of those around them, they will rarely doubt you or
see through YOUf aet. Seeming to believe what you say gives your words
great weight. This is how Iago deceived and destroyed Othello: Given the
depth of his emotions, the apparent sincerity of his coneems about Desde­
mona's supposed infidelity, how eould Othello distrust hirn? This is also
how the great con artist Yellow Kid Weil pulled the wool over suckers'
eyes: Seeming to believe so deeply in the deeoyed object he was dangling
LAW 3 21

[PAGE 46]
in front of them (a phony stock, a touted racehorse), he made its reality
hard to doubt. It is important, of course, not to go too far in this area. Sin­
cerity is a tricky tool: Appear overpassionate and you raise suspicions. Be
measured and believable or your ruse will seem the put-on that it iso
To make your false sincerity an effective weapon in concealing your
intentions, espouse a belief in honesty and forthrightness as important so­
cial values. Do this as publicly as possible. Emphasize your position on this
subject by occasionally divulging some heartfelt thought-though only one
that is actually meaningless or irrelevant, of course. Napoleon's minister
Talleyrand was a master at taking people into his confidence by revealing
some apparent secret. This feigned confidence-a decoy-would then
elicit areal confidence on the other person's part.

Deception is always the best strategy, but the best deceptions require a screen

The Yellow Kid had staked out Geezil as the perfect sucker long before he
set up the con. He knew the boxing-match scam would be the perfect ruse
to separate Geezil from his money quickly and definitively. But he also
knew that if he had begun by trying to interest Geezil in the boxing match,
he would have failed miserably. He had to conceal his intentions and
switch attention, create a smoke screen-in this case the sale of the lodge.
On the train ride and in the hotel room Geezil's mind had been com­
pletely occupied with the pending deal, the easy money, the chance to
hobnob with wealthy men. He had failed to notice that Gross was out of
shape and middle-aged at best. Such is the distracting power of a smoke
screen. Engrossed in the business deal, Geezil's attention was easily di­
verted to the boxing match, but only at a point when it was already too late
for hirn to notice the details that would have given Gross away. The match,
after al,l now depended on a bribe rather than on the boxer's physical condi­
tion. And Geezil was so distracted at the end by the illusion of the boxer's death
that he completely forgot about his money.

perfect smoke screen. Approach your mark with an idea that seems ordi­

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW 11
In the mid-1920s, the powerful warlords of Ethiopia were coming to the re­
alization that a young man of the nobility named Haile Selassie, also
known as Ras Tafari, was outcompeting them all and nearing the point
where he could prodaim hirnself their leader, unifying the country for the
first time in decades. Most of his rivals could not understand how this
wispy, , quiet, mild-mannered man had been able to take control. Yet in
LAW 3 25

[PAGE 50]
1927, Selassie was able to sumom n the warlords, one at a time, to come to
Addis Ababa to declare their loyalty and recognize bim as leader.
Some hurried, some hesitated, but only one, Dejazmach Balcha of
Sidamo, dared defy Selassie totally. A blustery man, Balcha was a great
warrior, and he considered the new leader weak and unworthy. He point­
edly stayed away from the capital. Finally Selassie, in his gentle but stern
way, commanded Balcha to come. The warlord decided to obey, but in
doing so he would turn the tables on this pretender to the Ethiopian
throne: He would come to Addis Ababa at his own speed, and with an
army of 10,000 men, a force large enough to defend hirnself, perhaps even
start a civil war. Stationing this formidable force in a valley three rniles
from the capital, he waited, as a king would. Selassie would have to come
to bim.
Selassie did indeed send emissaries, asking Balcha to attend an after­
noon banquet in his honor. But Balcha, no fool, knew history-he knew
that previous kings and lords of Ethiopia had used banquets as a trap.
Once he was there and full of drink, Selassie would have hirn arrested or
murdered. To signal his understanding of the situation, he agreed to come
to the banquet, but only if he could bring his personal bodyguard-600 of
bis best soldiers, all armed and ready to defend hirn and themselves. To
Balcha's surprise, Selassie answered with the utmost politeness that he
would be honored to play host to such warriors.
On the way to the banquet, Balcha warned his soldiers not to get
drunk and to be on their guard. When they arrived at the palace, Selassie
was his chargrnin best. He deferred to Balcha, treated hirn as if he desper­
ately needed his approval and cooperation. But Balcha refused to be
charmed, and he warned Selassie that if he did not return to his camp by
nightfall, his army had orders to attack the capital. Selassie reacted as if
hurt by his mistrust. Over the meal, when it came time for the traditional
singing of songs in honor of Ethiopia's leaders, he made a point of allowing
only songs honoring the warlord of Sidamo. It seemed to Balcha that Se­
lassie was scared, intimidated by this great warrior who could not be out­
witted. Sensing the change, Balcha believed that he would be the one to
call the shots in the days to come.
At the end of the afternoon, Balcha and his soldiers began their march
back to camp arnidst cheers and gun salutes. Looking back to the capital
over his shoulder, he planned his strategy-how his own soldiers would
march through the capital in triumph within weeks, and Selassie would be
put in his place, his place being either prison or death. When Balcha came
in sight of bis camp, however, he saw that something was terribly wrong.
Where before there had been colorful tents stretching as far as the eye
could see, now there was nothing, only smoke from doused fires. What
devil's magie was this?
A witness told Balcha what had happened. During the banquet, a large
army, commanded by an ally of Selassie's, had stolen up on Balcha's en­
campment by a side route he had not seen. This army had not come to
}l
fight, however: Knowing that Balcha would ave heard a noisy battle and

hurried back with his 600-man bodyguard, Selassie had ,armed his own
troops with baskets of gold and cash. They had sUITounded Balcha's army
and proceeded to purchase every last one of their weapons. Those who re­
fused were easily intimidated. Within a few hours, Balcha's entire force had
been disarmed and scattered in all directions.
Realizing his danger, Balcha decided to march south with his 600 sol­
diers to regroup, but the same army that had disarmed his soldiers blocked
his way. The other way out was to march on the capital, but Selas sie had set
a large army to defend it. Like a chess player, he had predicted Balcha's
moves, and had checkrnated hirn. For the first time in his life, Balcha sur­
rendered. To repent his sins of pride and ambition, he agreed to enter a
monastery.
Interpretation
Throughout Selassie's long reign, no one could quite figure hirn out.
Ethiopians like their leaders fierce, but Selassie, who wore the front of a
gentle, peace-loving man, lasted longer than any of them. Never angry or
impatient, he lured his victims with sweet smiles, lulling them with charm
and obsequiousness before he attacked. In the case of Balcha, Selassie
played on the man's wariness, his suspicion that the banquet was a trap-­
which in fact it was, but not the one he expected. Selassie's way of allaying
Balcha's fears-letting him bring his bodyguard to the banquet, giving hirn
top billing there, making him feel in control--created a thick smoke screen,
concealing the real action three miles away.
Remember: The paranoid and wary are often the easiest to deceive.
Win their trust in one area and you have a smoke screen that blinds their
view in another, letting you creep up and level them with a devastating
blow. A helpful or apparently honest ge sture, or one that implies the other
person's superiority-these are perfect diversionary devices.
Properly set up, the smoke screen is a weapon of great power. It en­
abled the gentle Selassie to totally destroy his enemy, without firing a single
bullet.
Do not underestimate the power of Tafari. He creeps
like a mouse hut he has jaws like a lion.

exactly what -Balcha would have expected from a weaker warlord.
LAW 3 27

[PAGE 52]
Once you have lulled your suckers' attention with the familiar, they
will not notice the deception being perpetrated behind their backs. This
derives from a simple truth: people can only focus on one thing at a time. It
is really too difficult for them to imagine that the bland and harmless per­
son they are dealing with is simultaneously setting up something else. The
grayer and more uniform the smoke in your smoke screen, the better it
conceals your intentions. In the decoy and red herring devices discussed in
Part I, you actively distract people; in the smoke screen, you lull your vic­
tims, drawing them into your web. Because it is so hypnotic, this is often
the best way of concealing your intentions.
The simplest form of smoke screen is facial expression. Behind abland,
unreadable exterior, all sorts of mayhem can be planned, without detection.
This is a weapon that the most powerful men in history have learned to per­
fect. It was said that no one could read Franklin D. Roosevelt's face. Baron
James Rothschild made a lifelong practice of disguising his real thoughts be­
hind bland smiles and nondescript looks. Stendhal wrote of Talleyrand,
"Never was a face less of a barometer." Henry Kissinger would bore his op­
ponents around the negotiating table to tears with his monotonous voice,
his blank look, his endless recitations of details; then, as their eyes glazed
over, he would suddenly hit them with a list of bold terms. Caught off­
guard, they would be easily intimidated. As one poker manual explains it,
"While playing his hand, the good player is seldom an actor. Instead he
practices abland behavior that minimizes readable patterns, frustrates and
confuses opponents, permits greater concentration."
An adaptable concept, the smoke screen can be practiced on a num­
ber of levels, all playing on the psychological principles of distraction and
misdirection. One of the most effective smoke screens is the noble gesture.
People want to believe apparently noble gestures are genuine, for the belief
is pleasant. They rarely notice how deceptive these gestures can be.
The art dealer Joseph Duveen was once confronted with a terrible prob­
lem. The millionaires who had paid so dearly for Duveen's paintings were
running out of wall space, and with inheritance taxes getting ever higher, it
seemed unlikely that they would keep buying. The solution was the National
Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., which Duveen helped create in 1937 by
getting Andrew Mellon to donate his collection to it. The National Gallery
was the perfect front for Duveen. In one gesture, his clients avoided taxes,
cleared wall space for new purchases, and reduced the number of paintings
on the market, maintaining the upward pressure on their prices. All this
while the donors created the appearance of being public benefactors.
Another effective smoke screen is the pattern, the establishment of a se­
ries of actions that seduce the victim into believing you will continue in the
same way. The pattern plays on the psychology of anticipation: Our behav­
ior conforms to patterns, or so we like to think.
In 1878 the American robber baronJay Gould created a company that
began to threaten the monopoly of the telegraph company Western Union.
The directors of Western Union decided to buy Gould's company up-
28 LAW 3

[PAGE 53]
they had to spend a hefty sum, but they figured they had managed to rid
themselves of an irritating competitor. A few months later, though, Gould
was it at again, complaining he had been treated unfairly. He started up a
second company to compete with Western Union and its new acquisition.
The same thing happened again: Western Union bought hirn out to shut
hirn up. Soon the pattern began for the third time, but now Gould went for
the jugular: He suddenly staged a bloody takeover struggle and managed
to gain complete control of Western Union. He had established a pattern
that had tricked the company's directors into thinking his goal was to be
bought out at a handsome rate. Once they paid hirn off, they relaxed and
failed to notice that he was actually playing for higher stakes. The pattern is
powerful in that it deceives the other person into expecting the opposite of
what you are really doing.
Another psychological weakness on which to construct a smoke screen
is the tendency to mistake appearances for reality-the feeling that if some­
one seems to belong to your group, their belonging must be real. This habit
makes the seamless blend a very effective front. The trick is simple: You sim­
ply blend in with those around you. The better you blend, the less suspi­
cious you become. During the Cold War of the 1950s and '60s, as is now
notorious, a slew of British civil servants passed secrets to the Soviets. They
went undetected for years because they were apparently decent chaps, had
gone to all the right schools, and fit the old-boy network perfectly. Blend­
ing in is the perfect smoke screen for spying. The better you do it, the bet­
ter you can conceal your intentions.
Remember: It takes patience and humility to dull your brilliant colors,
to put on the mask of the inconspicuous. Do not despair at having to wear
such abland mask-it is often your unreadability that draws people to you
and makes you appear a person of power.

Authority: Have you ever heard of a skillful general, who intends to
surprise a citadel, announcing his plan to his enemy? Conceal your
purpose and hide your progress; do not disclose the extent of your
designs until they cannot be opposed, until the combat is over. Win
the victory before you declare the war. In a word, imitate those war­
like people whose designs are not known except by the ravaged coun­
try through which they have passed. (Ninon de Lenclos, 1623-1706)

[PAGE 54]
REVERSAL
No smoke screen, red herring, false sincerity, or any other diversionary de­
vice will succeed in concealing your intentions if you already have an es­
tablished reputation for deception. And as you get older and achieve
success, it often becomes increasingly difficult to disguise your cunning.
Everyone knows you practice deception; persist in playing naive and you
run the risk of seeming the rankest hypocrite, which will severely limit
your room to maneuver .Ins uchc ases it is better to own up, to appear the
honest rogue, or, better, the repentant rogue .Not only will you be admired
for yourfr ankness, but, most wonderful and strange of all, you will be able
to continue your stratagems.
As P. T. Barnum, the nineteenth-century king of humbuggery, grew
older, he learned to embrace his reputation as a grand deceiver . At one
point he organized a buffalo hunt inN ew Jersey, complete with Indians
and a few imported buffalo. He publicized the hunt as genuine, but it came
off as soc ompletely fake that the crowd, instead of getting angry and ask­
ing for their money back, was greatly amused. They knew Barnum pulled
tricks all the time; that was the secret of his success, and they loved him for
it. Learning a lesson from this affair, Barnums topped concealing all of his
devices, even revealing his deceptions in a tell-all autobiography. As
Kierkegaard wrote, "The world wants to be deceived."
Finally, although it is wiser to divert attention from your purposes by
presenting a bland, familiar exterior, there are times when the colorful,
conspicuous gesture is the right diversionary tactic. The great charlatan
mountebanks of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe used humor
and entertainment to deceive their audiences. Dazzled by a great show, the
public would not notice the charlatans' real intentions.T hus the star charla­
tan himself would appear in town in a night-black coach drawn by black
horses. Clowns, tightrope walkers, and star entertainers would accompany
him, pulling people in to his demonstrations of elixirs and quack potions.
The charlatan made entertainment seem like the business of the day; the
business of the day was actually the sale of the elixirs and quack potions.
Spectacle and entertainment, clearly, are excellent devices to conceal
your intentions, but they cannot be used indefinitely. The public grows
tired and suspicious, and eventually catches on to the trick. And indeed the
charlatans had to move quickly from town to town, before word spread
that the potions were useless and the entertainment a trick. Powerful peo­
pIe with bland exteriors, on the other hand-the Talleyrands, the Roth­
schilds, the Selassies-can practice their deceptions in the same place
throughout their lifetimes. Their act never wears thin, and rarely causes
suspicion. The colorful smoke screen should be used cautiously, then, and
only when the occasion is right .

SIR WAU'ER RALE.IGH, The ministers and courtiers would never hear another word on this
1554-1618 subject from the king-they would simply see the result, weeks later, when
he would come to a decision and act. He would never bother to consult
them on the matter again.
Interpretation
Louis XIV was a man of very few words. His most famous remark is
"L'Uat, c'est moi" ("I am the state"); nothing could be more pithy yet more
eloquent. His infamous "I shall see" was one of several extremely short
phrases that he would apply to all manner of requests.
Louis was not always this way; as a young man he was known for talk­
ing at length, delighting in his own eloquence. His later tacitumity was self­
imposed, an act, a mask he used to keep everybody below him off-balance.
No one knew exactly where he stood, or could predict bis reactions. No
one could try to deceive him by saying what they thought he wanted to
hear, because no one knew what he wanted to hear. As they talked on and
on to the silent Louis, they revealed more and more about themselves, in­
formation he would later use against them to great effect.
In the end, Louis's silence kept those around him terrified and under
his thumb. It was one of the foundations of his power. As Saint-Simon
wrote, "No one knew as weIl as he how to seIl his words, his smile, even his
glances. Everything in him was valuable because he created differences,
and his majesty was enhanced by the sparseness ofhis words."
It is even more damagingfor a minister to say foolish things than to do them.
Cardinal de Retz, 1613-1679
KEYS TO POWER
Power is in many ways agame of appearances, and when you say less than
necessary, you inevitably appear greater and more powerful than you are.
YOUf silence will make other people uncomfortable. Humans are machines
of interpretation and explanation; they have to know what you are think­
ing. When you carefully control what you reveal, they cannot pierce yOUf
intentions or your meaning.
34 LAW 4

[PAGE 59]
YOUf short answers and silences will put them on the defensive, and
they will jump in, nervously filling the silence with all kinds of comments
that will reveal valuable information about them and their weaknesses.
They willleave a meeting with you feeling as if they had been robbed, and
they will go horne and ponder YOUf every word. This extra attention to
YOUf brief comments will only add to your power.
Saying less than necessary is not for kings and statesmen only. In most
areas of life, the less you say, the more profound and mysterious you ap­
pear. As a young man, the artist Andy Warhol had the revelation that it was
generally impossible to get people to do what you wanted them to do by
talking to them. They would turn against you, subvert YOUf wishes, disobey
you out of sheer perversity. He once told a friend, "I leamed that you actu­
ally have more power when you shut up."
In his later life Warhol employed this strategy with great success. His
interviews were exercises in oracular speech: He would say something
vague and ambiguous, and the interviewer would twist in circles trying to
figure it out, imagining there was something prafound behind his often
meaningless phrases. Warhol rarely talked ab out his work; he let others do
the interpreting. He claimed to have leamed this technique from that mas­
ter of enigma Marcel Duchamp, another twentieth-century artist who real­
ized early on that the less he said about his work, the more people talked
about it. And the more they talked, the more valuable his work became.
By saying less than necessary you create the appearance of meaning
and power. Also, the less you say, the less risk you run of saying something
foolish, even dangeraus. In 1825 a new czar, Nicholas I, ascended the
throne of Russia. A rebellion immediately broke out, led by liberals de­
manding that the country modernize-that its industries and civil struc­
tures catch up with the rest of Europe. Brutally crushing this rebellion (the
Decembrist Uprising), Nicholas I sentenced one of its leaders, Kondraty
Ryleyev, to death. On the day of the execution Ryleyev stood on the gal­
lows, the noose around his neck. The trapdoor opened-but as Ryleyev
dangled, the rape brake, dashing hirn to the ground. At the time, events
like this were considered signs of providence or heavenly will, and a man
saved from execution this way was usually pardoned. As Ryleyev got to his
feet, bruised and dirtied but believing his neck had been saved, he called
out to the crowd, "You see, in Russia they don't know how to do anything
properly, not even how to make rape!"
A messenger immediately went to the Winter Palace with news of the
failed hanging. Vexed by this disappointing turnabout, Nicholas I never­
theless began to sign the pardon. But then: "Did Ryleyev say anything after
this miracle?" the czar asked the messenger. "Sire," the messenger replied,
"he said that in Russia they don't even know how to make rope."
"In that case," said the Czar, "let us prove the contrary," and he tore
up the pardon. The next day Ryleyev was hanged again. This time the
rope did not break.
Learn the lesson: Once the words are out, you cannot take them back.
Keep them under control. Be particularly careful with sarcasm: The mo-

REVERSAL
There are times when it is unwise to be silent. Silence can arouse suspicion
and even insecurity, especially in your superiors; a vague or ambiguous
comment can open you up to interpretations you had not bargained for. Si­
lence and saying less than necessary must be practiced with caution, then,
and in the right situations. It is occasionally wiser to imitate the court jester,
who plays the fool but knows he is smarter than the king. He talks and talks
and entertains, and no one suspects that he is more than just a foo1.
Also, words can sometimes act as a kind of smoke screen for any de­
ception you might practice. By bending your listener's ear with talk, you
can distract and mesmerize them; the more you talk, in fact, the less suspi­
cious of you they become. The verbose are not perceived as sly and ma­
nipulative but as helpless and unsophisticated. This is the reverse of the
silent policy employed by the powerful: By talking more, and making
yourself appear weaker and less intelligent than your mark, you can prac­
tice deception with greater ease.

KEYS TO POWER
The people around us, even OUf dosest friends, will always to some extent
remain mysterious and unfathomable. Their eharaeters have seeret reeesses
that they never reveal. The unknowableness of other people eould prove
disturbing if we thought about it long enough, sinee it would make it im­
possible for us really to judge other people. So we prefer to ignore this fact,
and to judge people on their appearanees, on what is most visible to OUf
eyes-clothes, gestures, words, aetions. In the social realm, appearanees are
the barometer of almost all of OUf judgments, and you must never be mis­
led into believing otherwise. One false slip, one awkward or sudden change
in YOUf appearanee, ean prove disastrous.
40 LAW 5

[PAGE 65]
This is the reason for the supreme importance of making and main­
taining areputation that is of your own creation.
That reputation will protect you in the dangerous game of appear­
ances, distracting the probing eyes of others from knowing what you are
really like, and giving you a degree of control over how the world judges
you-a powerful position to be in. Reputation has a power like magic:
With one stroke of its wand, it can double your strength. It can also send
people scurrying away from you. Whether the exact same deeds appear
brilliant or dreadful can depend entirely on the reputation of the doer.
In the aneient Chinese court of the Wei kingdom there was a man
named Mi Tzu-hsia who had areputation for supreme eivility and graeious­
ness. He became the mler's favorite. It was a law in Wei that "whoever
rides secretly in the mler's coach shall have his feet cut off," but when Mi
Tzu-hsia's mother fell ill, he used the royal coach to visit her, pretending
that the mler had given hirn permission. When the mler found out, he said,
"How dutiful is Mi Tzu-hsia! For his mother's sake he even forgot that he
was committing a crime making hirn liable to lose his feet!"
Another time the two of them took a stroll in an orchard. Mi Tzu-hsia
began eating a peach that he could not finish, and he gave the mler the
other half to eat. The mler remarked, "You love me so much that you would
even forget your own saliva taste and let me eat the rest of the peach!"
Later, however, envious fellow courtiers, spreading word that Mi Tzu­
hsia was actually devious and arrogant, succeeded in damaging his reputa­
tion; the mler came to see his actions in a new light. "This fellow once rode
in my coach under pretense of my order," he told the courtiers angrily,
"and another time he gave me a half-eaten peach." For the same actions
that had charmed the mler when he was the favorite, Mi Tzu-hsia now had
to suffer the penalties. The fate of his feet depended solelyon the strength
of his reputation.
In the beginning, you must work to establish areputation for one out­
standing quality, whether generosity or honesty or cunning. This quality
sets you apart and gets other people to talk ab out you. You then make your
reputation known to as many people as possible (subtly, though; take care
to build slowly, and with a firm foundation), and watch as it spreads like
wildfire.
A solid reputation increases your presence and exaggerates your
strengths without your having to spend much energy. It can also create an
aura around you that will instill respect, even fear. In the fighting in the
North African desert during World War II, the German general Erwin
Rommel had areputation for cunning and for deceptive maneuvering that
struck terror into everyone who faced hirn. Even when his forces were de­
pleted, and when British tanks outnumbered his by five to one, entire eities
would be evacuated at the news of his approach.
As they say, your reputation inevitably precedes you, and if it inspires
respect, a lot of your work is done for you before you arrive on the scene,
or utter a single word.
Your success seems destined by your past triumphs. Much of the suc-
LAW 5 41

[PAGE 66]
cess of Henry Kissinger's shuttle diplomacy rested on bis reputation for
ironing out differences; no one wanted to be seen as so unreasonable that
Kissinger could not sway hirn. A peace treaty seemed a fait accompli as
soon as Kissinger's name became involved in the negotiations.
Make your reputation simple and base it on one sterling quality. This
single quality--efficiency, say, or seductiveness-becomes a kind of calling
card that announces your presence and places others under aspeIl. A repu­
tation for honesty will allow you to practice all manner of deception.
Casanova used bis reputation as a great seducer to pave the way for his fu­
ture conquests; women who had heard of his powers became immensely
curious, and wanted to discover for themselves what had made hirn so ro­
mantically successful.
Perhaps you have already stained your reputation, so that you are pre­
vented from establishing a new one. In such cases it is wise to associate
with someone whose image counteracts your own, using their good name
to whitewash and elevate yours. It is hard, for example, to erase a reputa­
tion for dishonesty by yourself; but a paragon of honesty can help. When
P. T. Barnum wanted to dean up areputation for promoting vulgar enter­
tainment, he brought the singer Jenny Lind over from Europe. She had a
stellar, high-dass reputation, and the American tour Bamum sponsored for
her greatly enhanced his own image. Similarly the great robber barons of
nineteenth-century America were long unable to rid themselves of a repu­
tation for cruelty and mean-spiritedness. Only when they began collecting
art, so that the names of Morgan and Frick became permanently associated
with those of da Vinci and Rembrandt, were they able to soften their un­
pleasant image.
Reputation is a treasure to be carefully collected and hoarded. Espe­
cially when you are first establishing it, you must protect it strictly, antici­
pating all attacks on it. Once it is solid, do not let yourself get angry or
defensive at the slanderous comments of your enemies-that reveals inse­
curity, not confidence in your reputation. Take the high road instead, and
never appear desperate in your self-defense. On the other hand, an attack
on another man's reputation is a potent weapon, particularly when you
have less power than he does. He has much more to lose in such a battle,
and your own thus-far-small reputation gives hirn a small target when he
tries to return your fire. Bamum used such campaigns to great effect in his
early career. But this tactic must be practiced with skill; you must not seem
to engage in petty vengeance. If you do not break your enemy's reputation
deverly, you will inadvertently ruin your own.
Thomas Edison, considered the inventor who hamessed electricity,
believed that a workable system would have to be based on direct cur­
rent (DC). When the Serbian scientist Nikola Tesla appeared to have suc­
ceeded in creating a system based on alternating current (AC), Edison was
furious. He determined to ruin Tesla's reputation, by making the public be­
lieve that the AC system was inherently unsafe, and Tesla irresponsible in
promoting it.
To this end he captured all kinds of household pets and electrocuted
42 LAW 5

[PAGE 67]
them to death with an AC current. When this wasn't enough, in 1890 he got
New York State prison authorities to organize the world's first execution by
electrocution, using an AC current. Eut Edison's electrocution experiments
had all been with small creatures; the charge was too weak, and the man
was only half killed. In perhaps the country's cruelest state-authorized exe­
cution, the procedure had to be repeated. It was an awful spectacle.
Although, in the long run, it is Edison's name that has survived, at the
time his campaign damaged his own reputation more than Tesla's. He
backed off. The lesson is simple-never go too far in attacks like these, for
that will draw more attention to your own vengefulness than to the person
you are slandering. When your own reputation is solid, use subtIer tactics,
such as satire and ridicule, to weaken YOUf opponent while making you out
as a charming rogue. The mighty lion toys with the mouse that crosses his
path-any other reaction would mar his fearsome reputation.

which appears to rest on the opinions of many fosters a certain unshak­
able belief in a man's worth which is then easily strengthened in minds
already thus disposed and prepared. (Baldassare Castiglione, 1478-1529)
REVERSAL
There is no possible Reversal. Reputation is critical; there are no excep­
tions to this law. Perhaps, not caring what others think of you, you gain a
reputation for insolence and arrogance, but that can be a valuable image in
itself-Oscar Wilde used it to great advantage. Since we must live in soci­
ety and must depend on the opinions of others, there is nothing to be
gained by neglecting your reputation. By not caring how you are per­
ceived, you let others decide this for you. Be the master of your fate, and
also of your reputation.

or positive-was the main ingredient of his success. The worst fate in the
world for a man who yearns farne, glory, and, of course, power is to be

Raidassare Castiglione, 1478-1529
KEYS TO POWER
Burning more brightly than those around you is a skill that no one is born
with. You have to team to attract attention, "as surely as the lodestone at­
tracts iron." At the start of your career, you must attach your narne and rep­
utation to a quality, an image, that sets you apart from other people. This
image can be something like a characteristic style of dress, or a personality
quirk that amuses people and gets talked about. Once the image is estab­
lished, you have an appearance, a place in the sky for your star.
It is a common mistake to imagine that this peculiar appearance of
yours should not be controversial, that to be attacked is somehow bad.
Nothing could be further from the truth. To avoid being a flash in the pan,
and having your notoriety eclipsed by another, you must not discriminate
between different types of attention; in the end, every kind will work in
your favor. Barnum, we have seen, welcomed personal attacks and feIt
no need to defend hirnself. He deliberately courted the image of being a
humbug.
LAW 6 47

[PAGE 72]
The court of Louis XIV contained many talented writers, artists, great
beauties, and men and women of impeccable virtue, but no one was more
talked about than the singular Duc de Lauzun. The duke was short, almost
dwarfish, and he was prone to the most insolent kinds of behavior-he
slept with the king's mistress, and openly insulted not only other courtiers
but the king hirnself. Louis, however, was so beguiled by the duke's eccen­
tricities that he could not bear his absences from the court. It was simple:
The strangeness of the duke's character attracted attention. Once people
were enthralled by hirn, they wanted hirn around at any cost.
Society craves larger-than-life figures, people who stand above the
general mediocrity. Never be afraid, then, of the qualities that set you apart
and draw attention to you. Court controversy, even scandal. It is better to
be attacked, even slandered, than ignored. All professions are ruled by this
law, and all professionals must have a bit of the showman about them.
The great scientist Thomas Edison knew that to raise money he had to
remain in the public eye at any cost. Almost as important as the inventions
themselves was how he presented them to the public and courted attention.
Edison would design visually dazzling experiments to display his dis­
coveries with electricity. He would talk of future inventions that seemed
fantastic at the time-robots, and machines that could photograph
thought-and that he had no intention of wasting his energy on, but that
made the public talk about hirn. He did everything he could to make sure
that he received more attention than his great riyal Nikola Tesla, who may
actually have been more brilliant than he was but whose name was far less
known. In 1915, it was rumored that Edison and Tesla would be joint recip­
ients of that year's Nobel Prize in physics. The prize was eventually given to
a pair of English physicists; only later was it discovered that the prize com­
mittee had actually approached Edison, but he had tumed them down, re­
fusing to share the prize with Tesla. By that time his fame was more seeure
than Tesla's, and he thought it better to refuse the honor than to allow his
riyal the attention that would have come even from sharing the prize.
If you find yourself in a lowly position that offers little opportunity for
you to draw attention, an effective trick is to attack the most visible, most
famous, most powerful person you can find. When Pietro Aretino, a young
Roman servant boy of the early sixteenth century, wanted to get attention
as a writer of verses, he decided to publish aseries of satirical poems ridi­
culing the pope and his affection for a pet elephant. The attack put Aretino
in the public eye immediately. A slanderous attack on a person in a posi­
tion of power would have a similar effect. Remember, however, to use such
tactics sparingly after you have the public's attention, when the act can
wear thin.
Once in the limelight you must constantly renew it by adapting and
varying your method of courting attention. If you don't, the public will
grow tired, will take you for granted, and will move on to a newer star. The
game requires constant vigilance and creativity. Pablo Picasso never al­
lowed hirnself to fade into the background; if his name became too at-

tached to a particular style, he would deliberately upset the public with a
new series of paintings that went against all expectations. Better to create
something ugly and disturbing, he believed, than to let viewers grow too fa­
miliar with his work. Understand: People feel superior to the person whose
actions they can predict. If you show them who is in control by playing
againsttheir expectations, you both gain their respect and tighten your hold
on their fleeting attention.

PART II: CREATE AN AIR OF MYSTERY
In a world growing increasingly banal and familiar, what seems enig­
matic instantly draws attention. Never make it too clear what you are
doing or about to do. Do not show all your cards. An air of mystery height­
ens your presence; it also creates anticipation-everyone will be watching
you to see what happens next. Use mystery to beguile, seduce, even frighten.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Beginning in 1905, rumors started to spread throughout Paris of a young
Oriental girl who danced in a private horne, wrapped in veils that she grad­
ually discarded. A local journalist who had seen her dancing reported that
"a woman from the Far East had come to Europe laden with perfume and
jewels, to introduce some of the richness of the Oriental colour and life into
the satiated society of European cities." Soon everyone knew the dancer's
name: Mata Hari.
Early that year, in the winter, small and select audiences would gather
in a salon filled with Indian statues and other relics while an orchestra
played music inspired by Hindu andJavanese melodies. Mter keeping the
audience waiting and wondering, Mata Hari would suddenly appear, in a
startling costume: a white cotton brassiere coyered with Indian-type jewels;
jeweled bands at the waist supporting a sarong that revealed as much as it
concealed; bracelets up the arms. Then Mata Hari would dance, in a style
no one in France had seen before, her whole body swaying as if she were in
a trance. She told her excited and curious audience that her dances told
stories from Indian mythology and Javanese folktales. Soon the cream of
Paris, and ambassadors from far-off lands, were competing for invitations
to the salon, where it was rumored that Mata Hari was actually performing
sacred dances in the nude.
The public wanted to know more about her. She told journalists that
she was actually Dutch in origin, but had grown up on the island of Java.
She would also talk about time spent in India, how she had leamed sacred
Hindu dances there, and how Indian women "can shoot straight, ride
horseback, and are capable of doing logarithms and talk philosophy." By
the summer of 1905, although few Parisians had actually seen Mata Hari
dance, her name was on everyone's lips.
As Mata Hari gave more interviews, the story of her origins kept
changing: She had grown up in India, her grandmother was the daughter
of a Javanese princess, she had lived on the island of Sumatra where she
had spent her time "horseback riding, gun in hand, and risking her life."
No one knew anything certain about her, but journalists did not mind these
changes in her biography. They compared her to an Indian goddess, a
creature from the pages of Baudelaire-w- hatever their imagination wanted
to see in this mysterious woman from the East.
In August of 1905, Mata Hari performed for the first time in public.
50 LAW 6

[PAGE 75]
Crowds thronging to see her on opening night caused a riot. She had now
become a cult figure, spawning many imitations. One reviewer wrote,
"Mata Hari personifies all the poetry of India, its mysticism, its voluptuous­
ness, its hypnotizing charm." Another noted, "If India possesses such unex­
pected treasures, then all Frenchmen will emigrate to the shores of the
Ganges."
Soon the fame of Mata Hari and her sacred Indian dances spread be­
yond Paris. She was invited to Berlin, Vienna, Milan. Over the next few
years she performed throughout Europe, mixed with the highest social cir­
eIes, and eamed an income that gave her an independence rarely enjoyed
by a woman of the period. Then, near the end of World War I, she was ar­
rested in France, tried, convicted, and finally executed as a German spy.
Only during the trial did the truth come out: Mata Hari was not from Java
or India, had not grown up in the Orient, did not have a drop of Eastem
blood in her body. Her real name was Margaretha Zelle, and she came
from the stolid northem province of Friesland, Holland.
Interpretation
When Margaretha Zelle arrived in Paris, in 1904, she had half a franc in
her pocket. She was one of the thousands of beautiful young girls who
flocked to Paris every year, taking work as artists' models, nightclub
dancers, or vaudeville performers at the Folies Bergere. Mter a few years
they would inevitably be replaced by younger girls, and would often end
up on the streets, tuming to prostitution, or else retuming to the town they
came from, older and chastened.
Zelle had higher ambitions. She had no dance experience and had
never performed in the theater, but as a young girl she had traveled with
her family and had witnessed local dances in Java and Sumatra. Zelle
eIearly understood that what was important in her act was not the dance it­
self, or even her face or figure, but her ability to create an air of mystery
about herself. The mystery she created lay not just in her dancing, or her
costumes, or the stories she would tell, or her endless lies about her origins;
it lay in an atmosphere enveloping everything she did. There was nothing
you could say for sure about her-she was always changing, always sur­
prising her audience with new costumes, new dances, new stories. This air
of mystery left the public always wanting to know more, always wondering
about her next move. Mata Hari was no more beautiful than many of the
other young girls who came to Paris, and she was not a particularly good
dancer. What separated her from the mass, what attracted and held the
public's attention and made her famous and wealthy, was her mystery.
People are enthralled by mystery; because it invites constant interpreta­
tion, they never tire of it. The mysterious cannot be grasped. And what
cannot be seized and consumed creates power.
LAW 6 51

[PAGE 76]
KEYS TO POWER
In the past, the world was filled with the terrifying and unknowable­
diseases, disasters, capricious despots, the mystery of death itself. What we
could not understand we reimagined as myths and spirits. Over the cen­
turies, though, we have managed, through science and reason, to illumi­
nate the darkness; what was mysterious and forbidding has grown familiar
and comfortable. Yet this light has a price: in a world that is ever more
banal, that has had its mystery and myth squeezed out of it, we secretly
crave enigmas, people or things that cannot be instantly interpreted,
seized, and consumed.
That is the power of the mysterious: It invites layers of interpretation,
excites our imagination, seduces us into believing that it conceals some­
thing marvelous. The world has become so familiar and its inhabitants so
predictable that what wraps itself in mystery will almost always draw the
limelight to it and make us watch it.
Do not imagine that to create an air of mystery you have to be grand
and awe-inspiring. Mystery that is woven into your day-to-day demeanor,
and is subtle, has that much more power to fascinate and attract attention.
Remember: Most people are upfront, can be read like an open book, take
little care to control their words or image, and are hopelessly predictable.
By simply holding back, keeping silent, occasionally uttering ambiguous
phrases, deliberately appearing inconsistent, and acting odd in the subtlest
of ways, you will emanate an aura of mystery. The people around you will
then magnify that aura by constantly trying to interpret you.
Both artists and con artists understand the vital link between being
mysterious and attracting interest. Count Victor Lustig, the aristocrat of
swindlers, played the game to perfection. He was always doing things that
were different, or seemed to make no sense. He would show up at the best
hotels in a limo driven by a Japanese chauffeur; no one had ever seen a
Japanese chauffeur before, so this seemed exotic and strange. Lustig would
dress in the most expensive clothing, but always with something-a medal,
a flower, an armband-out of place, at least in conventional terms. This
was seen not as tasteless but as odd and intriguing. In hotels he would be
seen receiving telegrams at all hours, one after the other, brought to hirn by
his Japanese chauffeur-telegrams he would tear up with utter noncha­
lance. (In fact they were fakes, completely blank.) He would sit alone in the
dining room, reading a large and impressive-Iooking book, smiling at peo­
pIe yet remaining aloof. Within a few days, of course, the entire hotel
would be abuzz with interest in this strange man.
All this attention allowed Lustig to lure suckers in with ease. They
would beg for his confidence and his company. Everyone wanted to be
seen with this mysterious aristocrat. And in the presence of this distracting
enigma, they wouldn't even notice that they were being robbed blind.
An air of mystery can make the mediocre appear intelligent and pro­
found. It made Mata Hari, a woman of average appearance and intelli­
gence, seem like a goddess, and her dancing divinely inspired. An air of
52 LAW 6

[PAGE 77]
mystery about an artist makes his or her artwork immediately more intrigu­
ing, a trick Marcel Duchamp played to great effect. It is all very easy to
do-say little about your work, tease and titillate with alluring, even contra­
dictory comments, then stand back and let others try to make sense of it all.
Mysterious people put others in a kind of inferior position-that of try­
ing to figure them out. To degrees that they can control, they also elicit the
fear surrounding anything uncertain or unknown. All great leaders know
that an aura of mystery draws attention to them and creates an intimidating
presence. Mao Tse-tung, for example, cleverly cultivated an enigmatic
image; he had no worries about seeming inconsistent or contradicting him­
self-the very contradictoriness of his actions and words meant that he al­
ways had the upper hand. No one, not even his own wife, ever feIt they
understood hirn, and he therefore seemed larger than life. This also meant
that the public paid constant attention to hirn, ever anxious to witness his
nextmove.
If your social position prevents you from completely wrapping your
actions in mystery, you must at least learn to make yourself less obvious.
Every now and then, act in a way that does not mesh with other people's
perception of you. This way you keep those around you on the defensive,
eliciting the kind of attention that makes you powerful. Done right, the cre­
ation of enigma can also draw the kind of attention that strikes terror into
your enemy.
During the Second Punic War (219-202 B.C.), the great Carthaginian
general Hannibal was wreaking havoc in his march on Rome. Hannibal
was known for his cleverness and duplicity.
Under his leadership Carthage's army, though smaller than those of
the Romans, had constantly outmaneuvered them. On one occasion,
though, Hannibal's scouts made a horrible blunder, leading his troops into
a marshy terrain with the sea at their back. The Roman army blocked the
mountain passes that led inland, and its general, Fabius, was ecstatic-at
last he had Hannibal trapped. Posting his best sentries on the passes, he
worked on a plan to destroy Hannibal's forces. But in the middle of the
night, the sentries looked down to see a mysterious sight: A huge pro ces­
sion of lights was heading up the mountain. Thousands and thousands of
lights. If this was Hannibal's army, it had suddenly grown a hundredfold.
The sentries argued heatedly about what this could mean: Reinforce­
ments from the sea? Troops that had been hidden in the area? Ghosts? No
explanation made sense.
As they watched, fires broke out all over the mountain, and a horrible
noise drifted up to them from below, like the blowing of a million horns.
Demons, they thought. The sentries, the bravest and most sensible in the
Roman army, fled their posts in a panic.
By the next day, Hannibal had escaped from the marshland. What was
his trick? Had he really cOI�ured up demons? Actually what he had done
was order bundles of twigs to be fastened to the horns of the thousands of
oxen that traveled with his troops as beasts of burden. The twigs were then
LAW 6 53

[PAGE 78]
lit, giving the impression of the torches of a vast army heading up the
mountain. When the flarnes burned down to the oxen's skin, they stam­
peded in all directions, bellowing like mad and setting fires all over the
mountainside. The key to this device's success was not the torches, the
fires, or the noises in themselves, however, but the fact that Hannibal had
created a puzzle that captivated the sentries' attention and gradually terri­
fied them. From the mountaintop there was no way to explain this bizarre
sight. If the sentries could have explained it they would have stayed at their
posts.
If you find yourself trapped, cornered, and on the defensive in some
situation, try a simple experiment: Do something that cannot be easily ex­
plained or interpreted. Choose a simple action, but carry it out in a way
that unsettles your opponent, a way with many possible interpretations,
making your intentions obscure. Don't just be unpredictable (although this
tactic too can be successful-see Law 17); like Hannibal, create a scene that
cannot be read. There will seem to be no method to your madness, no
rhyme or reason, no single explanation. If you do this right, you will in­
spire fear and trembling and the sentries will abandon their posts. Call it
the "feigned madness of Harnlet" tactic, for Harnlet uses it to great effect in
Shakespeare's play, frightening his stepfather Claudius through the mys­
tery of his behavior. The mysterious makes your forces seem larger, your
power more terrifying.

REVERSAL
In the beginning of your rise to the top, you must attraet attention at all
cost, but as you rise higher you must constantly adapt. Never wear the pub­
lic out with the same tactic. An air of mystery works wonders for those who
need to develop an aura of power and get themselves noticed, but it must
seem measured and under control. Mata Hari went too far with her fabri­
cations; although the accusation that she was a spy was false, at the time it
was a reasonable presumption because all her lies made her seem suspi­
cious and nefarious. Do not let your air of mystery be slowly transformed
into a reputation for deceit. The mystery you create must seem a game,
playful and unthreatening. Recognize when it goes too far, and puH back.
There are times when the need for attention must be deferred, and
when scandal and notoriety are the last things you want to create. The at­
tention you attraet must never offend or challenge the reputation of those
above you-not, at any rate, if they are secure. You will seem not only pal­
try but desperate by comparison. There is an art to knowing when to draw
notice and when to withdraw.
Lola Montez was one of the great practitioners of the art of attracting
attention. She managed to rise from a middle-class lrish background to
being the lover of Franz Liszt and then the mistress and political adviser of
King Ludwig of Bavaria. In her later years, though, she lost her sense of
proportion.
In London in 1850 there was to be a performance of Shakespeare's
Macbeth featuring the greatest actor of the time, Charles John Kean. Every­
one of consequence in English society was to be there; it was rumored that
even Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were to make a public appearance.
The custom of the period demanded that everyone be seated before the
queen arrived. So the audience got there a little early, and when the queen
entered her royal box, they observed the convention of standing up and
applauding her. The royal couple waited, then bowed. Everyone sat down
and the lights were dimmed. Then, suddenly, all eyes turned to a box op­
posite Queen Victoria's: A woman appeared from the shadows, taking her
seat later than the queen. It was Lola Montez. She wore a diamond tiara on
her dark hair and a long fur coat over her shoulders. People whispered in
amazement as the ermine cloak was dropped to reveal a low-necked gown
of crimson velvet. By turning their heads, the audience could see that the
royal couple deliberately avoided looking at Lola's box. They foHowed
Victoria's example, and for the rest of the evening Lola Montez was ig­
nored. Mter that evening no one in fashionable society dared to be seen
with her. All her magnetic powers were reversed. People would flee her
sight. Her future in England was finished.
Never appear overly greedy for attention, then, for it signals insecurity,
and insecurity drives power away. Understand that there are times when it
is not in your interest to be the center of attention. When in the presence of
a king or queen, for instance, or the equivalent thereof, bow and retreat to
the shadows; never compete.

covered the location of the Incan empire, a soldier in his own army, Fran­

take what Balboa had spent so many years trying to find.
The other pole is that of the artist Peter Paul Rubens, who, late in his
career, found hirnself deluged with requests for paintings. He created a sys­
tem: In his large studio he employed dozens of outstanding painters, one
specializing in robes, another in backgrounds, and so on. He created a vast
production line in which a large number of canvases would be worked on
at the same time. When an important dient visited the studio, Rubens
would shoo his hired painters out for the day. While the dient watched
from a balcony, Rubens would work at an incredible pace, with unbeliev­
able energy. The dient would leave in awe of this prodigious man, who
could paint so many masterpieces in so short a time.
This is the essence of the Law: Leam to get others to do the work for
you while you take the credit, and you appear to be of godlike strength and
power. If you think it important to do all the work yourself, you will never
get far, and you will suffer the fate of the Balboas and Teslas of the world.
Find people with the skills and creativity you lack. Either hire them, while
putting your own name on top of theirs, or find a way to take their work
and make it your own. Their creativity thus becomes yours, and you seem
a genius to the world.
There is another application of this law that does not require the para­
sitic use of your contemporaries' labor: Use the past, a vast storehouse of

knowledge and wisdom. Isaac Newton called this "standing on the shoul­
ders of giants." He meant that in making his discoveries he had built on the
achievements of others. A great part of his aura of genius, he knew, was at­
tributable to his shrewd ability to make the most of the insights of ancient,
medieval, and Renaissance scientists. Shakespeare borrowed plots, charac­
terizations, and even dialogue from Plutarch, among other writers, for he
knew that nobody surpassed Plutarch in the writing of subtle psychology
and witty quotes. How many later writers have in their turn borrowed
from-plagiarized-S- hakespeare?
We all know how few of today's politicians write their own speeches.
Their own words would not win them a single vote; their eloquence and
wit, whatever there is of it, they owe to a speech writer. Other people
do the work, they take the credit. The upside of this is that it is a kind
of power that is available to everyone. Leam to use the knowledge of the
past and you will look like a genius, even when you are really just adever

REVERSAL
There are times when taking the credit for work that others have done is
not the wise course: If your power is not firmly enough established, you
will seem to be pushing people out of the limelight. To be a brilliant ex­
ploiter of talent your position must be unshakable, or you will be accused
of deception.
Be sure you know when letting other people share the credit serves
your purpose. It is especially important to not be greedy when you have a
master above you. President Richard Nixon's historie visit to the People's
RepubHc of China was originally his idea, but it might never have come off
but for the deft diplomacy of Henry Kissinger. Nor would it have been as
successful without Kissinger's skills. Still, when the time came to take
credit, Kissinger adroitly let Nixon take the Hon's share. Knowing that the
truth would come out later, he was careful not to jeopardize his standing in
the short term by hogging the limelight. Kissinger played the game ex­
pertly: He took credit for the work of those below hirn while graciously
giving credit for his own labors to those above. That is the way to play
the game.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
At the Congress ofVienna in 1814, the major powers ofEurope gathered to
carve up the remains of Napoleon's fallen Empire. The city was fuH of gai­
ety and the balls were the most splendid in memory. Hovering over the
proceedings, however, was the shadow of Napoleon hirnself. Instead of
being executed or exiled far away, he had been sent to the island of Elba,
not far from the co ast of Italy.
Even imprisoned on an island, a man as bold and creative as
Napoleon Bonaparte made everyone nervous. The Austrians plotted to kill
hirn on Elba, but decided it was too risky. Alexander I, Russia's tempera­
mental czar, heightened the anxiety by throwing a fit during the congress
when apart of Poland was denied him: "Beware, I shall loose the mon­
ster!" he threatened. Everyone knew he meant Napoleon. Of all the states­
men gathered in Vienna, only Talleyrand, Napoleon's former foreign
minister, seemed calm and unconcerned. It was as if he knew something
the others did not.
Meanwhile, on the island of Elba, Napoleon's life was a mockery of his
previous glory. As Elba's "king," he had been allowed to form a court­
there was a cook, a wardrobe mistress, an official pianist, and a handful of
courtiers. All this was designed to humiliate Napoleon, and it seemed to
work.
That winter, however, there occurred aseries of events so strange and
dramatic they might have been scripted in a play. Elba was surrounded by
British ships, their cannons covering all possible exit points. Yet somehow,
in broad daylight on 26 February 1815, a ship with nine hundred men on
board picked up Napoleon and put to sea. The English gave chase but the
ship got away. This almost impossible escape astonished the public
throughout Europe, and terrified the statesmen at the Congress of Vienna.
Although it would have been safer to leave Europe, Napoleon not only
chose to return to France, he raised the odds by marching on Paris with a
tiny army, in hopes of recapturing the throne. His strategy worked-people
of all classes threw themselves at his feet. An army under Marshal Ney sped
from Paris to arrest hirn, but when the soldiers saw their beloved former
leader, they changed sides. Napoleon was declared emperor again. Volun­
teers swelled the ranks of his new army. Delirium swept the country. In Paris,
crowds went wild. The king who had replaced Napoleon fled the country.
For the next hundred days, Napoleon ruled France. Soon, however, the
giddiness subsided. France was bankrupt, its resources nearly exhausted,
and there was little Napoleon could do about this. At the Battle ofWaterloo,
in June of that year, he was finally defeated for good. This time his enemies
had learned their lesson: They exiled hirn to the barren island of Saint He­
lena, off the west coast of Mrica. There he had no more hope of escape.
Interpretation
Only years later did the facts of Napoleon's dramatic escape from Elba
come to light. Before he decided to attempt this bold move, visitors to his
court had told hirn that he was more popular in France than ever, and that
LAW 8 63

[PAGE 88]
the country would embrace hirn again. One of these visitors was Austria's
General Koller, who convinced Napoleon that if he escaped, the European
powers, England included, would welcome him back into power. Napoleon
was tipped off that the English would let hirn go, and indeed his escape oc­
curred in the middle of the afternoon, in full view of English spyglasses.
What Napoleon did not know was that there was a man behind it all,
pulling the strings, and that this man was his former minister, Talleyrand.
And Talleyrand was doing all this not to bring back the glory days but to
crush Napoleon once and for all. Considering the emperor's ambition un­
settling to Europe's stability, he had turned against hirn long ago. When
Napoleon was exiled to Elba, Talleyrand had protested. Napoleon should
be sent farther away, he argued, or Europe would never have peace. But
no one listened.
Instead of pushing his opinion, Talleyrand bided his time. Working
quietly, he eventually won over Castlereagh and Mettemich, the foreign
ministers of England and Austria.
Together these men baited Napoleon into escaping. Even Koller's visit,
to whisper the promise of glory in the exile's ear, was part of the plan. Like
a master cardplayer, Talleyrand figured everything out in advance. He
knew Napoleon would fall into the trap he had set. He also foresaw that
Napoleon would lead the country into a war, which, given France's weak­
ened condition, could only last a few months. One diplomat in Vienna,
who understood that Talleyrand was behind it all, said, "He has set the
house ablaze in order to save it from the plague."

KEYS TO POWER
How many times has this scenario played itself out in history: An aggres­
sive leader initiates a series of bold moves that begin by bringing hirn
much power. Slowly, however, his power reaches a peak, and soon every­
thing turns against hirn. His numerous enemies band together; trying to
maintain his power, he exhausts hirnself going in this direction and that,
and inevitably he collapses. The reason for this pattern is that the aggres­
sive person is rarely in full control. He cannot see more than a couple of
moves ahead, cannot see the consequences of this bold move or that one.
Because he is constantly being forced to react to the moves of his ever­
growing host of enemies, and to the unforeseen consequences of his own
rash actions, his aggressive energy is turned against hirn.
In the realm of power, you must ask yourself, what is the point of chas­
ing here and there, trying to solve problems and defeat my enemies, if I
never feel in contro!? Why am I always having to react to events instead of
directing them? The answer is simple: Your idea of power is wrong. You
64 LAW 8

[PAGE 89]
have mistaken aggressive action for effective action. And most often the
most effective action is to stay back, keep calm, and let others be frustrated
by the traps you lay for them, playing for long-term power rather than
quick victory.
Remember: The essence of power is the ability to keep the initiative,
to get others to react to your moves, to keep YOUf opponent and those
around you on the defensive. When you make other people come to you,
you suddenly become the one controlling the situation. And the one who
has control has power. Two things must happen to place you in this posi­
tion: You yourself must learn to master YOUf emotions, and never to be in­
fluenced by anger; meanwhile, however, you must play on people's natural
tendency to react angrily when pushed and baited. In the long run, the
ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any
tool of aggression.
Study how Talleyrand, the master of the art, performed this delicate
trick. First, he overcame the urge to try to convince his fellow statesmen
that they needed to banish Napoleon far away. It is only natural to want to
persuade people by pleading YOUf case, imposing YOUf will with words. But
this often turns against you. Few of Talleyrand's contemporaries believed
Napoleon was still a threat, so that if he had spent a lot of energy trying to
convince them, he would only have made himself look foolish. Instead, he
held his tongue and his emotions in check. Most important of all, he laid
Napoleon a sweet and irresistible trap. He knew the man's weakness, his
impetuosity, his need for glory and the love of the masses, and he played
all this to perfection. When Napoleon went for the bait, there was no dan­
ger that he might succeed and turn the tables on Talleyrand, who better
than anyone knew France's depleted state. And even had Napoleon been
able to overcome these difficulties, the likelihood of bis success would have
been greater were he able to choose his time and place of action. By setting
the proper trap, Talleyrand took the time and place into his own hands.
All of us have only so much energy, and there is a moment when OUf
energies are at their peak. When you make the other person come to you,
he wears himself out, wasting his energy on the trip. In the year 1905, Rus­
sia and Japan were at war. The J apanese had only recently begun to mod­
emize their warships, so that the Russians had a stronger navy, but by
spreading false information the Japanese marshal Togo Heihachiro baited
the Russians into leaving their docks in the Baltic Sea, making them believe
they could wipe out the J apanese fleet in one swift attack. The Russian fleet
could not reach Japan by the quickest route-through the Strait of Gibral­
tar and then the Suez Canal into the Indian Ocean-because these were
controlled by the British, and Japan was an ally of Great Britain. They had
to go around the Cape of Good Hope, at the southern tip of Africa, adding
over more than six thousand miles to the voyage. Once the fleet passed the
Cape, the Japanese spread another false story: They were sailing to launch
a counterattack. So the Russians made the entire journey to Japan on com­
bat alert. By the time they arrived, their seamen were tense, exhausted, and
overworked, while the Japanese had been waiting at their ease. Despite the
LAW 8 65

[PAGE 90]
odds and their lack of experience in modem naval warfare, the Japanese
crushed the Russians.
One added benefit of making the opponent come to you, as the Japa­
nese discovered with the Russians, is that it forces hirn to operate in your
territory. Being on hostile ground will make hirn nervous and often he will
rush his actions and make mistakes. For negotiations or meetings, it is al­
ways wise to lure others into your territory, or the territory of your choice.
You have your bearings, while they see nothing familiar and are subtly
placed on the defensive.
Manipulation is a dangerous game. Once someone suspects he is
being manipulated, it becomes harder and harder to control hirn. But
when you make your opponent come to you, you create the illusion that he
is controlling the situation. He does not feel the strings that pull hirn, just as
Napoleon imagined that he hirnself was the master of his daring escape and
return to power.
Everything depends on the sweetness of your bait. If your trap is at­
tractive enough, the turbulence of your enemies' emotions and desires will
blind them to reality. The greedier they become, the more they can be led
around.
The great nineteenth-century robber baron Daniel Drew was a master
at playing the stock market. When he wanted a particular stock to be
bought or sold, driving prices up or down, he rarely resorted to the direct
approach. One of his tricks was to hurry through an exclusive club near
Wall Street, obviously on his way to the stock exchange, and to pull out his
customary red bandanna to wipe his perspiring brow. A slip of paper
would fall from this bandanna that he would pretend not to notice. The
club's members were always trying to foresee Drew's moves, and they
would pounce on the paper, which invariably seemed to contain an inside
tip on a stock. Word would spread, and members would buy or seIl the
stock in droves, playing perfectly into Drew's hands.
If you can get other people to dig their own graves, why sweat your­
self? Pickpockets work this to perfection. The key to picking a pocket is
knowing which pocket contains the wallet. Experienced pickpockets often
ply their trade in train stations and other places where there is a clearly
marked sign reading BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS. Passersby seeing the sign in­
variably feel for their wallet to make sure it is still there. For the watching
pickpockets, this is like shooting fish in a barrel. Pickpockets have even
been known to place their own BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS signs to ensure
their success.
When you are making people come to you, it is sometimes better to let
them know you are forcing their hand. You give up deception for overt ma­
nipulation. The psychological ramifications are profound: The person who
makes others come to hirn appears powernd, and demands respect.
Filippo Brunelleschi, the great Renaissance artist and architect, was a
great practitioner of the art of making others come to hirn as a sign of his
power. On one occasion he had been engaged to repair the dome of the
Santa Maria deI Fiore cathedral in Florence. The commission was impor-
66 LAW 8

[PAGE 91]
taut and prestigious. But when the city officials hired a second man,
Lorenzo Ghiberti, to work with Brunelleschi, the great artist brooded in se­
cret. He knew that Ghiberti had gotten the job through his connections,
and that he would do none of the work and get half the credit. At a critical
moment of the construction, then, Brunelleschi suddenly developed a mys­
terious illness. He had to stop work, but pointed out to city officials that
they had hired Ghiberti, who should have been able to continue the work
on his OWll. Soon it became dear that Ghiberti was useless and the officials
came begging to Brunelleschi. He ignored them, insisting that Ghiberti
should finish the project, until finally they realized the problem: They fired
Ghiberti.
By some mirade, Brunelleschi recovered within days. He did not have
to throw a tautrum or make a fool of hirnself; he simply practiced the art of
"making others come to you."
If on one occasion you make it a point of dignity that others must
come to you and you succeed, they will continue to do so even after you
stop trying.

that knows it is hunted is nearly

Authority: Good warriors make others

is the principle of emptiness and fullness
of others and self. When you induce oppo­
nents to come to you, then their force is

ing emptiness with fullness is like throwing

century commentator on The Art of War)
LAW 8 67

[PAGE 92]
REVERSAL
Although it is generally the wiser policy to make others exhaust themselves
chasing you, there are opposite cases where striking suddenly and aggres­
sively at the enemy SO demoralizes hirn that his energies sink. Instead of
making others come to you, you go to them, force the issue, take the lead.
Fast attack can be an awesome weapon, for it forces the other person to
react without the time to think or plan. With no time to think, people make
errors of judgment, and are thrown on the defensive. This tactic is the ob­
verse of waiting and baiting, but it serves the same function: You make
your enemy respond on your terms.
Men like Cesare Borgia and Napoleon used the element of speed to in­
timidate and control. A rapid and unforeseen move is terrifying and de­
moralizing. You must choose YOUf tactics depending on the situation. If
you have time on YOUf side, and know that you and your enemies are at
least at equal strength, then deplete their strength by making them come to
you. If time is against YOU-yOUf enemies are weaker, and waiting will only
give them the chance to recover-give them no such chance. Strike quickly
and they have nowhere to go. As the boxer Joe Louis put it, "He can run,
but he can't hide."

Verbal argument has one vital use in the realm of power: To distract and
cover your tracks when you are practicing deception or are caught in a He.
In such cases it is to your advantage to argue with all the conviction you
can muster. Draw the other person into an argument to distract them from
your deceptive move. When caught in a He, the more emotional and cer­
tain you appear, the less Hkely it seems that you are lying.
This technique has saved the hide of many a con artist. Once Count
Victor Lustig, swindler par excellence, had sold dozens of suckers around
the country a phony box with which he claimed to be able to copy money.
Discovering their mistake, the suckers generally chose not to go the police,
rather than risk the embarrassment of publicity. But one Sheriff Richards,
74 LAW 9

[PAGE 99]
of Remsen County, Oklahoma, was not the kind of man to accept being
conned out of $10,000, and one moming he tracked Lustig down to a hotel
in Chicago.
Lustig heard a knock on the door. When he opened it he was looking
down the barrel of a gun . "What seems to be the problem?" he calmly
asked. "You son of a bitch," yelled the sheriff, "1'm going to kill you. You
conned me with that damn box of yours!" Lustig feigned confusion. "You
mean it's not working?" he asked. "You know it's not working," replied the
sheriff. "But that's impossible," said Lustig. "There's no way it couldn't be
working. Did you operate it properly?" "I did exactly what you told me to
do," said the sheriff. "No, you must have done something wrong," said
Lustig. The argument went in circles. The barrel ofthe gun was gently low­
ered.
Lustig next went to phase two in the argument tactic: He poured out a
whole bunch of technical gobbledygook about the box's operation, com­
pletely beguiling the sheriff, who now appeared less sure of himself and ar­
gued less forcefully. "Look," said Lustig, "1'11 give you your money back
right now. 1'11 also give you written instructions on how to work the ma­
chine and 1'11 come out to Oklahoma to make sure it's working properly.
There's no way you can lose on that." The sheriff reluctantly agreed. To
satisfy him tota1ly, Lustig took out a hundred one-hundred-dollar bills and
gave them to him, telling him to relax and have a fun weekend in Chicago.
Calmer and a little confused, the sheriff finally left. Over the next few days
Lustig checked the paper every moming. He finally found what he was
looking for: A short article reporting Sheriff Richards's arrest, trial, and
conviction for passing counterfeit notes. Lustig had won the argument; the
sheriff never bothered hirn again.

KEYS TO POWER
Those misfortunates among us who have been brought down by circum­
stances beyond their control deserve all the help and sympathy we can
give them. But there are others who are not born to misfortune or unhappi­
ness, but who draw it upon themselves by their destructive actions and un­
settling effect on others. It would be a great thing if we could raise them up,
change their patterns, but more often than not it is their patterns that end
up getting inside and changing uso The reason is simple--humans are ex­
tremely susceptible to the moods, emotions, and even the ways of thinking
of those with whom they spend their time.
The incurably unhappy and unstable have a particularly strong infect-

ing power because their characters and emotions are so intense. They often
present themselves as victims, making it difficult, at first, to see their mis­
eries as self-inflicted. Before you realize the real nature of their problems
you have been infected by them.
Understand this: In the game of power, the people you associate with
are critical. The risk of associating with infectors is that you will waste valu­
able time and energy trying to free yourself. Through a kind of guilt by as­
sociation, you will also suffer in the eyes of others. Never underestimate the
dangers of infection.
There are many kinds of infector to be aware of, but one of the most
insidious is the sufferer from chronic dissatisfaction. Cassius, the Roman
conspirator againstJulius Caesar, had the discontent that comes from deep
envy. He simply could not endure the presence of anyone of greater talent.
Probably because Caesar sensed the man's interminable soumess, he
passed hirn up for the position of first praetorship, and gave the position to
Brutus instead. Cassius brooded and broorl.ed, his hatred for Caesar be­
coming pathological. Brutus himself, a devoted republican, disliked Cae­
sar's dictatorship; had he had the patience to wait, he would have become
the first man in Rome after Caesar's death, and could have undone the evil
that the leader had wrought. But Cassius infected hirn with his own rancor,
bending his ear daily with tales of Caesar's evil. He finally won Brutus over
to the conspiracy. It was the beginning of a great tragedy. How many mis­
fortunes could have been avoided had Brutus learned to fear the power of
infection.
There is only one solution to infection: quarantine. But by the time
you recognize the problem it is often too late. A Lola Montez overwhelms
you with her forceful personality. Cassius intrigues you with his confiding
nature and the depth of his feelings. How can you protect yourself against
such insidious viruses? The answer lies in judging people on the effects
they have on the world and not on the reasons they give for their prob-

take pity. Do not enmesh yourself in trying to help. The infector will re­

The other side of infection is equally valid, and perhaps more readily
understood: There are people who attract happiness to themselves by their
good cheer, natural buoyancy, and intelligence. They are a source of plea­

upon themselves.
80 LAW 10

[PAGE 105]
This applies to more than good cheer and success: All positive quali­
ties can infect uso Talleyrand had many strange and intimidating traits, but
most agreed that he surpassed all Frenchmen in graciousness, aristocratic
charm, and wit. Indeed he came from one of the oldest noble families in
the country, and despite his belief in democracy and the French Republic,
he retained his courtly manners. His contemporary Napoleon was in many
ways the opposite-a- peasant from Corsica, tacitum and ungracious, even
violent.
There was no one Napoleon admired more than Talleyrand. He en­
vied his minister's way with people, his wit and his ability to c.l,arm
women, and as best he could, he kept Talleyrand around him, hoping to
soak up the culture he lacked. There is no doubt that Napoleon changed as
his rule cvntinued. Many of the rough edges were smoothed by his con­
staut association with Talleyrand.
Use the positive side of this emotional osmosis to advantage. If, for ex­
ample, you are miserly by nature, you will never go beyond a certain limit;
only generous souls attain greatness. Associate with the generous, then,
and they will infect you, opening up everything that is tight and restricted
in you. If you are gloomy, gravitate to the cheerful. If you are prone to iso­
lation, force yourself to befriend the gregarious. Never associate with those
who share your defects-they will reinforce everything that holds you
back. Only create associations with positive affinities. Make this a rule of
life and you will benefit more than from all the therapy in the world.
Authority: Recognize the fortu­
nate so that you may choose
their company, and the unfortu­
nate so that you may avoid
them. Misfortune is usually the
crime of folly, and among those
who suffer from it there is no
malady more contagious: Never
open your door to the least of
misfortunes, for, if you do, many
others will follow in its train . . . .
Do not die of another's misery.
(Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658)
REVERSAL
This law admits of no reversal. Its application is universal. There is nothing
to be gained by associating with those who infect you with their misery;
there is only power and good fortune to be obtained by associating with
the fortunate. Ignore this law at your peril.

so many other condottieri as able and valiant as they were. They were re­
placeable. Nothing was lost by killing them. Meanwhile, the older among
them had grown powerful themselves, and wanted more and more money
for their services. How much better, then, to do away with them and hire a
younger, cheaper mercenary. That was the fate of the Count of Carma­
gnola, who had started to act impudently and independently. He had taken
his power for granted without making sure that he was truly indispensable.
Such is the fate (to a less violent degree, one hopes) of those who do
not make others dependent on them. Sooner or later someone comes along
who can do the job as weIl as they can-someone younger, fresher, less ex­
pensive, less threatening.
Be the only one who can do what you do, and make the fate of those who
hire you so entwined with yours that they cannot possibly get rid of you.
Otherwise you will someday be forced to cross your own Bridge of Sighs.

ROBERT DODSLFY,
When the prophecy came true, Louis was terrified, thinking that either the 1703-1764
man had murdered the woman to prove his accuracy or that he was so
versed in his science that his powers threatened Louis hirnself. In either
case he had to be killed.
One evening Louis summoned the astrologer to his room, high in the
castle. Before the man arrived, the king told his servants that when he gave
LAW 11 85

[PAGE 110]
the signal they were to pick the astrologer up, carry him to the window,
and hurl him to the ground, hundreds of feet below.
The astrologer so on arrived, but before giving the signal, Louis de-­
cided to ask him one last question: "You claim to understand astrology and
to know the fate of others, so tell me what your fate will be and how long
you have to live."
"I shall die just three days before Your Majesty," the astrologer replied.
The king's signal was never given. The man's life was spared. The Spider
King not only protected bis astrologer for as long as he was alive, he lav­
ished him with gifts and had him tended by the finest court doctors.
The astrologer survived Louis by several years, disproving his power
of prophecy but proving his mastery of power.
This is the model: Make others dependent on you. To get rid of you
might spell disaster, even death, and your master dares not tempt fate by
finding out. There are many ways to obtain such a position. Foremost
among them is to possess a talent and creative skill that simply cannot be
replaced.
During the Renaissance, the major obstacle to a painter's success was
finding the right patron. Michelangelo did this better than anyone else: His
patron was Pope Julius H. But he and the pope quarreled over the building
of the pope's marble tomb, and Michelangelo left Rome in disgust. To the
amazement of those in the pope's circle, not only did the pope not fire him,
he sought him out and in his own haughty way begged the artist to stay.
Michelangelo, he knew, could find another patron, but he could never find
another Michelangelo.
You do not have to have the talent of a Michelangelo; you do have to
have a skill that sets you apart from the crowd. You should create a situa­
tion in which you can always latch on to another master or patron but your
master cannot easily find another servant with your particular talent. And
if, in reality, you are not actually indispensable, you must find a way to
make it look as if you are. Having the appearance of specialized knowledge
and skill gives you leeway in your ability to deceive those above you into
thinking they cannot do without you. Real dependence on your master's
part, however, leaves him more vulnerable to you than the faked variety,
and it is always within your power to make your skill indispensable.
This is what is meant by the intertwining of fates: Like creeping ivy,
you have wrapped yourself around the source of power, so that it would
cause great trauma to cut you away. And you do not necessarily have to en­
twine yourself around the master; another person will do, as long as he or
she too is indispensable in the chain.
One day Harry Cohn, president of Columbia Pictures, was visited in
his office by a gloomy group of his executives. It was 1951, when the witch­
hunt against Communists in Hollywood, carried on by the U.S. Congress's
House Un-American Activities Committee, was at its height. The execu­
tives had bad news: One of their employees, the screenwriter John Howard
Lawson, had been singled out as a Communist. They had to get rid of him
right away or suffer the wrath of the committee.
86 LAW 11

[PAGE 111]
Harry Cohn was no bleeding-heart liberal; in fact, he had always been
a die-hard Republican.
His favorite politician was Benito Mussolini, whom he had once vis­
ited, and whose framed photo hung on his wall. If there was someone he
hated Cohn would call him a "Communist bastard." But to the executives'
amazement Cohn told them he would not fire Lawson. He did not keep the
screenwriter on because he was a good writer-there were many good
writers in Hollywood. He kept hirn because of a chain of dependence:
Lawson was Humphrey Bogart's writer and Bogart was Columbia's star. If
Cohn messed with Lawson he would ruin an immensely profitable rela­
tionship. That was worth more than the terrible publicity brought to hirn
by his defiance of the committee.
Henry Kissinger managed to survive the many bloodlettings that went
on in the Nixon White House not because he was the best diplomat Nixon
could find-there were other fine negotiators-and not because the two
men got along so well: They did not. Nor did they share their beliefs and
politics. Kissinger survived because he entrenched hirnself in so many
areas of the political structure that to do away with hirn would lead to

ity as an artist; Kissinger's was He got hirnself involved in so
many aspects and departments of the administration that his involvement
became a card in his hand. It also made hirn many allies. If you can
arrange such a position for yourself, getting rid of you becomes
dangerous-all sorts of interdependencies will unravel. Still, the intensive
form of power provides more freedom than the extensive, because those
who have it depend on no particular master, or particular position of
power, for their security.
To make others dependent on you, one route to take is the secret­
intelligence tactic. By knowing other people's secrets, by holding informa­
tion that they wouldn't want broadcast, you seal your fate with theirs. You
are untouchable. Ministers of secret police have held this position through­
out the ages: They can make or break a king, or, as in the case of J. Edgar
Hoover, a president. But the role is so full of insecurities and paranoia that
the power it provides almost cancels itself out. You cannot rest at ease, and
what good is power if it brings you no peace?
One last waming: Do not imagine that your master's dependence on
you will make him love you. In fact, he may resent and fear you. But, as
Machiavelli said, it is better to be feared than loved. Fear you can control;
love, never. Depending on an emotion as subtle and changeable as love or
friendship will only make you insecure. Better to have others depend on
you out of fear of the consequences of losing you than out of love of your
company.

REVERSAL
The weakness of making others depend on you is that you are in some
measure dependent on them. But trying to move beyond that point means
getting rid of those above you-it means standing alone, depending on no
one. Such is the monopolistic drive of aJ. P. Morgan or aJohn D. Rocke­
feller-to drive out all competition, to be in complete control. If you can
corner the market, so much the better.
No such independence comes without a price. You are forced to isolate
yourself. Monopolies often turn inward and destroy themselves from the in­
ternal pressure. They also stir up powernd resentment, making their ene­
mies bond together to fight them. The drive for complete control is often
ruinous and fruitless. Interdependence remains the law, independence a
rare and often fatal exception. Better to place yourself in a position of mu­
tual dependence, then, and to follow this criticallaw rather than look for its
reversal. You will not have the unbearable pressure ofbeing on top, and the
master above you will in essence be your slave, for he will depend on you.

step further. No normal con man would have dared such a con; he would
have chosen his suckers for their meekness, for that look about them that
says they will take their medicine without complaint. Con Capone and you
would spend the rest of your life (whatever remained of it) afraid. But
Lustig understood that a man like Capone spends his life rrlistrusting oth­
ers. No one around hirn is honest or generous, and being so much in the
company of wolves is exhausting, even depressing. A man like Capone
yearns to be the recipient of an honest or generous gesture, to feel that not
everyone has an angle or is out to rob hirn.
Lustig's act of selective honesty disarmed Capone because it was so
unexpected. A con artist loves conflicting emotions like these, since the
person caught up in them is so easily distracted and deceived.
Do not shy away from practicing this law on the Capones of the world.
With a well-timed gesture of honesty or generosity, you will have the most

KEYS TO POWER
The essence of deception is distraction. Distracting the people you want to
deceive gives you the time and space to do something they won't notice,
An act of kindness, generosity, or honesty is often the most powerful form
of distraction because it disarms other people's suspicions, It turns them
into children, eagerly lapping up any kind of affectionate gesture.
In ancient China this was called "giving before you take"-the giving
makes it hard for the other person to notice the taking. It is a device with
infinite practical uses. Brazenly taking something from someone is danger­
ous, even for the powerful. The victim will plot revenge, It is also danger­
ous simply to ask for what you need, no matter how politely: Unless the
other person sees some gain for themselves, they may come to resent your
neediness. Learn to give before you take. It softens the ground, takes the
bite out of a future request, or simply creates a distraction. And the giving
can take many forms: an actual gift, a generous act, a kind favor, an "hon­
est" admission-whatever it takes,
Selective honesty is best employed on your first encounter with some­
one. We are all creatures of habit, and our first impressions last a long time.
If someone believes you are honest at the start of your relationship it takes
a lot to convince them otherwise. This gives you room to maneuver.
Jay Gould, like Al Capone, was a man who distrusted everyone.
By the time he was thirty-three he was already a multimillionaire,
mostly through deception and strong-arming. In the late 1860s, Gould in­
vested heavily in the Erle Railroad, then discovered that the market had
LAW 12 91

[PAGE 116]
been flooded with a vast amount of phony stock certificates for the com­
pany. He stood to lose a fortune and to suffe r a lot of embarrassment.
In the midst ofthis crlsis, a man named LordJohn Gordon-Gordon of­
fered to help. Gordon-Gordon, a Scottish lord, had apparendy made a
small fortune investing in railroads.
By hirlng some handwriting experts· Gordon-Gordon was able to
prove to Gould that the culprlts for the phony stock certificates were actu­
ally several top executives with the Erle Railroad itself. Gould was grateful.
Gordon-Gordon then proposed that he and Gould join forces to buy up a
controlling interest in Erle. Gould agreed. For a while the venture ap­
peared to prosper. The two men were now good friends, and every time
Gordon-Gordon came to Gould asking for money to buy more stock,
Gould gave it to him. In 1873, however, Gordon-Gordon suddenly
dumped all of his stock, making a fortune but drastically lowering the value
of Gould's own holdings. Then he disappeared from sight.
Upon investigation, Gould found out that Gordon-Gordon's real name
was John Crowningsfield, and that he was the bastard son of a merchant
seaman and a London barmaid. There had been many clues before then
that Gordon-Gordon was a con man, but his initial act of honesty and sup­
port had so blinded Gould that it took the loss of millions for hirn to see
through the scheme.
A single act of honesty is often not enough. What is required is a repu­
tation for honesty, built on a serles of acts-b- ut these can be quite inconse­
quential. Once this reputation is established, as with first impressions, it is
hard to shake.
In ancient China, Duke Wu of CMng decided it was time to take over
the increasingly powerful kingdom of Hu. Telling no one of his plan, he
married his daughter to Hu' s roler. He then called a council and asked his
ministers, "I am considering a military campaign. Which country should
we invade?" As he had expected, one of his ministers replied, "Hu should
be invaded." The duke seemed angry, and said, "Hu is a sister state now.
Why do you suggest invading her?" He had the minister executed for his
impolitic remark. The ruler of Hu heard about this, and considerlng other
tokens ofWu's honesty and the marriage with his daughter, he took no pre­
cautions to defend hirnself from Cheng. A few weeks later, Cheng forces
swept through Hu and took the country, never to relinquish it.
Honesty is one of the best ways to disarm the wary, but it is not the
only one. Any kind of noble, apparendy selfless act will serve. Perhaps the
best such act, though, is one of generosity. Few people can resist a gUt, even
from the most hardened enemy, which is why it is often the perfect way to
disarm people. A gift brings out the child in us, instandy lowerlng our de­
fenses. Although we often view other people's actions in the most cynical
light, we rarely see the Machiavellian element of a gift, which quite often
hides ulterlor motives. A gift is the perfect object in which to hide a decep­
tive move.
Over three thousand years ago the ancient Greeks traveled across the
sea to recapture the beautiful Helen, stolen away from them by Paris, and
92 LAW 12

[PAGE 117]
to destroy Paris's city, Troy. The siege lasted ten years, many heroes died,
yet neither side had come elose to victory. One day, the prophet Calchas
assembled the Greeks.
"Stop battering away at these walls!" he told them. "You must find
some other way, some ruse. We cannot take
Troy by force alone. We I mage : T h e must find some cunning

Odysseus then came up Y0 u r g u i le i s with the idea of building
a giant wooden horse, hidden inside hiding soldiers inside it,
then offering it to the a magnificent Trojans as a gift.
Neoptolemus, son of gift that proves Achilles, was disgusted
with this idea; it was irresistible to unmanly. Better for
thousands to die on the YOUf opponent. battlefield than to gain
victory so deceitfully. The walls open. But the soldiers, faced
with a choice between Once inside, another ten years of
manliness, honor, and wreak havoc. death, on the one hand
and a quick victory on the other, chose the
horse, which was promptly built. The trick was successful and Troy fell.
One gift did more for the Greek cause than ten years of fighting.
Selective kindness should also be part of your arsenal of deception. For
years the ancient Romans had besieged the city of the Faliscans, always un­
successfully. One day, however, when the Roman general Camillus was
encamped outside the city, he suddenly saw a man leading some children
toward hirn. The man was a Faliscan teacher, and the children, it turned
out, were the sons and daughters of the noblest and wealthiest citizens of
the town. On the pretense of taking these children out for a walk, he had
led them straight to the Romans, offering them as hostages in hopes of in­
gratiating hirnself with Camillus, the city's enemy.
Camillus did not take the children hostage. He stripped the teacher,
tied his hands behind his back, gave each child a rod, and let them whip
him all the way back to the city. The gesture had an immediate effect on
the Faliscans. Had Camillus used the children as hostages, some in the city
would have voted to surrender. And even if the Faliscans had gone on
fighting, their resistance would have been halfhearted. Camillus's refusal to
take advantage of the situation broke down the Faliscans' resistance, and
they surrendered. The general had calculated correctly. And in any case he
had had nothing to lose: He knew that the ho stage ploy would not have
ended the war, at least not right away. By tuming the situation around, he
earned his enemy's trust and respect, disarming them. Selective kindness
will often break down even the most stubborn foe: Aiming right for the
heart, it corrodes the will to fight back.
Remember: By playing on people's emotions, calculated acts of kind­
ness can turn a Capone into a gullible child. As with any emotional ap­
proach, the tactic must be practiced with caution: If people see through it,
their disappointed feelings of gratitude and warmth will become the most
violent hatred and distrust. Unless you can make the gesture seem sincere
and heartfelt, do not play with fire.

REVERSAL
When you have a history of deceit behind you, no amount of honesty, gen­
erosity, or kindness will fool people. In fact it will only call attention to it­
self. Once people have come to see you as deceitful, to act honest all of a
sudden is simply suspicious. In these cases it is better to play the rogue.
Count Lustig, pulling the biggest con of his career, was about to sell
the Eiffel Tower to an unsuspecting industrialist who believed the govern­
ment was auctioning it off for scrap metal. The industrialist was prepared
to hand over a huge sum of money to Lustig, who had successfully imper­
sonated a government official. At the last minute, however, the mark was
suspicious. Something about Lustig bothered hirn. At the meeting in which
he was to hand over the money, Lustig sensed his sudden distrust.
Leaning over to the industrialist, Lustig explained, in a low whisper,
how low his salary was, how difficult his finances were, on and on. After a
few minutes of this, the industrialist realized that Lustig was asking for a
bribe. For the first time he relaxed. Now he knew he could trust Lustig:
Since all government officials were dishonest, Lustig had to be real. The
man forked over the money. By acting dishonest, Lustig seemed the real
McCoy. In this case selective honesty would have had the opposite effect.
As the French diplomat Talleyrand grew older, his reputation as a mas­
ter liar and deceiver spread. At the Congress of Vienna (1814-1815), he
would spin fabulous stories and make impossible remarks to people who
knew he had to be lying. His dishonesty had no purpose except to cloak
the moments when he really was deceiving them. One day, for example,
among friends, Talleyrand said with apparent sincerity, "In business one
ought to show one's hand." No one who heard him could believe their
ears: A man who never once in his life had shown his cards was telling
other people to show theirs. Tactics like this made it impossible to distin­
guish Talleyrand's real deceptions from his fake ones. By embracing his
reputation for dishonesty, he preserved his ability to deceive.
Nothing in the realm of power is set in stone. Overt deceptiveness will
sometimes cover YOUf tracks, even making you admired for the honesty of
your dishonesty.

Castruccio listened patiently. He seemed not the slightest bit angry or

and he asked him to bring his entire family to the palace to talk over their
grievances and come to an agreement. As they took leave of one another,
Castruccio said he thanked God for the chance he had been given to show
his clemency and kindness. That evening the entire Poggio family came to
the palace. Castruccio immediately had them imprisoned and a few days
later all were executed, including Stefano.

Stefano di Poggio is the embodiment of all those who believe that the jus­
tice and nobility of their cause will prevail. Certainly appeals to justice and
gratitude have occasionally succeeded in the past, but more often than not

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In 433 B.C., just before the Peloponnesian War, the island of Corcyra (later
called Corfu) and the Greek city-state of Corinth stood on the brink of con­
flict. Both parties sent ambassadors to Athens to try to win over the Atheni­
ans to their side. The stakes were high, since whoever had Athens on his
side was sure to win. And whoever won the war would certainly give the
defeated side no mercy.
Corcyra spoke first. Its ambassador began by admitting that the island
had never helped Athens before, and in fact had allied itself with Athens's
enemies. There were no ties of friendship or gratitude between Corcyra
and Athens. Yes, the ambassador admitted, he had come to Athens now
out of fear and concern for Corcyra's safety. The only thing he could offer
was an alliance of mutual interests. Corcyra had a navy only surpassed in
size and strength by Athens's own; an alliance between the two states
would create a formidable force, one that could intimidate the riyal state of
Sparta. That, unfortunately, was all Corcyra had to offer.
The representative from Corinth then gave a brilliant, passionate
speech, in sharp contrast to the dry, colorless approach of the Corcyran.
He talked of everything Corinth had done for Athens in the past. He asked
how it would look to Athens's other allies if the city put an agreement with
a former enemy over one with a present friend, one that had served
Athens's interest loyally: Perhaps those allies would break their agreements
with Athens if they saw that their loyalty was not valued. He referred to
Hellenic law, and the need to repay Corinth for all its good deeds. He fi­
nally went on to list the many services Corinth had performed for Athens,
and the importance of showing gratitude to one's friends.
After the speech, the Athenians debated the issue in an assembly. On
LAW 13 97

[PAGE 122]
the second round, they voted overwhelmingly to ally with Corcyra and
drop Corinth.
Interpretation
History has remembered the Athenians nobly, but they were the preemi­
nent realists of classical Greece. With them, all the rhetoric, all the emo­
tional appeals in the world, could not match a good pragmatic argument,
especially one that added to their power.
What the Corinthian ambassador did not realize was that his refer­
ences to Corinth's past generosity to Athens only irritated the Athenians,
subtly asking them to feel guilty and putting them under obligation. The
Athenians couldn't care less about past favors and friendly feelings. At the
same time, they knew that if their other allies thought them ungrateful for
abandoning Corinth, these city-states would still be unlikely to break their
ties to Athens, the preeminent power in Greece. Athens ruled its empire by
force, and would simply compel any rebellious ally to return to the fold.
When people choose between talk about the past and talk about the
future, a pragmatic person will always opt for the future and forget the past.
As the Corcyrans realized, it is always best to speak pragmatically to a
pragmatic person. And in the end, most people are in fact pragmatic-they
will rarely act against their own self-interest.
It has always been a ruZe that the weak should be subject to the strong;
and besides, we consider that we are worthy of our power. Up tilZ the
present moment you, too, used to think that we were; but now, after
calculating your own interest, you are beginning to talk in terms of right
and wrong. Considerations of this kind have never yet turned people aside
from the opportunities of aggrandizement offered by superior strength.
Athenian representative to Sparta,
quoted in The Peloponnesian War, Thucydides, c. 465-395 B.r;.
KEYS TO POWER
In your quest for power, you will constantly find yourself in the position of
asking for help from those more powerful than you. There is an art to ask­
ing for help, an art that depends on your ability to understand the person
you are dealing with, and to not confuse your needs with theirs.
Most people never succeed at this, because they are completely
trapped in their own wants and desires. They start from the assumption
that the people they are appealing to have a selfless interest in helping
them. They talk as if their needs mattered to these people--who probably
couldn't care less. Sometimes they refer to larger issues: a great cause, or
grand emotions such as love and gratitude. They go for the big picture
when simple, everyday realities would have much more appeal. What they
do not realize is that even the most powerful person is locked inside needs
of his own, and that if you make no appeal to his self-interest, he merely
sees you as desperate or, at best, a waste of time.

[PAGE 123]
In the sixteenth century, Portuguese missionaries tried for years to con­
vert the people of Japan to Catholicism, while at the same time Portugal
had a monopoly on trade between Japan and Europe. Although the mis­
sionaries did have some success, they never got far among the ruling elite;
by the beginning of the seventeenth century, in fact, their proselytizing had
completely antagonized the Japanese emperor Ieyasu. When the Dutch
began to arrive in Japan in great numbers, Ieyasu was much relieved. He
needed Europeans for their know-how in guns and navigation, and here at
last were Europeans who cared nothing for spreading religion-the Dutch
wanted only to trade. Ieyasu swiftly moved to evict the Portuguese. From
then on, he would only deal with the practical-minded Dutch.
Japan and Holland were vastly different cultures, but each shared a
timeless and universal concern: self-interest. Every person you deal with is
like another culture, an alien land with a past that has nothing to do with
yours. Yet you can bypass the differences between you and hirn by appeal­
ing to his self-interest. Do not be subtle: You have valuable knowledge to
share, you will fill his coffers with gold, you will make hirn live longer and
happier. This is a language that all of us speak and understand.
A key step in the process is to unde rstand the other person's psychol­
ogy. Is he vain? Is he concerned about his reputation or his social standing?
Does he have enemies you could help hirn vanquish? Is he simply moti­
vated by money and power?
When the MongoIs invaded China in the twelfth century, they threat­
ened to obliterate a culture that had thrived for over two thousand years.
Their leader, Genghis Khan, saw nothing in China but a country that
lacked pasturing for his horses, and he decided to destroy the place, level­
ing all its cities, for "it would be better to exterminate the Chinese and let
the grass grow." It was not a soldier, a general, or a king who saved the
Chinese from devastation, but a man named Yelu Ch'u-Ts'ai. A foreigner
hirnself, Ch'u-Ts'ai had come to appreciate the superiority of Chinese cul­
ture. He managed to make hirnself a trusted adviser to Genghis Khan, and
persuaded hirn that he would reap riches out of the place if, instead of de­
stroying it, he simply taxed everyone who lived there. Khan saw the wis­
dom in this and did as Ch'u-Ts'ai advised.
When Khan took the city of Kaifeng, after a long siege, and decided to
massacre its inhabitants (as he had in other cities that had resisted hirn),
Ch'u-Ts'ai told hirn that the finest craftsmen and engineers in China had
fled to Kaifeng, and it would be better to put them to use. Kaifeng was
spared. Never before had Genghis Khan shown such mercy, but then it
really wasn't mercy that saved Kaifeng. Ch'u-Ts'ai knew Khan weIl. He was
a barbaric peasant who cared nothing for culture, or indeed for anything
other than warfa re and practical results. Ch'u-Ts'ai chose to appeal to the
only emotion that would work on such a man: greed.
Self-interest is the lever that will move people. Once you make them
see how you can in some way meet their needs or advance their cause,
their resistance to your requests for help will magically fall away. At each
step on the way to acquiring power, you must train yourself to think your

REVERSAL
Some people will see an appeal to their self-interest as ugly and ignoble.
They actually prefer to be able to exercise charity, mercy, and justice,
which are their ways of feeling superior to you: When you beg them for
help, you emphasize their power and position. They are strang enough to
need nothing from you except the chance to feel superior. This is the wine
that intoxicates them. They are dying to fund your project, to introduce
you to powerful people-provided, of course, that all this is done in public,
and for a good cause (usually the more public, the better). Not everyone,
then, can be approached through cynical self-interest. Same people will be
put off by it, because they don't want to seem to be motivated by such
things. They need opportunities to display their good he art.
Da not be shy. Give them that opporttinity. It's not as if you are con­
ning them by asking for help-it is really their pleasure to give, and to be
seen giving. You must distinguish the differences among powerful people
and figure out what makes them tick. When they ooze greed, da not appeal
to their charity. When they want to look charitable and noble, da not ap­

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
Joseph Duveen was undoubtedly the greatest art dealer of his time-from
1904 to 1940 he almost single-handedly monopolized America's million­
aire art-collecting market. But one prize plum eluded hirn: the industrialist
Andrew Mellon. Before he died, Duveen was determined to make Mellon
a dient.
Duveen's friends said this was an impossible dream. Mellon was a stiff,
tacitum man. The stories he had heard about the congenial, talkative Du­
veen rubbed hirn the wrong way-he had made it dear he had no desire to
meet the man. Yet Duveen told his doubting friends, "Not only will Mellon
buy from me but he will buy only from me." For several years he tracked
his prey, leaming the man's habits, tastes, phobias. To do this, he secretly
put several of Mellon's staff on his own payroll, worming valuable informa­
tion out of them. By the time he moved into action, he knew Mellon about
as well as Mellon's wife did.
In 1921 Mellon was visiting London, and staying in a palatial suite on
the third floor of Claridge's Hotel. Duveen booked hirnself into the suite
just below Mellon's, on the second floor. He had arranged for his valet to
befriend Mellon's valet, and on the fateful day he had chosen to make his
move, Mellon's valet told Duveen's valet, who told Duveen, that he had
just helped Mellon on with his overcoat, and that the industrialist was mak­
ing his way down the corridor to ring for the lift.
Duveen's valet hurriedly helped Duveen with his own overcoat. Sec­
onds later, Duveen entered the lift, and 10 and behold, there was Mellon.
"How do you do, Mr. Mellon?" said Duveen, introducing hirnself. "I am on
my way to the National Gallery to look at some pictures." How uncanny­
that was precisely where Mellon was headed. And so Duveen was able to
accompany his prey to the one location that would ensure his success. He
knew Mellon's taste inside and out, and while the two men wandered
through the museum, he dazzled the magnate with his knowledge. Once
again quite uncannily, they seemed to have remarkably similar tastes.
Mellon was pleasantly surprised: This was not the Duveen he had ex­
pected. The man was charming and agreeable, and dearly had exquisite
taste. When they retumed to New York, Mellon visited Duveen's exdusive
gallery and fell in love with the collection. Everything, surprisingly enough,
seemed to be precisely the kind of work he wanted to collect. For the rest
of his life he was Duveen's best and most generous dient.
Interpretation
A man as ambitious and competitive as Joseph Duveen left nothing to
chance. What's the point of winging it, of just hoping you may be able to
charm this or that dient? It's like shooting ducks blindfolded. Arm yourself
with a little knowledge and your aim improves.
Mellon was the most spectacular of Duveen's catches, but he spied on
many a millionaire. By secretly putting members of his clients' household
staffs on his own payroll, he would gain constant access to valuable infor-
102 LAW 14

[PAGE 127]
mation about their masters' comings and goings, changes in taste, and
other such tidbits of information that would put hirn a step ahead. A riyal
of Duveen's who wanted to make Henry Frick a dient noticed that when­
ever he visited this wealthy New Yorker, Duveen was there before hirn, as
if he had a sixth sense. To other dealers Duveen seemed to be everywhere,
and to know everything before they did. His powers discouraged and dis­
heartened them, until many simply gave up going after the wealthy dients
who could make a dealer rich.
Such is the power of artful spying: It makes you seem all-powerful,
clairvoyant. Your knowledge of your mark can also make you seem charm­
ing, so well can you anticipate his desires. No one sees the source of your
power, and what they cannot see they cannot fight.
Rulers see through spies, as cows through smell, Brahmins through
scriptures and the rest 01 the people through their normal eyes.
Kautilya, Indian philosopher, third antury B.C.
KEYS TO POWER
In the realm of power, your goal is a degree of control over future events.
Part of the problem you face, then, is that people won't tell you all their
thoughts, emotions, and plans. Controlling what they say, they often keep
the most critical parts of their character hidden-their weaknesses, ulterior
motives, obsessions. The result is that you cannot predict their moves, and
are constantly in the dark. The trick is to find a way to probe them, to find
out their secrets and hidden intentions, without letting them know what
you are up to.
This is not as difficult as you might think. A friendly front will let you
secretly gather information on friends and enemies alike. Let others con­
sult the horoscope, or read tarot cards: You have more concrete me ans of
seeing into the future.
The most common way of spying is to use other people, as Duveen
did. The method is simple, powerful, but risky: You will certainly gather in­
formation, but you have little control over the people who are doing the
work. Perhaps they will ineptly reveal your spying, or even secretly turn
against you. It is far better to be the spy yourself, to pose as a friend while
secretly gathering information.
The French politician Talleyrand was one of the greatest practitioners
of this art. He had an uncanny ability to worm secrets out of people in po­
lite conversation. A contemporary of his, Baron de Vitrolles, wrote, "Wit
and grace marked his conversation. He possessed the art of concealing his
thoughts or his malice beneath a transparent veil of insinuations, words
that imply something more than they express. Only when necessary did he
inject his own personality." The key here is Talleyrand's ability to suppress
himself in the conversation, to make others talk endlessly about themselves
and inadvertently reveal their intentions and plans.

people begin to suspect you are worming secrets out of them under the
SnlOPFNIIAUER,
171l8-1860 cover of conversation, they will stricdy avoid you. Emphasize friendly
chatter, not valuable information. Your search for gems of information can­
not be too obvious, or your probing questions will reveal more about your­
self and your intentions than about the information you hope to find.
A trick to try in spying comes from La Rochefoucauld, who wrote,
"Sincerity is found in very few men, and is often the cleverest of ruses-­
one is sincere in order to draw out the confidence and secrets of the other."
By pretending to bare your heart to another person, in other words, you
make them more likely to reveal their own secrets. Give them a fals� con­
fession and they will give you areal one. Another trick was identified by
the philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, who suggested vehemendy contra­
dicting people you're in conversation with as a way of irritating them, stir­
ring them up so that they lose some of the control over their words. In their
emotional re action they will reveal all kinds of truths about themselves,
truths you can later use against them.
Another method of indirect spying is to test people, to lay litde traps
that make them reveal things about themselves. Chosroes 11, a notoriously
clever seventh-century king of the Persians, had many ways of seeing
through his subjects without raising suspicion. If he noticed, for instance,
that two of his courtiers had become particularly friendly, he would call
one of them aside and say he had information that the other was a traitor,
and would soon be killed. The king would tell the courtier he trusted him
more than anyone, and that he must keep this information secret. Then he
104 LAW 14

[PAGE 129]
would watch the two men carefully. If he saw that the second courtier had
not changed in his behavior toward the king, he would conclude that the
first courtier had kept the secret, and he would quickly promote the man,
later taking hirn aside to confess, "I meant to kill your friend because of
certain information that had reached me, but, when 1 investigated the mat­
ter, 1 found it was untrue." If, on the other hand, the second courtier started
to avoid the king, acting aloof and tense, Chosroes would know that the se­
cret had been revealed. He would ban the second courtier from his court,
letting hirn know that the whole business had only been a test, but that
even though the man had done nothing wrong, he could no longer trust
hirn. The first courtier, however, had revealed a secret, and hirn Chosroes
would ban from his entire kingdom.
It may seem an odd form of spying that reveals not empirical informa­
tion but a person's character. Often, however, it is the best way of solving
problems before they arise.
By tempting people into certain acts, you leam about their loyalty,
their honesty, and so on. And this kind of knowledge is often the most
valuable of all: Armed with it, you can predict their actions in the future.

from gods, nor by analogy with past events, nor by astrologie calcu­

uation-from spies. (Sun-tzu, The Art 0/ War, fourth century B.C.)

Information is critical to power, but just as you spy on other people, you
must be prepared for them to spy on you. One of the most potent weapons
in the battle for information, then, is giving out false information. As Win­
ston Churchill said, "Truth is so precious that she should always be at­
tended by a bodyguard of lies." You must surround YOUTself with such a
bodyguard, so that YOUT truth cannot be penetrated. By planting the infor­
mation of YOUT choice, you control the game.
In 1944 the Nazis' rocket-bomb attacks on London suddenly escalated.
Over two thousand V-I flying bombs fell on the city, killing more than five
thousand people and wounding many more. Somehow, however, the Ger­
mans consistently missed their targets. Bombs that were intended for
Tower Bridge, or Piccadilly, would fall weIl short of the city, landing in the
less populated suburbs. This was because, in fixing their targets, the Ger­
mans relied on secret agents they had plant ed in England. They did not
know that these agents had been discovered, and that in their place,
English-controlled agents were feeding them subtly deceptive information.
The bombs would hit farther and farther from their targets every time
they fell. By the end of the campaign they were landing on cows in the
country. By feeding people wrong information, then, you gain a potent ad­
vantage. While spying gives you a third eye, disinformation puts out one of
your enemy's eyes. A cyclops, he always misses his target.

CRUSH YOUR
ENEMY TOTALLY
JUDGMENT
All great leaders since Moses have known that a feared
enemy must be crushed completely. (Sometimes they have
learned this the hard way.) If one ember is left alight, no
matter how dimly it smolders, a fire will eventually break
out. More is lost through stopping halfway than through
total annihilation: The enemy will recover, and will seek
revenge. Crush him, not only in body but in spirit.

concubines of a deceased emperor were bound by tradition and law: Her
head shaven, she entered a convent, for what was supposed to be the rest
of her life. For seven years Wu schemed to escape. By communicating in

NAPOLEON BONAPARTE,
while still sleeping with the emperor. The empress did not discourage
176'i-lH21
this-she had yet to provide the emperor with an heir, her position was
vulnerable, and Wu was a valuable ally.
In 654 Wu Chao gave birth to a child. One day the empress came to
visit, and as so on as she had left, Wu smothered the newborn-her own
baby. When the murder was discovered, suspicion immediately fell on the
empress, who had been on the scene moments earlier, and whose jealous
nature was known by all. This was precisely Wu's plan. Shortly thereafter,
the empress was charged with murder and executed. Wu Chao was
crowned empress in her place. Her new husband, addicted to his life of
pleasure, gladly gave up the reins of govemment to Wu Chao, who was
from then on known as Empress Wu.
Although now in a position of great power, Wu hardly feh secure.
There were enemies everywhere; she could not let down her guard for one
moment. Indeed, when she was forty-one, she began to fear that her beau­
tiful young niece was becoming the emperor's favorite. She poisoned the
woman with a day mixed into her food. In 675 her own son, touted as the
110 LAW 15

[PAGE 135]
heir apparent, was poisoned as weIl. The next-eldest son-illegitimate, but
now the crown prince-was exiled a little later on trumped-up charges.
And when the emperor died, in 683, Wu managed to have the son after
that declared unfit for the throne. All this meant that it was her youngest,
most ineffectual son who finallybecame emperor. In this way she contin­
ued to rule.
Over the next five years there were innumerable palace coups. All of
them failed, and all of the conspirators were executed. By 688 there was no
one left to challenge Wu. She proclaimed herself a divine descendant of
Buddha, and in 690 her wishes were finally granted: She was named Holy
and Divine "Emperor" of China.
Wu became emperor because there was literally nobody left from the
previous T'ang dynasty. And so she ruled unchallenged, for over a decade
ofrelative peace. In 705, at the age of eighty, she was forced to abdicate.
Interpretation
All who knew Empress Wu remarked on her energy and intelligence. At
the time, there was no glory available for an ambitious woman beyond a
few years in the imperial harem, then a lifetime walled up in a convent. In
Wu's gradual but remarkable rise to the top, she was never naive. She
knew that any hesitation, any momentary weakness, would speIl her end.
If, every time she got rid of a riyal a new one appeared, the solution was
simple: She had to crush them all or be killed herself. Other emperors be­
fore her had followed the same path to the top, but Wu-who, as a woman,
had next to no chance to gain power-had to be more ruthless still.
Empress Wu's forty-year reign was one of the longest in Chinese his­
tory. Although the story of her bloody rise to power is weIl known, in
China she is considered one ofthe period's most able and effective rulers.
A priest asked the dying Spanish statesman and general Ram6n Maria Narvaez
(1800-1868), "Does your Exceltency forgive alt your enemies?" "[ do not
have to forgive my enemies, " answered Narvaez, "[ have had them alt shot. "
KEYS TO POWER
It is no accident that the two stories illustrating this law come from China:
Chinese history abounds with examples of enemies who were left alive and
retumed to haunt the lenient. "Crush the enemy" is a key strategie tenet of
Sun-tzu, the fourth-century-B.c. author of The Art ofWar. The idea is simple:
Your enemies wish you ill. There is nothing they want more than to elimi­
nate you. If, in your struggles with them, you stop halfway or even three
quarters of the way, out of mercy or hope of reconciliation, you only make
them more determined, more embittered, and they will someday take re­
venge. They may act friendly for the time being, but this is only because
you have defeated them. They have no choice but to bide their time.
The solution: Have no mercy. Crush your enemies as totally as they
LAW 15 111

[PAGE 136]
would crush you. Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for
from your enemies is their disappearance.
Mao Tse-tung, a devoted reader of Sun-tzu and of Chinese history gen­
erally, knew the importance of this law. In 1934 the Communist leader and
some 75,000 poorly equipped soldiers fled into the desolate mountains of
western China to escape Chiang Kai-shek's much larger army, in what has
since been called the Long March.
Chiang was determined to eliminate every last Communist, and by a
few years later Mao had less than 10,000 soldiers left. By 1937, in fact,
when China was invaded by Japan, Chiang calculated that the Commu­
nists were no longer a threat. He chose to give up the ehase and concen­
trate on the Japanese. Ten years later the Communists had recovered
enough to rout Chiang's army. Chiang had forgotten the ancient wisdom of
erushing the enemy; Mao had not. Chiang was pursued until he and his en­
tire army fled to the island of Taiwan. Nothing remains of his regime in
mainland China to this day.
The wisdom behind "crushing the enemy" is as ancient as the Bible:
Its first praetitioner may have been Moses, who learned it from God Him­
self, when He parted the Red Sea for the Jews, then let the water flow back
over the pursuing Egyptians so that "not so much as one of them re­
mained." When Moses returned from Mount Sinai with the Ten Com­
mandments and found his people worshipping the Golden Calf, he had
every last offender slaughtered. And just before he died, he told his follow­
ers, finally about to enter the Promised Land, that when they had defeated
the tribes of Canaan they should "utterly destroy them . . . make no
eovenant with them, and show no merey to them."
The goal of total victory is an axiom of modem warfare, and was codi­
fied as such by Carl von Clausewitz, the premier philosopher of war. Ana­
lyzing the campaigns of Napoleon, von Clausewitz wrote, "We do claim
that direct annihilation of the enemy's forees must always be the dominant
consideration . . . .O nee a major victory is achieved there must be no talk of
rest, of breathing space . . . but only of the pursuit, going for the enemy
again, seizing his eapital, attacking his reserves and anything else that
might give his country aid and eomfort." The reason for this is that after
war come negotiation and the division of territory. If you have only won a
partial victory, you will inevitably lose in negotiation what you have
gained by war.
The solution is simple: Allow your enemies no options. Annihilate
them and their territory is yours to carve. The goal of power is to control
your enemies completely, to make them obey your will. You cannot afford
to go halfway. If they have no options, they will be forced to do your bid­
ding. This law has applieations far beyond the battlefield. Negotiation is the
insidious viper that will eat away at your vietory, so give your enemies
nothing to negotiate, no hope, no room to maneuver. They are crushed
and that is that.
Realize this: In your struggle for power you will stir up rivalries and
112 LAW 15

[PAGE 137]
create enemies. There will be people you cannot win over, who will re­
main your enemies no matter what. But whatever wound you inflicted on
them, deliberately or not, do not take their hatred personally. Just recog­
nize that there is no possibility of peace between you, especially as long as
you stay in power. If you let them stick around, they will seek revenge, as
certainly as night follows day. To wait for them to show their cards is just
silly; as Empress Wu understood, by then it will be too late.
Be realistic: With an enemy like this around, you will never be secure.
Remember the lessons of history, and the wisdom of Moses and Mao:
Never go halfway.
It is not, of course, a question of murder, it is a question of banishment.
Sufficiently weakened and then exiled from your court forever, your ene­
mies are rendered harmless. They have no hope of recovering, insinuating
themselves and hurting you. And if they cannot be banished, at least un­
derstand that they are plotting against you, and pay no heed to whatever
friendliness they feign. Your only weapon in such a situation is your own
wariness. If you cannot banish them immediately, then plot for the best
time to act.
Image: A Viper crushed
beneath your foot but left
alive, will rear up and bite
you with a double dose of
venom. An enemy that is
left around is like a half­
dead viper that you nurse
back to health. Time makes
the venom grow stronger.
Authority: For it must be
noted, that men must either be
caressed or else annihilated;
they will revenge themselves
for small injuries, but cannot
do so for great ones; the injury
therefore that we do to a man
must be such that we need not
fear his vengeance. (Niccolo
Machiavelli, 1469-1527)
LAW 15 113

[PAGE 138]
REVERSAL
This law should very rarely be ignored, but it does sometimes happen that
it is better to let your enemies destroy themselves, if such a thing is possi­
ble, than to make them suffer by YOUf hand. In warfare, for example, a
good general knows that if he attacks an army when it is comered, its sol­
diers will fight much more fiercely. It is sometimes better, then, to leave
them an escape route, a way out. As they retreat, they wear themselves out,
and are ultiinately more demoralized by the retreat than by any defeat he
rnight inflict on the battlefield. When you have someone on the ropes,
then-but only when you are SUfe they have no chance of recovery-you
rnight let them hang themselves. Let them be the agents of their own de­
struction. The result will be the same, and you won't feel half as bad.
Finally, sometimes by crushing an enemy, you embitter them so much
that they spend years and years plotting revenge. The Treaty of Versailles
had such an effect on the Germans. Some would argue that in the long run
it would be better to show some leniency. The problem is, your leniency
involves another risk-it may embolden the enemy, which still harbors a
grudge, but now has some room to operate. It is almost always wiser to
crush YOUf enemy. If they plot revenge years later, do not let YOUf guard
down, but simply crush them again.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
For many centuries the Assyrians ruled upper Asia with an iron fist. In the
eighth century B.C., however, the people of Medea (now northwestem
Iran) revolted against them, and finally broke free. Now the Medes had to
establish a new govemment. Determined to avoid any form of despotism,
they refused to give ultimate power to any one man, or to establish a
monarchy. Without a leader, however, the country soon fell into chaos,
and fractured into small kingdoms, with village fighting against village.
In one such village lived a man named Deioces, who began to make a
name for hirnself for fair dealing and the ability to settle disputes.
He did this so successfully, in fact, that soon any legal conflict in the
area was brought to hirn, and his power increased. Throughout the land,
the law had fallen into disrepute--the judges were corrupt, and no one en­
trusted their cases to the courts any more, resorting to violence instead.
When news spread of Deioces' wisdom, incorruptibility, and unshakable
impartiality, Medean villages far and wide tumed to hirn to settle all man­
ner of cases. Soon he became the sole arbiter of justice in the land.
At the height of his power, Deioces suddenly decided he had had
enough. He would no longer sit in the chair of judgment, would hear no
more suits, settle no more disputes between brother and brother, village
and village. Complaining that he was spending so much time dealing with
other people's problems that he had neglected his own afaif rs, he retired.
The country once again descended into chaos. With the sudden with­
drawal of a powerful arbiter like Deioces, crime increased, and contempt
for the law was never greater. The Medes held a meeting of all the villages
to decide how to get out of their predicament. "We cannot continue to live
in this country under these conditions," said one triballeader. "Let us ap­
point one of our number to rule so that we can live under orderly govem­
ment, rather than losing our hornes altogether in the present chaos."
And so, despite all that the Medes had suffered under the Assyrian des­
potism, they decided to set up a monarchy and name a king. And the man
they most wanted to rule, of course, was the fair-minded Deioces. He was
hard to convince, for he wanted nothing more to do with the villages' in­
fighting and bickering, but the Medes begged and pleaded-without him the
country had descended into astate of lawlessness. Deioces finally agreed.
Yet he also imposed conditions. An enormous palace was to be con­
structed for him, he was to be provided with bodyguards, and a capital city
was to be built from which he could rule. All of this was done, and Deioces
settled into his palace. In the center of the capital, the palace was sur­
rounded by walls, and completely inaccessible to ordinary people. Deioces
then established the terms of his rule: Admission to his presence was for­
bidden. Communication with the king was only possible through messen­
gers. No one in the royal court could see him more than once a week, and
then only by permission.
Deioces ruled for fifty-three years, extended the Medean empire, and
established the foundation for what would later be the Persian empire,
under his great-great-grandson Cyrus. During Deioces' reign, the people's
118 LAW 16

[PAGE 143]
respect for hirn gradually tumed into a form of worship: He was not a mere
mortal, they believed, but the son of a god.
Interpretation
Deioces was a man of great ambition. He determined early on that the
country needed a strong ruler, and that he was the man for the job.
In aland plagued with anarchy, the most powerful man is the judge
and arbiter. So Deioces began his career by making his reputation as a man
of impeccable fairness.
At the height of his power as a judge, however, Deioces realized the
truth of the law of absence and presence: By serving so many clients, he
had become too noticeable, too available, and had lost the respect he had
earlier enjoyed. People were taking his services for granted. The only way
to regain the veneration and power he wanted was to withdraw com­
pletely, and let the Medes taste what life was like without hirn. As he ex­
pected, they came begging for hirn to rule.
Once Deioces had discovered the truth of this law, he carried it to its
ultimate realization. In the palace his people had built for hirn, none could
see hirn except a few courtiers, and those only rarely. As Herodotus wrote,
"There was a risk that if they saw him habitually, it might lead to jealousy
and resentment, and plots would follow; but if nobody saw hirn, the legend
would grow that he was a being of a different order from mere men."
A man said to a Dervish: ""Why do I not see you more often ?" The Dervish
replied, "Because the words '"Why have you not been to see me?' are
sweeter to my ear than the words '"Why have you come again?'"
Mulla Jami, quoted in ldries Shah 's Caravan 01' Dreams, 1968
KEYS TO POWER
Everything in the world depends on absence and presence. A strong pres­
ence will draw power and attention to you-you shine more brightly than
those around you. But a point is inevitably reached where too much pres­
ence creates the opposite effect: The more you are seen and heard from,
the more your value degrades. You become a habit. No matter how hard
you try to be different, subtly, without your knowing why, people respect
you less and less. At the right moment you must leam to withdraw yourself
before they unconsciously push you away. It is agame of hide-and-seek.
The truth of this law can most easily be appreciated in matters of love
and seduction. In the beginning stages of an affair, the lover's absence stim­
ulates your imagination, forming a sort of aura around hirn or her. But this
aura fades when you know too much-when your imagination no longer
has room to roam. The loved one becomes a person like anyone else, a
person whose presence is taken for granted. This is why the seventeenth­
century French courtesan Ninon de Lenclos advised constant feints at with­
drawal from one's lover. "Love never dies of starvation," she wrote, "but
often of indigestion. "
LAW 16 119

[PAGE 144]
The moment you allow yourself to be treated like anyone else, it is too
late-you are swallowed and digested. To prevent this you need to starve
the other person of your presence. Force their respect by threatenir1g them
with the possibility that they will lose you far good; create a pattern of pres­
ence and absence.
Once you die, everything about you will seem different You will be
surrounded by an instant aura of respect. People will remember their criti­
cisms of you, their arguments with you, and will be filled with regret and
guilt. They are rnissing a presence that will never return. But you do not
have to wait until you die: By completely withdrawing for a while, you cre­
ate a kind of death before death. And when you come back, it will be as if
you had come back from the dead-an air of resurrection will ding to you,
and people will be relieved at your return. This is how Deioces made him­
selfking.
Napoleon was recognizing the law of absence and presence when he
said, "If I am often seen at the theater, people will cease to notice me."
Today, in a world inundated with presence through the flood of images, the
game of withdrawal is all the more powerful. We rarely know when to
withdraw anymore, and nothing seems private, so we are awed by anyone
who is able to disappear by choice. Novelists J. D. Salinger and Thomas
Pynchon have created cultlike followings by knowing when to disappear.
Another, more everyday side of this law, but one that demonstrates
its truth even further, is the law of scarcity in the science of economics.
By withdrawing something from the market, you create instant value. In
seventeenth-century Holland, the upper classes wanted to make the tulip
more than just a beautiful flower-they wanted it to be a kind of status sym­
bol. Making the flower scarce, indeed almost impossible to obtain, they
sparked what was later called tulipomania. A single flower was now worth
more than its weight in gold. In our own century, similarly, the art dealer
Joseph Duveen insisted on making the paintings he sold as scarce and rare
as possible. To keep their prices elevated and their status high, he bought up
whole collections and stored them in his basement. The paintings that he
sold became more than just paintings-t-hey were felish objects, their value
increased by their rarity. "You can get all the pictures you want at fifty thou­
sand dollars apiece-that's easy," he once said. "But to get pictures at a
quarter of a million apiece-that wants doing!"

make people demand your return.
120 LAW 16

[PAGE 145]
Extend the law of scarcity to your own skills. Make what you are offer­
ing the world rare and hard to find, and you instantly increase its value.
There always comes a moment when those in power overstay their
welcome. We have grown tired of them, lost respect for them; we see them
as no different from the rest of mankind, which is to say that we see them as
rather worse, since we inevitably compare their current status in our eyes
to their former one. There is an art to knowing when to retire. If it is done
right, you regain the respect you had lost, and retain a part of your power.
The greatest mler of the sixteenth century was Charles V. King of
Spain, Hapsburg emperor, he governed an empire that at one point in­
cluded much of Europe and the New World. Yet at the height of his power,
in 1557, he retired to the monastery of Yuste. All of Europe was captivated
by his sudden withdrawal; people who had hated and feared hirn suddenly
called hirn great, and he came to be seen as a saint. In more recent times,
the film actress Greta Garbo was never more admired than when she re­
tired, in 1941. For some her absence came too soon-she was in her mid­
thirties-but she wisely preferred to leave on her own terms, rather than
waiting for her audience to grow tired of her.
Make yourself too available and the aura of power you have created
around yourself will wear away. Turn the game around: Make yourself less
accessible and you increase the value of your presence.
Authority:
Use absence to create
respect and esteern. If presence
diminishes farne, absence augments it.
A man who when absent is regarded as a
lion becomes when present so me thing com­
mon and ridiculous. Talents lose their luster
if we become too familiar with them, for the
outer shell of the mind is more readily seen
than its rich inner kernel. Even the outstand-
ing genius makes use of retirement so that
men rnay honor hirn and so that the
yearning aroused by his absence
rnay cause hirn to be esteerned.
(Baltasar Graciän,
1601-1658)
LAW 16 121

[PAGE 146]
REVERSAL
This law only applies once a certain level of power has been attained. The
need to withdraw only comes after you have established your presence;
leave too early and you do not increase YOUf respect, you are simply for­
gotten. When you are first entering onto the world's stage, create an image
that is recognizable, reproducible, and is seen everywhere. Until that status
is attained, absence is dangerous-instead of fanning the flarnes, it will ex­
tinguish them.
In love and seduction, similarly, absence is only effective once you
have sUfrounded the other with YOUf image, been seen by hirn or her
everywhere. Everything must remind YOUf lover of your presence, so that
when you do choose to be away, the lover will always be thinking of you,
will always be seeing you in his or her mind's eye.
Remember: In the beginning, make yourself not scarce but om­
nipresent. Only what is seen, appreciated, and loved will be missed in its
absence.

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
In May of 1972, chess champion Boris Spassky anxiously awaited his riyal
Bobby Fischer in Reykjavik, Iceland. The two men had been scheduled to
meet for the World Championship of Chess, but Fischer had not arrived on
time and the match was on hold. Fischer had problems with the size of the
prize money, problems with the way the money was to be distributed,
problems with the logistics of holding the match in Iceland. He might back
out at any moment.
Spassky tried to be patient. His Russian bosses feit that Fischer was hu­
miliating him and told him to walk away, but Spassky wanted this match.
He knew he could destroy Fischer, and nothing was going to spoil the
greatest victory of his career. "So it seems that all OUT work may come to
nothing," Spassky told a comrade. "But what can we do? It is Bobby's
move. If he comes, we play. If he does not come; we do not play. A man
who is willing to commit suicide has the initiative."
Fischer finally arrived in Reykjavik, but the problems, and the threat
of cancellation, continued. He disliked the hall where the match was to be
fought, he criticized the lighting, he complained about the noise of the
cameras, he even hated the chairs in which he and Spassky were to sit.
Now the Soviet Union took the initiative and threatened to withdraw their
man.
The bluff apparently worked: After all the weeks of waiting, the end­
less and infuriating negotiations, Fischer agreed to play. Everyone was re­
lieved, no one more than Spassky. But on the day of the official
introductions, Fischer arrived very late, and on the day when the "Match
of the Century" was to begin, he was late again. This time, however, the
consequences would be dire: If he showed up too late he would forfeit the
first game. What was going on? Was he playing some sort of mind game?
Or was Bobby Fischer perhaps afraid ofBoris Spassky? It seemed to the as­
sembled grand masters, and to Spassky, that this young kid from Brooklyn
had a terrible case of the jitters. At 5:09 Fischer showed up, exactly one
minute before the match was to be canceled.
The first game of a chess toumament is critical, since it sets the tone for
the months to come. It is often a slow and quiet struggle, with the two play­
ers preparing themselves for the war and trying to read each other's strate­
gies. This game was different. Fischer made a terrible move early on,
perhaps the worst of his career, and when Spassky had hirn on the ropes,
he seemed to give up. Yet Spassky knew that Fischer never gave up. Even
when facing checkmate, he fought to the bitter end, wearing the opponent
down. This time, though, he seemed resigned. Then suddenly he broke out
a bold move that put the room in a buzz. The move shocked Spassky, but
he recovered and managed to win the game. But no one could figure out
what Fischer was up to. Had he lost deliberately? Or was he rattled? Unset­
tled? Even, as some thought, insane?
After his defeat in the first game, Fischer complained all the more
loudly about the room, the cameras, and everything else. He also failed to
124 LAW 17

[PAGE 149]
show up on time for the second game. This time the organizers had had
enough: He was given a forfeit. Now he was down two games to none, a
position from which no one had ever come back to win a chess champi­
onship. Fischer was clearly unhinged. Yet in the third game, as all those
who witnessed it remember, he had a ferocious look in his eye, a look that
clearly bothered Spassky. And despite the hole he had dug for hirnself, he
seemed supremely confident. He did make what appeared to be another
blunder, as he had in the first game-but his cocky air made Spassky smell
a trap. Yet despite the Russian's suspicions, he could not figure out the trap,
and before he knew it Fischer had checkmated hirn. In fact Fischer's un­
orthodox tactics had completely unnerved his opponent. At the end of the
game, Fischer leaped up and rushed out, yelling to his confederates as he
smashed a fist into his palm, "I'm crushing him with brute force!"
In the next games Fischer pulled moves that no one had seen from
hirn before, moves that were not his style. Now Spassky started to make
blunders. After losing the sixth game, he started to cry. One grand master
said, "Mter this, Spassky's got to ask hirnself if it's safe to go back to Rus­
sia." After the eighth game Spassky decided he knew what was happening:
Bobby Fischer was hypnotizing hirn. He decided not to look Fischer in the
eye; he lost anyway.
After the fourteenth game he called a staff conference and announced,
"An attempt is being made to control my mind." He wondered whether the
orange juice they drank at the chess table could have been drugged.
Maybe chemicals were being blown into the air. Finally Spassky went pub­
Hc, accusing the Fischer team of putting something in the chairs that was al­
tering Spassky's mind. The KGB went on alert: Boris Spassky was
embarrassing the Soviet Union!
The chairs were taken apart and X-rayed. A chemist found nothing
unusual in them. The only things anyone found anywhere, in fact, were
two dead flies in a Hghting fixture. Spassky began to complain of hallucina­
tions. He tried to keep playing, but his mind was unraveling. He could not
go on. On September 2, he resigned. Although still relatively young, he
never recovered from this defeat.
Interpretation
In previous games between Fischer and Spassky, Fischer had not fared
weIl. Spassky had an uncanny ability to read his opponent's strategy and
use it against hirn. Adaptable and patient, he would build attacks that would
defeat not in seven moves but in seventy. He defeated Fischer every time
they played because he saw much further ahead, and because he was a bril­
Hant psychologist who never lost control. One master said, "He doesn't just
look for the best move. He looks for the move that will disturb the man he
is playing."
Fischer, however, finaHy understood thll;t this was one of the keys to
Spassky's success: He played on your predictability, defeated you at your
own game. Everything Fischer did for the championship match was an at-
LAW 17 125

[PAGE 150]
tempt to put the initiative on his side and to keep Spassky off-balance.
Clearly the endless waiting had an effect on Spassky's psyche. Most power­
ful of all, though, were Fischer's deliberate blunders and his appearance of
having no clear strategy. In fact, he was doing everything he could to
scramble his old patterns, even if it meant losing the first match and forfeit­
ing the second.
Spassky was known for his sangfroid and levelheadedness, but for the
first time in his life he could not figure out his opponent. He slowly melted
down, until at the end he was the one who seemed insane.
Chess contains the concentrated essence of life: First, because to win
you have to be supremely patient and farseeing; and second, because the
game is built on patterns, whole sequences of moves that have been played
before and will be played again, with slight alterations, in any one match.
Your opponent analyzes the patterns you are playing and uses them to try
to fore see your moves. Allowing hirn nothing predictable to base his strat­
egy on gives you a big advantage. In chess as in life, when people cannot
figure out what you are doing, they are kept in a state of terror-waiting,
uncertain, confused.
Life at court is a serious, melancholy game of chess, which requires us to draw
up our pieces and batteries, form a plan, pursue it, parry that of our
adversary. Sometimes, however, it is better to take risks
and play the most capricious, unpredictable move.
leall de La Bmyere, 1645-1696
KEYS TO POWER
Nothing is more terrifying than the sudden and unpredictable. That is why
we are so frightened by earthquakes and tornadoes: We do not know when
they will strike. Mter one has occurred, we wait in terror for the next one.
To a lesser degree, this is the effect that unpredictable human behavior has
on uso
Animals behave in set patterns, which is why we are able to hunt and
kill them. Only man has the capacity to consciously alter his behavior, to
improvise and overcome the weight of routine and habit. Yet most men do
not realize this power. They prefer the comforts of routine, of giving in to
the animal nature that has them repeating the same compulsive actions
time and time again. They do this because it requires no effort, and be­
cause they mistakenly believe that if they do not unsettle others, they will
be left alone. Understand: A person of power instills a kind of fear by delib­
erately unsettling those around hirn to keep the initiative on his side. You
sometimes need to strike without warning, to make others tremble when
they least expect it. It is a device that the powerful have used for centuries.
Filippo Maria, the last of the Visconti dukes of Milan in fifteenth­
century Italy, consciously did the opposite of what everyone expected of
hirn. For instance, he might suddenly shower a courtier with attention, and
then, once the man had come to expect a promotion to higher office,
126 LAW 17

[PAGE 151]
would suddenly start treating hirn with the utmost disdain. Confused, the
man might leave the court, when the duke would suddenly recall hirn and
start treating hirn weIl again. Doubly confused, the courtier would wonder
whether his assumption that he would be promoted had become obvious,
and offensive, to the duke, and would start to behave as if he no longer ex­
pected such honor. The duke would rebuke hirn for his lack of ambition
and would send hirn away.
The secret of dealing with Filippo was simple: Do not presume to
know what he wants. Do not try to guess what will please hirn. Never inject
your will; just surrender to his will. Then wait to see what happens. Amidst
the confusion and uncertainty he created, the duke ruled supreme, unchal­
lenged and at peace.
Unpredictability is most often the tactic of the master, but the under­
dog too can use it to great effect. If you find yourself outnumbered or cor­
nered, throw in aseries of unpredictable moves. Your enemies will be so
confused that they will pull back or make a tactical blunder.
In the spring of 1862, during the American Civil War, General
StonewallJackson and a force of 4,600 Confederate soldiers were torment­
ing the larger Union forces in the Shenandoah Valley. Meanwhile, not far
away, General George Brinton McClellan, heading a force of 90,000
Union soldiers, was marching south from Washington, D.C., to lay siege to
Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital. As the weeks of the cam­
paign went by, Jackson repeatedly led his soldiers out of the Shenandoah
Valley, then back to it.
His movements made no sense. Was he preparing to help defend
Richmond? Was he marching on Washington, now that McClellan's ab­
sence had left it unprotected? Was he heading north to wreak havoc up
there? Why was his small force moving in circles?
Jackson's inexplicable moves made the Union generals delay the
march on Richmond as they waited to figure out what he was up to. Mean­
while, the South was able to pour reinforcements into the town. A battle
that could have crushed the Confederacy tumed into a stalemate. Jackson
used this tactic time and again when facing numerically superior forces.
"Always mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy, if possible," he said,
". . . s uch tactics will win every time and a small army may thus destroy a
large one."
This law applies not only to war but to everyday situations. People are
always trying to read the motives behind your actions and to use your pre­
dictability against you. Throw in a completely inexplicable move and you
put them on the defensive. Because they do not und erstand you, they are
unnerved, and in such astate you can easily intimidate them.
Pablo Picasso once remarked, "The best calculation is the absence of
calculation. Once you have attained a certain level of recognition, others
generally figure that when you do something, it's for an intelligent reason.
So it's really foolish to plot out your movements too carefully in advance.
You're better off acting capriciously."
For a while, Picasso worked with the art dealer Paul Rosenberg. At first
LAW 17 127

[PAGE 152]
he allowed hirn a fair amount of latitude in handling his paintings, then one
day, for no apparent reason, he told the man he would no longer give hirn
any work to seIl. As Picasso explained, "Rosenberg would spend the next
forty-eight hours trying to figure out why. Was I reserving things for some
other dealer? I'd go on working and sleeping and Rosenberg would spend
his time figuring. In two days he'd come back, nerves jangled, anxious, say­
ing, 'After all, dear friend, you wouldn't turn me down if I offered you this
much [naming a substantially higher figure] for those paintings rather than
the price I've been accustomed to paying you, would you?' "
Unpredictability is not only a weapon of terror: Scrambling YOUf pat­
terns on a day-to-day basis will cause a stir around you and stimulate inter­
est. People will talk about you, ascribe motives and explanations that have
nothing to do with the truth, but that keep you constantly in their minds. In
the end, the more capricious you appear, the more respect you will gamer.
Only the terminally subordinate act in a predictable manner.

REVERSAL
Sometimes predictability can work in your favor: By creating a pattern for
people to be familiar and comfortable with, you can lull them to sleep.
They have prepared everything according to their preconceived notions
about you. You can use this in several ways: First, it sets up a smoke screen,
a comfortable front behind which you can carry on deceptive actions. Sec­
ond, it allows you on rare occasions to do something completely against
the pattern, unsettling YOUf opponent so deeply he will fall to the ground
without being pushed.
In 1974 Muhammad Ali and George Foreman were scheduled to fight
for the world heavyweight boxing championship. Everyone knew what
would happen: Big George Foreman would try to land a knockout punch
while Ali would dance around hirn, wearing hirn out. That was Ali's way of
fighting, his pattern, and he had not changed it in more than ten years. But
in this case it seemed to give Foreman the advantage: He had a devastating
punch, and if he waited, sooner or later Ali would have to come to hirn.
Ali, the master strategist, had other plans: In press conferences before the
big fight, he said he was going to change his style and punch it out with
Foreman. No one, least of all Foreman, believed this for a second. That
plan would be suicide on Ali's part; he was playing the comedian, as usual.
Then, before the fight, Ali's trainer loosened the ropes around the ring,
something a trainer would do if his boxer were intending to slug it out. But
no one believed this ploy; it had to be a setup.
To everyone's amazement, Ali did exactly what he had said he would
do. As Foreman waited for hirn to dance around, Ali went right up to hirn
and slugged it out. He completely upset his opponent's strategy. At a loss,
Foreman ended up wearing hirnself out, not by chasing Ali but by throw­
ing punches wildly, and taking more and more counterpunches. Finally,
Ali landed a dramatic right cross that knocked out Foreman. The habit of
assuming that a person's behavior will fit its previous patterns is so strong
that not even Ali's announcement of a strategy change was enough to upset

A warning: Unpredictability can work against you sometimes, es­
pecially if you are in a subordinate position. There are times when it is bet­
ter to let people feel comfortable and settled around you than to disturb
them. Too much unpredictability will be seen as a sign of indecisiveness, or
even of some more serious psychic problem. Patterns are powerful, and
you can terrify people by disrupting them. Such power should only be
used judiciously.

LAW 18 1.13

[PAGE 158]
Because humans are social creatures by nature, power depends on so­
cial interaction and circulation. To make yourself powerful you must place
yourself at the center of things, as Louis XIV did at Versailles. All activity
should revolve around you, and you should be aware of everything hap­
pening on the street, and of anyone who might be hatching plots against
you. The danger for most people comes when they feel threatened. In such
times they tend to retreat and elose ranks, to find security in a kind of
fortress. In doing so, however, they come to rely for information on a
smaller and smaller cirele, and lose perspective on events around them.
They lose maneuverability and become easy targets, and their isolation
makes them paranoid. As in warfare and most games of strategy, isolation
often precedes defeat and death.
In moments of uncertainty and danger, you need to fight this desire to
turn inward. Instead, make yourself more accessible, seek out old allies and
make new ones, force yourself into more and more different cireles. This
has been the trick of powerful people for centuries.
The Roman statesman Cicero was born into the lower nobility, and
had little chance of power unless he managed to make a place for himself
among the aristocrats who controlled the city. He succeeded brilliantly,
identifying everyone with influence and figuring out how they were con­
nected to one another. He mingled everywhere, knew everyone, and had
such a vast network of connections that an enemy here could easily be
counterbalanced by an ally there.
The French statesman Talleyrand played the game the same way. Al­
though he came from one of the oldest aristocratic families in France, he
made a point of always staying in touch with what was happening in the
streets of Paris, allowing him to foresee trends and troubles. He even got a
certain pleasure out of mingling with shady criminal types, who supplied
him with valuable information. Every time there was a crisis, a transition of
power-the end of the Directory, the fall of Napoleon, the abdication of
Louis XVIII-he was able to survive and even thrive, because he never
elosed himself up in a small cirele but always forged connections with the
neworder.
This law pertains to kings and queens, and to those of the highest
power: The moment you lose contact with your people, seeking security in
isolation, rebellion is brewing. Never imagine yourself so elevated that you
can afford to cut yourself off from even the lowest echelons. By retreating
to a fortress, you make yourself an easy target for your plotting subjects,
who view your isolation as an insult and a reason for rebellion.
Since humans are such social creatures, it follows that the social arts
that make us pleasant to be around can be practiced only by constant ex­
posure and circulation. The more you are in contact with others, the more
graceful and at ease you become. Isolation, on the other hand, engenders
an awkwardness in your gestures, and leads to further isolation, as people
start avoiding you.
In 1545 Duke Cosimo I de' Medici decided that to ensure the immor-
134 LAW 18

[PAGE 159]
tality of his name he would commission frescoes for the main chapel of the
church of San Lorenzo in Florence. He had many great painters to choose
from, and in the end he picked J acopo da Pontormo. Getting on in years,
Pontormo wanted to make these frescoes his chef d'oeuvre and legacy. His
first decision was to elose the chapel off with walls, partitions, and blinds.
He wanted no one to witness the creation of his masterpiece, or to steal his
ideas. He would outdo Michelangelo hirns elf. When some young men
broke into the chapel out of curiosity, J acopo sealed it off even further.
Pontormo filled the chapel's ceiling with biblical scenes-the Creation,
Adam and Eve, Noah's ark, on and on. At the top of the middle wall he
painted Christ in his majesty, raising the dead on Judgment Day. The artist
worked on the chapel for eleven years, rarely leaving it, since he had de­
veloped a phobia for human contact and was afraid his ideas would be
stolen.
Pontormo died before completing the frescoes, and none of them has
survived. But the great Renaissance writer Vasari, a friend of Pontormo's
who saw the frescoes shortly after the artist's death, left a description of
what they looked like. There was a total lack of proportion. Scenes
bumped against scenes, figures in one story being juxtaposed with those in
another, in maddening numbers. Pontormo had become obsessed with de­
tail but had lost any sense of the overall composition. Vasari left off his de­
scription of the frescoes by writing that if he continued, "I think I would go
mad and become entangled in this painting, just as I believe that in the
eleven years of time Jacopo spent on it, he entangled hirnself and anyone
else who saw it." 1nstead of crowning Pontormo's career, the work became
his undoing.
These frescoes were visual equivalents of the effects of isolation on the
human mind: a loss of proportion, an obsession with detail combined with
an inability to see the larger picture, a kind of extravagant ugliness that no
longer communicates. Clearly, isolation is as deadly for the creative arts as
for the social arts. Shakespeare is the most famous writer in history be­
cause, as a dramatist for the popular stage, he opened hirns elf up to the
masses, making his work accessible to people no matter what their educa­
tion and taste. Artists who hole themselves up in their fortress lose a sense
of proportion, their work communicating only to their small circle. Such
art remains comered and powerless.
Finally, since power is a human creation, it is inevitably increased by
contact with other people. 1nstead of falling into the fortress mentality,
view the world in the following manner: 1t is like a vast Versailles, with
every room communicating with another. You need to be permeable, able
to float in and out of different circles and mix with different types. That
kind of mobility and social contact will protect you from plotters, who will
be unable to keep secrets from you, and from YOUf enemies, who will be
unable to isolate you from yoUf allies. Always on the move, you mix and
mingle in the rooms of the palace, never sitting or settling in one place. No
hunter can fix his aim on such a swift-moving creature.

REVERSAL
It is hardly ever right and propitious to choose isolation. Without keeping
an ear on what is happening in the streets, you will be unable to protect
YOUfself. About the only thing that constant human contact cannot facili­
tate is thought. The weight of society's pressure to conform, and the lack of
distance from other people, can make it impossible to think clearly ahout
what is going on around you. As a temporary reCOUfse, then, isolation can
help you to gain perspective. Many a serious thinker has heen produced in
prisons, where we have nothing to do but think. Machiavelli could write
The Prince only once he found hirnself in exile and isolated on a farm far
from the political intrigues of Florence.
The danger is, however, that this kind of isolation will sire all kinds of
strange and perverted ideas. You may gain perspective on the larger pic­
ture, hut you lose a sense of your own smallness and limitations. Also, the
more isolated you are, the harder it is to break out of YOUf isolation when
you choose to-it sinks you deep into its quicksand without your noticing.
If you need time to think, then, choose isolation only as a last resort, and
only in small doses. Be careful to keep YOUf way hack into society open.

In the late 1910s some of the best swindlers in America formed a con-artist
ring based in Denver, Colorado. In the winter months they would spread
across the southern states, plying their trade. In 1920 Joe Furey, aleader of
the ring, was working his way through Texas, making hundreds of thou­
sands of dollars with classic con games. In Fort Worth, he met a sucker
named J. Frank Norfleet, a cattleman who owned a large ranch. Norfleet

Interpretation
Most men accept the humiliation of being conned with a sense of resigna­
tion. They leam their lesson, recognizing that there is no such thing as a
free lunch, and that they have usually been brought down by their own
greed for easy money. Some, however, refuse to take their medicine. In­
stead of reflecting on their own gullibility and avarice, they see themselves
as totally innocent victims.
Men like this may seem to be crusaders for justice and honesty, but
they are actually immoderately insecure. Being fooled, being conned, has
activated their self-doubt, and they are desperate to repair the damage.
Were the mortgage on Norfleet's ranch, the collapse of his marriage, and
the years of borrowing money and living in cheap hotels worth his revenge
over his embarrassment at being fleeced? To the Norfleets of the world,
overcoming their embarrassment is worth any price.
All people have insecurities, and often the best way to deceive a sucker
is to play upon his insecurities. But in the realm of power, everything is a
question of degree, and the person who is decidedly more insecure than
the average mortal presents great dangers. Be wamed: If you practice de­
eeption or trickery of any sort, study your mark weIl. Some people's inse­
eurity and ego fragility cannot tolerate the slightest offense. To see if you
are dealing with such a type, test them first-make, say, a mild joke at their
expense. A confident person williaugh; an overly insecure one will react as
if personally insulted. If you suspect you are dealing with this type, find an­
other victim.
Transgression III
In the fifth century B.C., Ch'ung-erh, the prince of Ch'in (in present-day
China), had been forced into exile. He lived modestly-even, sometimes,
in poverty-waiting for the time when he could return horne and resurne
his princely life. Once he was passing through the state of Cheng, where
the mler, not knowing who he was, treated hirn rudely. The ruler's minis­
ter, Shu Chan, saw this and said, "This man is a worthy prince. May Your
Highness treat hirn with great courtesy and thereby place hirn under an
obligation!" But the ruler, able to see only the prince's lowly station, ig­
nored this advice and insulted the prince again. Shu Chan again warned
his master, saying, "If Your Highness cannot treat Ch'ung-erh with cour­
tesy, you should put hirn to death, to avoid calamity in the future." The
mler only scoffed.
Years later, the prince was finally able to return horne, his circum­
stances greatly changed. He did not forget who had been kind to hirn, and
LAW 19 141

[PAGE 166]
who had been insolent, during his years of poverty. Least of a1l did he for­
get his treatment at the hands of the ruler of Cheng. At his first opportunity
he assembled a vast army and marched on Cheng, taking eight eities, de­
stroying the kingdom, and sending the ruler into an exile of his own.
Interpretation
You can never be sure who you are dealing with. A man who is of litde im­
portance and me ans today can be a person of power tomorrow. We forget
a lot in our lives, but we rarely forget an insult
How was the ruler of Cheng to know that Prince Ch'ung-erh was an
ambitious, calculating, cunning type, a serpent with a long memory? There
was really no way for him to know, you may say-but since there was no
way, it would have been better not to tempt the fates by finding out. There
is nothing to be gained by insulting a person unnecessarily. Swa1low the
impulse to offend, even if the other person seems weak. The satisfaction is
meager compared to the danger that someday he or she will be in a posi­
tion to hurt you.
Transgression IV
The year of 1920 had been a particularly bad one for American art dealers.
Big buyers-the robber-baron generation of the previous century-were
getting to an age where they were dying off like flies, and no new rnillion­
aires had emerged to take their place. Things were so bad that a number of
the major dealers decided to pool their resources, an unheard-of event,
since art dealers usually get along like cats and dogs.
Joseph Duveen, art dealer to the richest tycoons of America, was suf­
fering more than the others that year, so he deeided to go along with this
alilance. The group now consisted of the five biggest dealers in the country.
Looking around for a new client, they deeided that their last best hope was
Henry Ford, then the wealthiest man in America. Ford had yet to venture
into the art market, and he was such a big target that it made sense for them
to work together.
The dealers deeided to assemble a list, "The 100 Greatest Paintings in
the World" (a1l of which they happened to have in stock), and to offer the
lot of them to Ford. With one purchase he could make himself the world's
greatest collector. The consortium worked for weeks to produce a magnifi­
cent object: a three-volume set of books containing beautiful reproductions
of the paintings, as well as scholarly texts accompanying each picture. Next
they made a personal visit to Ford at his home in Dearbom, Michigan.
There they were surprised by the simplicity of his house: Mr. Ford was ob­
viously an extremely unaffected man.
Ford received them in his study. Looking through the book, he ex­
pressed astonishment and delight. The exeited dealers began imagining the
millions of dollars that would short1y flow into their coffers. Fina1ly, how­
ever, Ford looked up from the book and said, "Gendemen, beautiful books
like these, with beautiful colored pictures like these, must cost an awful
lot!" "But Mr. Ford!" exclaimed Duveen, "we don't expect you to buy these
142 LAW 19

[PAGE 167]
books. We got them up especially for you, to show you the pietures. These
books are a present to you." Ford seemed puzzled. "Gentlemen," he said,
"it is extremely nice of you, but I really don't see how I can accept a beau­
tiful, expensive present like this from strangers." Duveen explained to Ford
that the reproductions in the books showed paintings they had hoped to
seIl to hirn. Ford finally understood. "But gentlemen," he exclaimed, "what
would I want with the original pietures when the ones right here in these
books are so beautiful?"
Interpretation
Joseph Duveen prided hirnself on studying his victims and clients in ad­
vance, figuring out their weaknesses and the peculiarities of their tastes be­
fore he ever met them. He was driven by desperation to drop this tactic just
once, in his assault on Henry Ford. It took hirn months to recover from his
misjudgment, both mentally and monetarily. Ford was the unassuming
plain-man type who just isn't worth the bother. He was the incarnation of
those literal-minded folk who do not possess enough imagination to be de­
eeived. From then on, Duveen saved his energies for the Mellons and Mor­
gans of the world-men crafty enough for hirn to entrap in his snares.
KEYS TO POWER
The ability to meaSUfe people and to know who you're dealing with is the
most important skill of all in gathering and conserving power. Without it
you are blind: Not only will you offe nd the wrong people, you will choose
the wrong types to work on, and will think you are flattering people when
you are actually insulting them. Before embarking on any move, take the
measure of YOUf mark or potential opponent. Otherwise you will waste
time and make mistakes. Study people's weaknesses, the chinks in their
anon r, their areas ofboth pride and insecurity. Know their ins and outs be­
fore you even decide whether or not to deal with them.
Two final words of caution: First, in judging and measuring your oppo­
nent, never rely on your instincts. You will make the greatest mistakes of all
if you rely on such inexact indicators. Nothing can substitute for gathering
eonerete knowledge. Study and spy on YOUf opponent for however long it
takes; this will pay off in the long run.
Second, never trust appearances. Anyone with a serpent's heart can
use a show of kindness to cloak it; a person who is blustery on the outside is
often really a coward. Leam to see through appearances and their contra­
c1ietions. Never trust the version that people give of themselves-it is ut­
terly unreliable.

If you allow people to feel they possess you to any degree, you lose all power

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
When Queen Elizabeth I ascended the throne of England, in 1558, there
was much to-do about her finding a husband. The issue was debated in Par­
liament, and was a main topic of conversation among Englishmen of all
classes; they often disagreed as to whom she should marry, but everyone
thought she should marry as soon as possible, for a queen must have a
king, and must bear heirs for the kingdom. The debates raged on for years.
Meanwhile the most handsome and eligible bachelors in the re alm-Sir
Robert Dudley, the Earl of Essex, Sir Walter Raleigh-vied for Elizabeth's
hand. She did not discourage them, but she seemed to be in no hurry, and
her hints as to which man might be her favorite often contradicted each
other. In 1566, Parliament sent a delegation to Elizabeth urging her to
marry before she was too old to bear children. She did not argue, nor did
she discourage the delegation, but she remained a virgin nonetheless.
The delicate game that Elizabeth played with her suitors slowly made
her the subject of innumerable sexual fantasies and the object of cultish
worship. The court physician, Simon Forman, used his diary to describe
his dreams of deflowering her. Painters represented her as Diana and other
goddesses. The poet Edmund Spenser a'"'d others wrote eulogies to the Vir­
gin Queen. She was referred to as "thc world's Empresse," "that virtuous
Virgo" who rules the world and sets the stars in motion. In conversation
with her, her many male suitors would employ bold sexual innuendo, a
dare that Elizabeth did not discourage. She did an she could to stir their in­
terest and simultaneously keep them at bay.
Throughout Europe, kings and princes knew that a marriage with Eliz­
abeth would seal an alliance between England and any nation. The king of
Spain wooed her, as did the prince of Sweden and the archduke of Austria.
She politely refused them alt
The great diplomatie issue of Elizabeth's day was posed by the revolt
of the Flemish and Dutch Lowlands, which were then possessions of Spain.
Should England break its alliance with Spain and choose France as its main
ally on the Continent, thereby encouraging Flemish and Dutch indepen­
dence? By 1570 it had come to seem that an alliance with France would be
England's wisest course. France had two eligible men of noble blood, the
dukes of Anjou and Alenc;on, brothers of the French king. Would either of
them marry Elizabeth? Both had advantages, and Elizabeth kept the hopes
of both alive. The issue simmered for years. The duke of Anjou made sev-
146 LAW 20

[PAGE 171]
eral visits to England, kissed Elizabeth in public, even called her by pet
names; she appeared to requite his affections. Meanwhile, as she flirted
with the two brothers, a treaty was signed that sealed peace between
France and England. By 1582 Elizabeth feit she could break off the
courtship. In the case of the duke of Anjou in particular, she did so with
great relief: For the sake of diplomacy she had aHowed herself to be
courted by a man whose presence she could not stand and whom she
found physically repulsive. Once peace between France and England was
secure, she dropped the unctuous duke as politely as she could.
By this time Elizabeth was too old to bear children. She was accord­
ingly able to live the rest of her life as she desired, and she died the Vrrgin
Queen. She left no direct heir, but mIed through aperiod of incomparable
peace and cultural fertility.
Interpretation
Elizabeth had good reason not to marry: She had witnessed the mistakes of
Mary Queen of Scots, her cousin. Resisting the idea of being mIed by a
woman, the Scots expected Mary to marry and marry wisely. To wed a for­
eigner would be unpopular; to favor any particular noble house would
open up terrible rivalries. In the end Mary chose Lord Damley, a Catholic.
In doing so she incurred the wrath of Scotland's Protestants, and endless
turmoil ensued.
Elizabeth knew that marriage can often lead to a female mler's undo­
ing: By marrying and committing to an alliance with one party or nation,
the queen becomes embroiled in conflicts that are not of her choosing, con­
fliets which may eventually overwhelm her or lead her into a futile war.
Also, the husband becomes the de facto mler, and often tries to do away
with his wife the queen, as Damley tried to get rid of Mary. Elizabeth
learned the lesson weH. She had two goals as amier: to a--oid marriage and
to avoid war. She managed to combine these goals by t.n...: gling the possi­
bility of marriage in order to forge alliances. The moment she committed
to any single suitor would have been the moment she lost her power. She
had to emanate mystery and desirability, never discouraging anyone's
hopes but never yielding.
Through this lifelong game of flirting and withdrawing, Elizabeth
dominated the country and every man who sought to conquer her. As the
center of attention, she was in contro!. Keeping her independence above
all, Elizabeth protected her power and made herself an object of worship.
I would rather be a beggar and single than a queen and married.
Queen Elizabeth I, 1533-1603
KEYS TO POWER
Since power depends greatly on appearances, you must leam the tricks
that will enhance your image. Refusing to commit to a person or group is
one of these. When you hold yourself back, you incur not anger but a kind
LAW 20 147

[PAGE 172]
of respect. You instantly seem powerful because you make yourself un­
graspable, rather than succumbing to the group, or to the relationship, as
most people do. This aura of power only grows with time: As your reputa­
tion for independence grows, more and more people will come to desire
you, wanting to be the one who gets you to commit. Desire is like a virus: If
we see that someone is desired by other people, we tend to find this person
desirable too.
The moment you commit, the magic is gone. You become like every­
one else. People will try all kinds of underhanded methods to get you to
commit. They will give you gifts, shower you with favors, all to put you
under obligation. Encourage the attention, stimulate their interest, but do
not commit at any cost. Accept the gifts and favors if you so desire, but be
careful to maintain your inner aloofness. You cannot inadvertently allow
yourself to feel obligated to anyone.
Remember, though: The goal is not to put people off, or to make it seem
that you are incapable of commitment. Uke the Virgin Queen, you need to
stir the pot, excite interest, lure people with the possibility of having you.
You have to bend to their attention occasionally, then-but never too far.
The Greek soldier and statesman Alcibiades played this game to per­
fection. It was Alcibiades who inspired and led the massive Athenian ar­
mada that invaded Sicily in 414 B.C. When envious Athenians back horne
tried to bring hirn down by accusing hirn of trumped-up charges, he de­
fected to the enemy, the Spartans, instead of facing a trial back horne. Then,
after the Athenians were defeated at Syracuse, he left Sparta for Persia, even
though the power of Sparta was now on the rise. Now, however, both the
Athenians and the Spartans courted Alcibiades because of his influence
with the Persians; and the Per lans showered hirn with honors because of
his power over the Athenians and the Spartans. He made promises to every
side but committed to none, and in the end he held all the cards.
If you aspire to power and influence, try the Alcibiades tactic: Put
yourself in the middle between competing powers. Lure one side with the
promise of your help; the other side, always wanting to outdo its enemy,
will pursue you as weIl. As each side vies for your attention, you will im­
mediately seem a person of great influence and desirability. More power
will accrue to you than if you had rashly committed to one side. To perfect
this tactic you need to keep yourself inwardly free from emotional entan­
glements, and to view all those around you as pawns in your rise to the top.
You cannot let yourself become the lackey for any cause.
In the midst of the 1968 U.S. presidential election, Henry Kissinger
made a phone call to Richard Nixon's team. Kissinger had been allied with
Nelson RockefeIler, who had unsuccessfully sought the Republican nomina­
tion. Now Kissinger offered to supply the Nixon camp with valuable inside
information on the negotiations for peace in Vietnam that were then going
on in Paris. He had a man on the negotiating team keeping rum informed of
the latest developments. The Nixon team gladly accepted his offer.
At the same time, however, Kissinger also approached the Democratic
nominee, Hubert Humphrey, and offered his aid. The Humphrey people
148 LAW 20

[PAGE 173]
asked hirn for inside information on Nixon and he supplied it. "Look,"
Kissinger told Humphrey's people, "I've hated Nixon for years." In fact he
had no interest in either side. What he really wanted was what he got: the
promise of a high-level cabinet post from both Nixon and Humphrey.
Whichever man won the election, Kissinger's career was secure.
The winner, of course, was Nixon, and Kissinger duly went on to his
cabinet post. Even so, he was careful never to appear too much of a Nixon
man. When Nixon was reelected in 1972, men much more loyal to hirn
than Kissinger were fired. Kissinger was also the only Nixon high official to
survive Watergate and serve under the next president, Gerald Ford. By
maintaining a little distance he thrived in turbulent times.
Those who use this strategy often notice a strange phenomenon:
People who rush to the support of others tend to gain little respect in the
process, for their help is so easily obtained, while those who stand back
find themselves besieged with supplicants. Their aloofness is powerful, and
everyone wants them on their side.
When Picasso, after early years of poverty, had become the most suc­
cessful artist in the world, he did not commit hirnself to this dealer or that
dealer, although they now besieged hirn from all sides with attractive offers
and grand promises. Instead, he appeared to have no interest in their ser­
vices; this technique drove them wild, and as they fought over hirn his
prices only rose. When Henry Kissinger, as U.S. secretary of state, wanted
to rea ch dHente with the Soviet Union, he made no concessions or concil­
iatory gestures, but courted China instead. This infuriated and also scared
the Soviets-they were already politica 11y isolated and feared further isola­
tion if the United States and China_came together. Kissinger's move
pushed them to the negotiating table. The tactic has a parallel in seduction:
When you want to seduce a woman, Stendhal advises, court her sister first.
Stay aloof and people will come to you. It will become achalienge for
them to win your affections. As long as you imitate the wise Virgin Queen
and stimulate their hopes, you will remain a magnet of attention and desire.

dangled in front of hirn the possibility of a marriage between her family
and his. Somehow it all worked, for although elsewhere he seized every­
thing in his path, he spared Mantua.
In 1503 Cesare's father, Alexander, died, and a few years later the new
pope, Julius 11, went to war to drive the French troops from Italy. When
the mler of Ferrara-Alfonso, Isabella's brother-sided with the French,
Julius decided to attack and humble hirn. Once again Isabella found herself
in the middle: the pope on one side, the French and her brother on the
other. She dared not ally herself with either, but to offe nd either would be
equally disastrous. Again she played the double game at which she had be­
come so expert. On the one hand she got her husband Gonzaga to fight for
the pope, knowing he would not fight very hard. On the other she let
French troops pass through Mantua to come to Ferrara's aid. While she
publidy complained that the French had "invaded" her territory, she pri­
vately supplied them with valuable information. To make the invasion
plausible to Julius, she even had the French pretend to plunder Mantua. It
worked once again: The pope left Mantua alone.
In 1513, after a lengthy siege, Julius defeated Ferrara, and the French
troops withdrew. Worn out by the effort, the pope died a few months later.
With his death, the nightrnarish cyde of battles and petty squabbles began
to repeat itself.

president, Washington avoided the temptation of making an alliance with
France or England, despite the pressUfe on hirn to do so. He wanted the
country to eam the world's respect through its independence. Although a
treaty with France mighthave helped in the short term, in the long run he
knew it would be more effective to establish the nation's autonomy. Eu­

SClIOPENIIAlIER,
17XS-ltiIJO First, however, they had to get rid of Amold and Slack. That meant hiding
their excitement-they certainly did not want to reveal the field's real
value. So they played possum. Who knows if Janin is right, they told the
prospectors, the mine may not be as rich as we think. This just made the
prospectors angry. Trying a different tactic, the financiers told the two men
that if they insisted on having shares in the mine, they would end up being
fleeced by the unscrupulous tycoons and investors who would run the cor­
poration; better, they said, to take the $700,000 already offered-an enor­
mous sum at the time-and put their greed aside. This the prospectors
seemed to understand, and they finally agreed to take the money, in return
signing the rights to the site over to the financiers, and leaving maps to it.
News of the mine spread like wildfire. Prospectors farmed out across
Wyoming. Meanwhile Harpending and group began spending the millions
they had collected from their investors, buying equipment, hiring the best
men in the business, and fumishing luxurious offices in New York and San
Francisco.
A few weeks later, on their first trip back to the site, they learned the
hard truth: Not a single diamond or ruby was to be found. It was all a fake.
They were ruined. Harpending had unwittingly lured the richest men in
the world into the biggest scam of the century.
Interpretation
Amold and Slack pulled off their stupendous con not by using a fake engi­
neer or bribing Tiffany: All of the experts had been real. All of them hon­
estly believed in the existence of the mine and in the value of the gems.
What had fooled them all was nothing else than Amold and Slack them­
selves. The two men seemed to be such rubes, such hayseeds, so naive, that
no one for an instant had believed them capable of an audacious scam.
The prospectors had simply observed the law of appearing more stupid
than the mark-the deceiver's First Commandment.
158 LAW 21

[PAGE 183]
The logistics of the con were quite simple. Months before Amold and
Slack announced the "discovery" of the diamond mine, they traveled to
Europe, where they purchased some real gems for around $12,000 (part of
the money they had saved from their days as gold miners). They then
salted the "mine" with these gems, which the first expert dug up and
brought to San Francisco. The jewelers who had appraised these stones, in­
cluding Tiffany hirnself, had gotten caught up in the fever and had grossly
overestimated their value. Then Ralston gave the prospectors $100,000 as
security, and immediately after their trip to New York they simply went to
Amsterdam, where they bought sacks of uncut gems, before retuming to
San Francisco. The second time they salted the mine, there were many
more jewels to be found.
The effectiveness of the scherne, however, rested not on tricks like
these but on the fact that Amold and Slack played their parts to perfection.
On their trip to New York, where they mingled with rnillionaires and ty­
coons, they played up their clodhopper image, wearing pants and coats a
size or two too small and acting incredulous at everything they saw in the
big city. No one believed that these country simpletons could possibly be
conning the most devious, unscrupulous financiers of the time. And once
Harpending, Ralston, and even Rothschild accepted the mine's existence,
anyone who doubted it was questioning the intelligence of the world's most
successful businessmen.
In the end, Harpending's reputation was ruined and he never recov­
ered; Rothschild leamed bis lesson and never fell for another con; Slack
took his money and disappeared from view, never to be found. Amold
simply went horne to Kentucky. After all, his sale of his mining rights had
been legitimate; the buyers had taken the best advice, and if the mine had
run out of diamonds, that was their problem. Amold used the money to
greatly enlarge his farm and open up a bank of his OWll.
KEYS TO POWER
The feeling that someone else is more intelligent than we are is almost in­
tolerable. We usually try to justify it in different ways: "He only has book
knowledge, whereas I have real knowledge." "Her parents paid for her to
get a good education. If my parents had had as much money, if I had been
as privileged . . . ." "He's not as smart as he thinks." Last but not least: "She
may know her narrow little field better than I do, but beyond that she's re­
ally not smart at all. Even Einstein was a boob outside physics."
Given how important the idea of intelligence is to most people's van­
ity, it is critical never inadvertently to insult or impugn a person's brain
power. That is an unforgivable sin. But if you can make this iron rule work
for you, it opens up all sorts of avenues of deception. Subliminally reassure
people that they are more intelligent than you are, or even that you are a
bit of amoron, and you can run rings around them. The feeling of intellec­
tual superiority you give them will disarm their suspicion-muscles.
In 1865 the Prussian councillor Otto von Bismarck wanted Austria to
LAW 21 159

[PAGE 184]
sign a certain treaty. The treaty was totally in the interests of Prussia and
against the interests of Austria, and Bismarck would have to strategize to
get the Austrians to agree to it. But the Austrian negotiator, Count BIome,
was an avid cardplayer. His particular game was quinze, and he often said
that he could judge a man's character by the way he played quinze. Bis­
marck knew of this saying of BIome's.
The night before the negotiations were to begin, Bismarck innocently
engaged BIome in agame of quinze. The Prussian would later write, "That
was the very last time l ever played quinze. I played so recklessly that
everyone was astonished. I lost several thousand talers [the currency of the
time], but I succeeded in fooling [BIome], for he believed me to be more
venturesome than l am and I gave way." Besides appearing reckless, Bis­
marck also played the witless fool, saying ridiculous things and bumbling
about with a surplus of nervous energy.
All this made BIome feel he had gathered valuable information. He
knew that Bismarck was aggressive--the Prussian already had that reputa­
tion, and the way he played had confirmed it. And aggressive men, BIome
knew, can be foolish '.md rash. Accordingly, when the time came to sign
the treaty, BIome thought he had the advantage. A heedless fool like Bis­
marck, he thought, is incapable of cold-blooded calculation and deception,
so he only glanced at the treaty before signing it-he failed to read the fine
print. As soon as the ink was dry, a joyous Bismarck exelaimed in his face,
"WeIl, I could never have believed that I should find an Austrian diplomat
willing to sign that document!"
The Chinese have a phrase, "Masquerading as a swine to kill the
tiger." This refers to an ancient hunting technique in which the hunter
elothes himself in the hide and snout of a pig, and mimics its grunting. The
mighty tiger thinks a pig is coming his way, and lets it get elose, savoring
the prospect of an easy meal. But it is the hunter who has the last laugh.
Masquerading as a swine works wonders on those who, like tigers, are
arrogant and overconfident: The easier they think it is to prey on you, the
more easily you can turn the tables. This trick is also useful if you are ambi­
tious yet find yourself low in the hierarchy: Appearing less intelligent than
you are, even a bit of a fool, is the perfect disguise. Look like a harmless pig
and no one will believe you harbor dangerous ambitions. They may even
promote you since you seem so likable, and subservient. Claudius before
he became emperor of Rome, and the prince of France who later became
Louis XIII, used this tactic when those above them suspected they might
have designs on the throne. By playing the fool as young men, they were
left alone. When the time came for them to strike, and to act with vigor and
decisiveness, they caught everyone off-guard.
Intelligence is the obvious quality to downplay, but why stop there?
Taste and sophistication rank elose to intelligence on the vanity scalej
make people feel they are more sophisticated than you are and their guard
will come down. As Arnold and Slack knew, an air of complete naivete can
work wonders. Those fancy financiers were laughing at them behind their
160 LAW 21

[PAGE 185]
backs, but who laughed loudest in the end? In general, then, always make
people believe they are smarter and more sophisticated than you are. They
will keep you around because you make them feel beUer about themselves,
and the longer you are around, the more opportunities you will have to de­
ceive them.

REVERSAL
To reveal the true nature of yoUf intelligence rarely pays; you should get in
the habit of downplaying it at all times. If people inadvertently leam the
truth-that you are actually much smarter than you look-they will admire
you more for being discreet than for making YOUf brilliance show. At the
start of your dimb to the top, of course, you cannot play too stupid: You
may want to let YOUf bosses know, in a subtle way, that you are smarter
than the competition around you. As you dimb the ladder, however, you
should to some degree try to dampen YOUf brilliance.
There is, however, one situation where it pays to do the opposite-­
when you can cover up a deception with a show of intelligence. In matters
of smarts as in most things, appearances are what count. If you seem to
have authority and knowledge, people will believe what you say. This can
be very useful in getting you out of a scrape.

a high price. Among the guests was a young French art critic who seemed
extremely knowledgeable and confident. Wanting to impress this man, the
tycoon's daughter showed him the Dürer, which had not yet been hung.
The critic studied it for a time, then finally said, "You know, I don't think
this Dürer is right." He followed the young woman as she hurried to tell
her father what he had said, and listened as the magnate, deeply unsettled,
tumed to Duveen for reassurance. Duveen just laughed. "How very amus­
ing," he said. "Do you realize, young man, that at least twenty other art ex­
perts here and in Europe have been taken in too, and have said that
painting isn't genuine? And now you've made the same mistake." His con­
fident tone and air of authority intimidated the Frenchman, who apolo­
gized for his mistake.
Duveen knew that the art market was flooded with fakes, and that .
many paintings had been falsely ascribed to old masters. He tried his best
to distinguish the real from the fake, but in his zeal to seIl he often over­
played a work's authenticity. What mattered to him was that the buyer be­
lieved he had bought a Dürer, and that Duveen himself convinced
everyone of his "expertness" through his air of irreproachable authority.
Thus, it is important to be able to play the professor when necessary and
never impose such an attitude for its own sake.

his beliefs, as well as fellow German intellectuals who had fled Hitler. In 1985
1941, accordingly, Brecht emigrated to the United States, and chose to set­
tle in Los Angeles, where he hoped to make a living in the film business.
Over the next few years Brecht wrote screenplays with a pointedly an­
ticapitalist slant. He had little success in Hollywood, so in 1947, the war
having ended, he decided to return to Europe. That same year, however,
the U.S. Congress's House Un-American Activities Committee began its
investigation into supposed Communist infiltration in Hollywood. It began
to gatber information on Brecht, who had so openly espoused Marxism,
and on September 19, 1947, only a month before he had planned to leave
the United States, he received a subpoena to appear before the committee.
In addition to Brecht, a number of other writers, producers, and directors
were summoned to appear as well, and this group came to be known as the
Hollywood 19.
Before going to Washington, the Hollywood 19 met to decide on a plan
of action. Their approach would be confrontational. Instead of answering
questions about their membership, or lack of it, in the Communist Party,
they would read prepared statements that would challenge the authority of
the committee and argue that its activities were unconstitutional. Even if
this strategy meant imprisonment, it would gain publicity for their cause.
Brecht disagreed. What good was it, he asked, to play the martyr and
gain a little public sympathy if in the process they lost the ability to stage
their plays and sell their scripts for years to come? He feIt certain they were
LAW 22 165

[PAGE 190]
all more intelligent than the members of the committee. Why lower them­
selves to the level of their opponents by arguing with them? Why not out­
fox the committee by appearing to surrender to it wbile subtly mocking it?
The Hollywood 19 listened to Brecht politely, but decided to stick to their
plan, leaving Brecht to go bis own way.
The committee finally summoned Brecht on October 30. They ex­
pected hirn to do what others among the Hollywood 19 who had testified
before hirn had done: Argue, refuse to answer questions, challenge the
committee's right to hold its hearing, even yell and hurI insults. Much to
their surprise, however, Brecht was the very picture of congeniality. He
wore a suit (something he rarely did), smoked a cigar (he had heard that
the committee chairman was a passionate cigar smoker), answered their
questions politely, and generally deferred to their authority.
Unlike the other witnesses, Brecht answered the question of whether
he belonged to the Communist Party: He was not a member, he said,
which happened to be the truth. One committee member asked hirn, "Is it
true you have written a number of revolutionary plays?" Brecht had writ­
ten many plays with overt Communist messages, but he responded, "I
have written a number of poems and songs and plays in the fight against
Hitler and, of course, they can be considered, therefore, as revolutionary
because I, of course, was for the overthrow of that government." This state­
ment went unchallenged.
Brecht's English was more than adequate, but he used an interpreter
throughout his testimony, a tactic that allowed hirn to play subtle games
with language. When committee members found Communist leanings in
lines from English editions of his poems, he would repeat the lines in Ger­
man for the interpreter, who would then retranslate them; and somehow
they would c;ome out innocuous. At one point a committee member read
one of Brecht's revolutionary poems out loud in English, and asked hirn if
he had written it. "No," he responded, "I wrote a German poem, wbich is
very different from this." The author's elusive answers baffled the commit­
tee members, but his politeness and the way he yielded to their authority
made it impossible for them to get angry with hirn.
After only an hour of questioning, the committee members had had
enough. "Thank you very much," said the chairman, "You are a good ex­
ample to the [other] witnesses." Not only did they free hirn, they offered to
help hirn if he had any trouble with immigration officials who might detain
hirn for their own reasons. The following day, Brecht left the United States,
never to return.
Interpretation
The Hollywood 19's confrontational approach won them a lot of sympa­
thy, and years later they gained a kind of vindication in public opinion. But
they were also blacklisted, and lost valuable years of profitable working
time. Brecht, on the other hand, expressed his disgust at the committee
more indirectly. It was not that he changed his beliefs or compromised his
values; instead, during his short testimony, he kept the upper hand by ap-
166 LAW 22

[PAGE 191]
pearing to yield while all the time running cireles around the committee
with vague responses, outright lies that went unchallenged because they
were wrapped in enigmas, and word games. In the end he kept the free­
dom to continue his revolutionary writing (as opposed to suffering impris­
onment or detainment in the United States), even while subtly mocking the
committee and its authority with his pseudo-obedience.
Keep in mind the following: People trying to make a show of their au­
thority are easily deceived by the surrender tactic. Your outward sign of
submission makes them feel important; satisfied that you respect them,
they become easier targets for a later counterattack, or for the kind of indi­
rect ridicule used by Brecht. Measuring your power over time, never sacri­
fice long-term maneuverability for the short-lived glories of martyrdom.
When the great lord passes, the wise peasant bows deeply and silently Jarts.
Ethiopian proverb
KEYS TO POWER
What gets us into trouble in the realm of power is often our own overreac­
tion to the moves of our enemies and rivals. That overreaction creates
problems we would have avoided had we been more reasonable. It also
has an endless rebound effect, for the enemy then overreacts as well, much
as the Athenians did to the Melians. It is always our first instinct to react, to
meet aggression with some other kind of aggression. But the next time
someone pushes you and you find yourself starting to react, try this: Do not
resist or fight back, but yield, turn the other cheek, bend. You will find that
this often neutralizes their behavior-they expected, even wanted you to
react with force and so they are caught off-guard and confounded by your
lack of resistance. By yielding, you in fact control the situation, because
your surrender is part of a larger plan to lull them into believing they have
defeated you.
This is the essence of the surrender tactic: Inwardly you stay firm, but
outwardly you bend. Deprived of a reason to get angry, your opponents
will often be bewildered instead. And they are unlikely to react with more
violence, which would demand a reaction from you. Instead you are al­
lowed the time and space to plot the countermoves that will bring them
down. In the battle of the intelligent against the brutal and the aggressive,
the surrender tactic is the supreme weapon. It does require self-control:
Those who genuinely surrender give up their freedom, and may be
crushed by the humiliation of their defeat. You have to remember that you
only appear to surrender, like the animal that plays dead to save its hide.
We have seen that it can be better to surrender than to fight; faced with
a more powerful opponent and a sure defeat, it is often also better to sur­
render than to run away. Running away may save you for the time being,
but the aggressor will eventually catch up with you. If you surrender in­
stead, you have an opportunity to coil around your enemy and strike with
your fangs from elose up.
LAW 22 167

[PAGE 192]
In 473 B.C., in ancient China, King Goujian ofYue suffered a horrible
defeat from the mler of Wu in the battle of Fujiao. Goujian wanted to flee,
but he had an adviser who told hirn to surrender and to place hirnself in the
service of the mler of Wu, from which position he could study the man and
plot his revenge. Deciding to follow this advice, Goujian gave the mler all
of his riches, and went to work in his conqueror's stables as the lowest ser­
vant. For three years he humbled himselfbefore the mler, who then, finally
satisfied of his loyalty, allowed hirn to return horne. Inwardly, however,
Goujian had spent those three years gathering information and plotting re­
venge. When a terrible drought struck Wu, and the kingdom was weak­
ened by inner turmoil, he raised an army, invaded, and won with ease.
That is the power behind surrender: It gives you the time and the flexibility
to plot a devastating counterblow. Had Goujian mn away, he would have
lost this chance.
When foreign trade began to threaten Japanese independence in the
mid-nineteenth century, the Japanese debated how to defeat the foreign­
ers. One minister, Hotta Masayoshi, wrote a memorandum in 1857 that in­
fluencedJapanese policy for years to come: "I am therefore convinced that
our policy should be to condude friendly alliances, to send ships to foreign
countries everywhere and conduct trade, to copy the foreigners where they
are at their best and so repair our own shortcomings, to foster our national
strength and complete our armaments, and so gradually subject the foreign­
ers to our influence until in the end all the countries of the world know the
blessings of perfect tranquillity and our hegemony is acknowledged
throughout the globe." This is a brilliant application of the Law: Use sur­
render to gain access to your enemy. Learn his ways, insinuate yourself
with hirn slowly, outwardly conform to his customs, but inwardly maintain
your own culture. Eventually you will emerge victorious, for while he con­
siders you weak and inferior, and takes no precautions against you, you are
using the time to catch up and surpass him. This soft, permeable form of in­
vasion is often the best, for the enemy has nothing to react against, prepare
for, or resist. And had Japan resisted Western influence by force, it might
well have suffered a devastating invasion that would have permanently al­
tered its culture.
Surrender can also offer a way of mocking your enemies, of turning
their power against them, as it did for Brecht. Milan Kundera's novel The
Joke, based on the author's experiences in a penal camp in Czechoslovakia,
tells the story of how the prison guards organized a relay race, guards
against prisoners. For the guards this was a chance to show off their physi­
cal superiority. The prisoners knew they were expected to lose, so they
went out of their way to oblige-miming exaggerated exertion while
barely moving, mnning a few yards and collapsing, limping, jogging ever
so slowly while the guards raced ahead at full speed. Both by joining the
race and by losing it, they had obliged the guards obediently; but their
"overobedience" had mocked the event to the point of mining it. Overobe­
dience-surrender-was here a way to demonstrate superiority in a re­
verse manner. Resistance would have engaged the prisoners in the cyde of
168 LAW 22

[PAGE 193]
violence, lowering them to the guards' level. Overobeying the guards, how­
ever, made them ridiculous, yet they could not rightly punish the prison­
ers, who had only done what they asked.
Power is always in flux-since the game is by nature fluid, and an arena
of constant struggle, those with power almost always find themselves even­
tually on the downward swing. If you find yourself temporarily weakened,
the surrender tactic is perfect for raising yourself up again-it disguises your
ambition; it teaches you patience and self-control, key skills in the game;
and it puts you in the best possible position for taking advantage ofyour op­
pressor's sudden slide. If you run away or fight back, in the long run you
cannot win. If you surrender, you will almost always emerge victorious.

[PAGE 194]
REVERSAL
The point of surrendering is to save your hide for a later date when you
can reassert yourself. It is precisely to avoid martyrdom that one surren­
ders, but there are times when the enemy will not relent, and martyrdom
seems the only way out. Furthermore, if you are willing to die, others may
gain power and inspiration from your example.
Yet martyrdom, surrender's reversal, is a messy, inexact tactic, and is
as violent as the aggression it combats. For every famous martyr there are
thousands more who have inspired neither a religion nor a rebellion, so
that if martyrdom does sometimes grant a certain power, it does so unpre­
dictably. More important, you will not be around to enjoy that power, such
as it iso And there is finally something selfish and arrogant about martyrs,
as if they feit their followers were less important than their own glory.
When power deserts you, it is best to ignore this Law's reversal. Leave
martyrdom alone: The pendulum will swing back your way eventually,
and you should stay alive to see it.

matches among their cbildren, sixteen of these being contracted between
first cousins.
"We are like the mechanism of a watch: Each part is essential," said
brother Salomon. As in a watch, every part of the business moved in con­
cert with every other, and the inner workings were invisible to the world,
which only saw the movement of the hands. While other rich and powerful
families suffered irrecoverable downturns during the tumultous first half of
the nineteenth century, the tight-knit Rothschilds managed not only to pre­
serve but to expand their unprecedented wealth.
Interpretation
The Rothschilds were born in strange times. They came from a place that
had not changed in centuries, but lived in an age that gave birth to the In­
dustrial Revolution, the French Revolution, and an endless series of up­
heavals. The Rothchilds kept the past alive, resisted the patterns of
dispersion of their era and for this are emblematic of the law of concentra­
tion.
No one represents this better than James Rothschild, the son who es­
tablished himself in Paris. In bis lifetime J ames witnessed the defeat of
Napoleon, the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy, the bourgeois monar­
chy of Orleans, the return to a republic, and finally the enthronement of
Napoleo \ IH. French styles and fashions changed at a relentless pace dur­
ing all trus turmoil. Without appearing to be a relic of the past, J ames
steered his family as if the ghetto lived on within them. He kept alive his
clan's inner cohesion and strength. Only through such an anchoring in the
past was the family able to thrive amidst such chaos. Concentration was the
foundation of the Rothschilds' power, wealth, and stability.
The best strategy is always to be very strong; first in general, then
at the decisive point . . . . There is no higher and simpler law of strategy
than that of keeping one's forces concentrated . . . .I n short the
first principle is: act with the utmost concentration.
On War, Carl von Clausewitz, 1780-1831
KEYS TO POWER
The world is plagued by greater and greater division-within countries,
political groups, families, even individuals. We are all in astate of total dis­
traction and diffusion, hardly able to keep our minds in one direction be­
fore we are pulled in a thousand others. The modem world's level of
conflict is higher than ever, and we have internalized it in our own lives.
The solution is a form of retreat inside ourselves, to the past, to more
concentrated forms of thought and action. As Schopenhauer wrote, "Intel­
lect is a magnitude of intensity, not a magnitude of extensity." Napoleon
knew the value of concentrating your forces at the enemy's weakest spot-
174 LAW 23

[PAGE 199]
it was the secret of his success on the battlefield. But his willpower and his
mind were equally modeled on this notion. Single-mindedness of purpose,
total concentration on the goal, and the use of these qualities against peo­
pIe less focused, people in astate of distraction-such an arrow will find its
mark every time and overwhelm the enemy.
Casanova attributed his success in life to his ability to concentrate on a
single goal and push at it until it yielded. It was his ability to give hirnself
over completely to the women he desired that made hirn so intensely se­
ductive. For the weeks or months that one of these women lived in his
orbit, he thought of no one else. When he was imprisoned in the treacher­
ous "leads" of the doge's palace in Venice, a prison from which no one had
ever escaped, he concentrated his mind on the single goal of escape, day
after day. A change of cells, which meant that months of digging had all
been for naught, did not discourage hirn; he persisted and eventually es­
caped. "I have always believed," he later wrote, "that when a man gets it
into his head to do something, and when he exclusively occupies hirnself in
that design, he must succeed, whatever the difficulties. That man will be­
come Grand Vizier or Pope."
Concentrate (, la single goal, a single task, and beat it into submission.
In the world of power you will constantIy need help from other people,
usually those more powerful than you. The fool flits from one person to an­
other, believing that he will survive by spreading hirnself out. It is a corol­
lary of the law of concentration, however, that much energy is saved, and
more power is attained, by affixing yourself to a single, appropriate source
of power. The scientist Nikola Tesla ruined hirnself by believing that he
somehow maintained his independence by not having to serve a single
master. He even turned down J. P. Morgan, who offered hirn a rich con­
tract. In the end, Tesla's "independence" meant that he could depend on
no single patron, but was always having to toady up to a dozen of them.
Later in his life he realized his mistake.
All the great Renaissance painters and writers wrestIed with this prob­
lem, none more so than the sixteenth-century writer Pietro Aretino.
Throughout his life Aretino suffered the indignities of having to pIe ase this
prince and that. At last, he had had enough, and decided to woo Charles
V, promising the emperor the services of his powerful pen. He finally dis­
covered the freedom that came from attachment to a single source of
power. Michelangelo found this freedom with Pope Julius H, Galileo with
the Medicis. In the end, the single patron appreciates your loyalty and be­
comes dependent on your services; in the long run the master serves the
slave.
Finally, power itself always exists in concentrated forms. In any orga­
nization it is inevitable for a small group to hold the strings. And often it is
not those with the titIes. In the game of power, only the fool flails about
without fixing his target. You must find out who controls the operations,
who is the real director behind the scenes. As Richelieu discovered at the
beginning of his rise to the top of the French political scene during the
LAW 23 175

[PAGE 200]
early seventeenth century, it was not King Louis XIII who decided things,
it was the king's mother. And so he attached hirnself to her, and catapulted
through the ranks of the courtiers, all the way to the top.
It is enough to strike oil once-your wealth and power are assured for
a lifetime.
Image: The Arrow. You cannot hit two targets
with one arrow. If your thoughts stray, you
miss the enemy's heart. Mind and
arrow must become one. Only
with such concentration of
mental and physical
power can your arrow
hit the target and
pierce the
heart.
Authority: Prize intensity more than extensity. Perfection re­
sides in quality, not quantity. Extent alone never rises above
mediocrity, and it is the misfortune of men with wide general
interests that while they would like to have their finger in every
pie, they have one in none. Intensity gives eminen ce, and rises
to the heroic in matters sublime. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658)
REVERSAL
There are dangers in concentration, and moments when dispersion is the
proper tactical move. Fighting the Nationalists for control of China, Mao
Tse-tung and the Communists fought a protracted war on several fronts,
using sabotage and ambush as their main weapons. Dispersal is often suit­
able for the weaker side; it is, in fact, a crucial principle of guerrilla warfare.
When fighting a stronger army, concentrating YOUf forces only makes you
an easier target-better to dissolve into the scenery and frustrate your
enemy with the elusiveness of YOUf presence.
Tying YOUfself to a single SOUfce of power has one preeminent danger:
If that person dies, leaves, or falls from grace, you suffe r. This is what hap­
pened to Cesare Borgia, who derived his power from his father, Pope
Alexander VI. It was the pope who gave Cesare armies to fight with and
wars to wage in his name. When he suddenly died (perhaps from poison),
176 LAW 23

[PAGE 201]
Cesare was as good as dead. He had made far too many enemies over the
years, and was now without his father's protection. In cases when you may
need protection, then, it is often wise to entwine YOUfseif around several
sources of power. Such a move would be especially prudent in periods of
great tumult and violent change, or when YOUf enemies are numerous. The
more patrons and masters you serve the less risk you run if one of them
falls from power. Such dispersion will even allow you to play one off
against the other. Even if you concentrate on the single SOUfce of power,
you still must practice caution, and I cepare for the day when YOUf master
or patron is no longer there to help you.
Finally, being too single-minded in purpose can make you an intolera­
ble bore, especially in the arts. The Renaissance painter Paolo Uccello was
so obsessed with perspective that his paintings look lifeless and contrived.
Whereas Leonardo da Vinci interested himself in everything-architec­
ture, painting, warfare, sculpture, mechanics. Diffusion was the source of
his power. But such genius is rare, and the rest of us are better off erring on
the side of intensity.

Never Afef ct Friendliness and Intirnacy with Your Master. He does
not want a friend for a subordinate, he wants a subo rdinate. Never ap­
proach hirn in an easy, friendly way, or act as if you are on the best of
terrns-that is his prerogative. If he chooses to deal with you on this level,
assume a wary chumminess. Otherwise err in the opposite direction, and
make the distance between you clear.
Never Criticize Those Above You Directly. This may seem obvious,
but there are often times when some sort of criticism is necessary-to say
nothing, or to give no advice, would open you to risks of another sort. You
must leam, however, to couch YOUf advice and criticism as indirectly and as
politely as possible. Think twice, or three times, before deciding you have
made them sufficiently circuitous. Err on the side of subtlety and gentleness.
Be Frugal in Asking Those Above You for Favors. Nothing irritates a
master more than having to reject someone's request. It stirs up guilt and
resentment. Ask for favors as rarely as possible, and know when to stop.
Rather than making YOUfself the supplicant, it is always better to eam YOUf
favors, so that the ruler bestows them willingly. Most important: Do not ask
for favors on another person's behalf, least of all a friend's.
Never Joke About Appearances or Taste. A lively wit and a humorous
disposition are essential qualities for a good courtier, and there are times
when vulgarity is appropriate and engaging. But avoid any kind of joke
about appearance or taste, two highly sensitive areas, especially with those
above you. Do not even try it when you are away from them. You will dig
YOUf OWD grave.
Do Not Be the Court Cynic. Express admiration for the good work of
others. If you constantly criticize YOUf equals or subordinates some of that
criticism will rub off on you, hovering over you like a gray cloud wherever
you go. People will groan at each new cynical comment, and you will irri­
tate them. By expressing modest admiration for other people's achieve­
ments, you paradoxically call attention to your OWD. The ability to express
wonder and amazement, and seem like you mean it, is a rare and dying tal­
ent, but one still greatly valued.
Be Self-observant. The mirror is a miraculous invention; without it you
would commit great sins against beauty and decorum. You also need a mir­
ror for your actions. This can sometimes come from other people telling
you what they see in you, but that is not the most trustworthy method: You
must be the mirror, training your mind to try to see YOUfself as others see
you. Are you acting too obsequious? Are you trying too hard to please? Do
you seem desperate for attention, giving the impression that you are on the
decline? Be observant about YOUfself and you will avoid a mountain of
blunders.
LAW 24 181

Master Your Emotions. As an actor in a great play, you must leam to cry
and laugh on command and when it is appropriate. You must be able both
to disguise your anger and frustration and to fake your contentment and
agreement. You must be the master of your own face. Call it lying if you
like; but if you prefer to not play the game and to always be honest and up­
front, do not complain when others call you obnoxious and arrogant.
Fit the Spirit of the Times. A slight affeetation of a past era can be
charming, as long as you choose aperiod at least twenty years back; wear­
ing the fashions of ten years ago is ludicrous, unless you enjoy the role of
court jester. Your spirit and way of thinking must keep up with the times,
even if the times offend your sensibilities. Be too forward-thinking, how­
ever, and no one will understand you. It is never a good idea to stand out
too much in this area; you are best off at least being able to mimic the spirit
of the times.
Be a Source of Pleasure. This is critical. It is an obvious law of human
nature that we will flee what is unpleasant and distasteful, while charm and
the promise of delight will draw us like moths to a flame. Make yourself the
flame and you will rise to the top. Since life is otherwise so full of unpleas­
antness and pleasure so scarce, you will be as indispensable as food and
drink. This may seem obvious, but what is obvious is often ignored or un­
appreciated. There are degrees to this: Not everyone can play the role of
favorite, for not everyone is blessed with charm and wit. But we can all
control our unpleasant qualities and obscure them when necessary.
A man who knows the court is master of his gestures, of his eyes and
of his face; he is profound, impenetrable; he dissimulates bad offices,
smiles at his enemies, controls his irritation, disguises his passions,
belies his heart, speaks and acts against his feelings.

SCENES OF COURT LIFE: Exemplary Deeds and Fatal Mistakes
Scene I
Alexander the Great, conqueror of the Mediterranean basin and the Mid­
dIe East through to India, had had the great Aristotle as his tutor and men­
tor, and throughout his short life he remained devoted to philosophy and
his master's teachings. He once complained to Aristotle that during his
long campaigns he had no one with whom he could discuss philosophical
matters. Aristotle responded by suggesting that he take Callisthenes, a for­
mer pupil of Aristotle's and a promising philosopher in his own right,
along on the next campaign.
Aristotle had schooled Callisthenes in the skills ofbeing a courtier, but
182 LAW 24

[PAGE 207]
the young man secretly scoffed at them. He believed in pure philosophy, in
unadorned words, in speaking the naked truth. If Alexander loved learning
so much, Callisthenes thought, he could not object to one who spoke his
mind. During one of Alexander's major campaigns, Callisthenes spoke his
mind one too many times and Alexander had him put to death.
Interpretation
In court, honesty is a fool's game. Never be so self-absorbed as to believe
that the master is interested in your criticisms of hirn, no matter how accu­
rate they are.
Scene II
Beginning in the Han Dynasty two thousand years ago, Chinese scholars
compiled aseries ofwritings called the 27 Histories, an official biography of
each dynasty, including stories, statistics, census figures, and war chroni­
des. Each history also contained a chapter called "Unusual Events," and
here, among the listings of earthquakes and floods, there would sometimes
suddenly appear descriptions of such bizarre manifestations as two-headed
sheep, geese flying backward, stars suddenly appearing in different parts of
the sky, and so on. The earthquakes could be historically verified, but the
monsters and weird natural phenomena were clearly inserted on purpose,
and invariably occurred in clusters. What could this mean?
The Chinese emperor was considered more than a man-he was a
force of nature. His kingdom was the center of the universe, and every­
thing revolved around hirn. He embodied the world's perfection. To criti­
cize hirn or any of his actions would have been to criticize the divine order.
No minister or courtier dared approach the emperor with even the slightest
cautionary word. But emperors were fallible and the kingdom suffered
greatly by their mistakes. Inserting sightings of strange phenomena into the
court chronicles was the only way to warn them. The emperor would read
of geese flying backward and moons out of orbit, and realize that he was
being cautioned. His actions were unbalancing the universe and needed to
change.
Interpretation
For Chinese courtiers, the problem of how to give the emperor advice was
an important issue. Over the years, thousands of them had died trying to
warn or counsel their master. To be made safely, their criticisms had to be
indirect-yet if they were too indirect they would not be heeded. The
chronicles were their solution: Identify no one person as the source of criti­
cism, make the advice as impersonal as possible, but let the emperor know
the gravity of the situation.
Your master is no longer the center of the universe, but he still imag­
ines that everything revolves around hirn. When you criticize hirn he sees
the person criticizing, not the criticism itself. Like the Chinese courtiers,
you must find a way to disappear behind the warning. Use symbols and
other indirect methods to paint a picture of the problems to come, without
putting your neck on the line.
LAW 24 183

[PAGE 208]
Scene III
Early in his career, the French architect Jules Mansart received commis­
sions to design minor additions to Versailles for King Louis XIV. For each
design he would draw up his plans, making sure they followed Louis's in­
structions closely. He would then present them to His Majesty.
The courtier Saint-Simon described Mansart's technique in dealing
with the king: "His particular skill was to show the king plans that pur­
posely included something imperfect about them, often dealing with the
gardens, which were not Mansart's specialty. The king, as Mansart ex­
pected, would put his finger exactly on the problem and propose how to
solve it, at which point Mansart would exclaim for all to hear that he would
never have seen the problem that the king had so masterfully found and
solved; he would burst with admiration, confessing that next to the king he
was but a lowly pupil." At the age of thirty, having used these methods
time and time again, Mansart received a prestigious royal commission: Al­
though he was less talented and experienced than a number of other
French designers, he was to take charge of the enlargement of Versailles.
He was the king's architect from then on.
Interpretation
As a young man, Mansart had seen how many royal craftsmen in the ser­
vice of Louis XIV had lost their positions not through a lack of talent but
through a costly social blunder. He would not make that mistake. Mansart
always strove to make Louis feel better about hirnself, to feed the king's
vanity as publicly as possible.
Never imagine that skill and talent are all that matter. In court the
courtier's art is more important than his talent; never spend so much time
on your studies that you neglect your social skills. And the greatest skill of
all is the ability to make the master look more talented than those around
hirn.
Scene IV
Jean-Baptiste Isabey had become the unofficial painter of the Napoleonic
court. During the Congress of Vienna in 1814, after Napoleon, defeated,
had been imprisoned on the island of Elba, the participants in these meet­
ings, which were to decide the fate of Europe, invited Isabey to immortal­
ize the historie events in an epic painting.
When Isabey arrived in Vienna, Talleyrand, the main negotiator for
the French, paid the artist a visit. Considering his role in the proceedings,
the statesman explained, he expected to occupy center stage in the paint­
ing. Isabey cordially agreed. A few days later the Duke of Wellington, the
main negotiator for the English, also approached Isabey, and said much
the same thing that Talleyrand had. The ever polite Isabey agreed that the
great duke should indeed be the center of attention.
Back in his studio, Isabey pondered the dilemma. If he gave the spot­
light to either of the two men, he could create a diplomatie rift, stirring up
all sorts of resentrnent at a time when peace and concord were critical.
184 LAW 24

[PAGE 209]
When the painting was finally unveiled, however, both Talleyrand and
Wellington feIt honored and satisfied. The work depicts a large hall filled
with diplomats and politicians from all over Europe. On one side the Duke
of Wellington enters the room, and all eyes are turned toward him; he is
the "center" of attention. In the very center of the painting, meanwhile, sits
Talleyrand.
Interpretation
It is often very difficult to satisfy the master, but to satisfy two masters in
one stroke takes the genius of a great courtier. Such predicaments are com­
mon in the life of a courtier: By giving attention to one master, he dis­
pleases another. You must find a way to navigate this Scylla and Charybdis
safely. Masters must receive their due; never inadvertently stir up the re­
sentment of one in pleasing another.
Scene V
George Brummell, also known as Beau Brummell, made his mark in the
late 1700s by the supreme elegance of his appearance, his popularization of
shoe buckles (soon imitated by all the dandies), and his clever way with
words. His London house was the fashionable spot in town, and Brummell
was the authority on all matters of fashion. If he disliked your footwear,
you immediately got rid of it and bought whatever he was wearing. He per­
feeted the art of tying a cravat; Lord Byron was said to spend many a night
in front of the mirror trying to figure out the secret behind Brummell's per­
feet knots.
One of Brummell's greatest admirers was the Prince of Wales, who
fancied himself a fashionable young man. Becoming attached to the
prince's court (and provided with a royal pension), Brummell was soon so
sure of his own authority there that he took to joking about the prince's
weight, referring to his host as Big Ben. Since trimness of figure was an im­
portant quality for a dandy, this was a withering criticism. At dinner once,
when the service was slow, Brummell said to the prince, "Do ring, Big
Ben." The prince rang, but when the valet arrived he ordered the man to
show Brummell the door and never admit him again.
Despite falling into the prince's disfavor, Brummell continued to treat
everyone around him with the same arrogance. Without the Prince of
Wales' patronage to support him, he sank into horrible debt, but he main­
tained his insolent manners, and everyone so on abandoned him. He died
in the most pitiable poverty, alone and deranged.
Interpretation
Beau Brummell's devastating wit was one of the qualities that endeared
him to the Prince ofWales. But not even he, the arbiter oftaste and fashion,
could get away with a joke about the prince's appearance, least of all to his
face. Never joke about a person's plumpness, even indirectly-and particu­
lady when he is your master. The poorhouses of history are filled with peo­
pIe who have made such jokes at their master's expense.

as his ambassador to the Vatican. One of Testi's letters to the duke reveals
why he was chosen: "Once our discussion was over, I kneeled to depart,
but His Holiness made a signal and walked to another room where he
sleeps, and after reaching a small table, he grabbed a bundle of papers and
thus, tuming to me with a smiling face, he said: 'We want Your Lordship to
listen to some of our compositions.' And, in fact, he read me two very long
Pindaric poems, one in praise of the most holy Virgin, and the other one
ab out Countess Matilde."
We do not know exactly what Testi thought of these very long poems,
since it would have been dangerous for hirn to state his opinion freely,
even in a letter. But he went on to write, "I, following the mood, com­
mented on each line with the needed praise, and, after having kissed His
Holiness's foot for such an unusual sign of benevolence [the reading of the
poetry], I left." Weeks later, when the duke hirnself visited the pope, he
managed to recite entire verses of the pope's poetry and praised it enough
to make the pope "so jubilant he seemed to lose his mind."
Interpretation
In matters of taste you can never be too obsequious with your master. Taste
is one of the ego's prickliest parts; never impugn or question the master's
taste-his poetry is sublime, his dress impeccable, and his manner the
model for all.
Scene VII
One aftemoon in ancient China, Chao, ruler of Han from 358 to 333 B.C.,
got drunk and fell asleep in the palace gardens. The court crown-keeper,
whose sole task was to look after the ruler's head apparel, passed through
the gardens and saw his master sleeping without a coat. Since it was getting
cold, the crown-keeper placed his own coat over the ruler, and left.
When Chao awoke and saw the coat upon hirn, he asked his atten­
dants, "Who put more clothes on my body?" "The crown-keeper," they
replied. The ruler immediately called for his official coat-keeper and had
hirn punished for neglecting his duties. He also called for the crown­
keeper, whom he had beheaded.
Interpretation
Do not overstep your bounds. Do what you are assigned to do, to the best
of your abilities, and never do more. To think that by doing more you are
doing better is a common blunder. It is never good to seem to be trying too
hard-it is as if you were covering up some deficiency. Fulfilling a task that
has not been asked of you just makes people suspicious. If you are a crown­
keeper, be a crown-keeper. Save your excess energy for when you are not
in the court.

Scene VIII
One day, for amusement, the Italian Renaissance painter Fra Filippo Lippi
(1406-1469) and some friends went sailing in a small boat off Ancona.
There they were captured by two Moorish galleys, which hauled them off
in chains to Barbary, where they were sold as slaves. For eighteen long
months Filippo toiled with no hope of returning to ltaly.
On several occasions Filippo saw the man who had bought hirn pass
by, and one day he decided to sketch this man's portrait, using burnt
coal-charcoal-from the fire. Still in his chains, he found a white wall,
where he drew a full-Iength likeness of his owner in Moorish clothing. The
owner so on heard about this, for no one had seen such skill in drawing be­
fore in these parts; it seemed like a miracle, a gift from God. The drawing
so pleased the owner that he instantly gave Filippo his freedom and em­
ployed hirn in his court. All the big men on the Barbary coast came to see
the magnificent color portraits that Fra Filippo then proceeded to do, and
finally, in gratitude for the honor in this way brought upon hirn, Filippo's
owner returned the artist safely to ltaly.
Interpretation
We who toil for other people have all in some way been captured by pi­
rates and sold into slavery. But like Fra Filippo (if to a lesser degree), most
of us possess some gift, same talent, an ability to do something better than
other people. Make your master a gift of YOUf talents and you will rise
above other courtiers. Let hirn take the credit if necessary, it will only be
temporary: Use hirn as a stepping stone, a way of displaying your talent
and eventually buying your freedom from enslavement.
Scene IX
Alfonso 1 of Aragon once had a servant who told the king that the night
before he had had a dream: Alfonso had given hirn a gift of weapons,
horses, and clothes. Alfonso, a generous, lordly man, decided it would be
amusing to make this dream come true, and promptly gave the servant
exaetly these gifts.
A little while later, the same servant announced to Alfonso that he had
had yet another dream, and in this one Alfonso had given hirn a consider­
able pile of gold florins. The king smiled and said, "Don't believe in
dreams from now on; they He."
Interpretation
In his treatment of the servant's first dream, Alfonso remained in control.
By making a dream come true, he claimed a godlike power for hirnself, if
in a mild and humorous way. In the second dream, however, all appear­
anee of magic was gone; this was not hing but an ugly con game on the ser­
vant's part. Never ask for too much, then, and know when to stop. It is the
master's prerogative to give-to give when he wants and what he wants,
and to do so without prompting. Do not give hirn the chance to reject your
requests. Better to win favors by deserving them, so that they are bestowed
without your asking.

Scene X
The great English landscape painter J. M. W. Turner (1775-1851) was
known for his use of color, which he applied with a brilliance and a strange
iridescence. The color in his paintings was so striking, in fact, that other
artists never wanted his work hung next to theirs: It inevitably made every­
thing around it seem dull.
The painter Sir Thomas Lawrence once had the misfortune of seeing
Turner's masterpiece Cologne hanging in an exhibition between two works
of his own. Lawrence complained bitterly to the gallery owner, who gave
hirn no satisfaction: After all, someone's paintings had to hang next to
Turner's. But Turner heard of Lawrence's complaint, and before the exhibi­
tion opened, he toned down the brilliant golden sky in Cologne, making it as
dull as the colors in Lawrence's works. A friend of Turner's who saw the
painting approached the artist with a horrified look: "What have you done
to your picture!" he said. "Well, poor Lawrence was so unhappy," Turner
replied, "and it's only larnpblack. It'll wash off after the exhibition."
Interpretation
Many of a courtier's anxieties have to do with the master, with whom most
dangers lie. Yet it is amistake to imagine that the master is the only one to
detennine your fate. Your equals and subordinates play integral parts also.
A court is a vast stew of resentments, fears, and powernd envy. You have to
placate everyone who might someday hann you, deflecting their resent­
ment and envy and diverting their hostility onto other people.
Turner, eminent courtier, knew that his good fortune and farne de­
pended on his fellow painters as well as on his dealers and patrons. How
many of the great have been felled by envious colleagues! Better temporar­
ily to dull your brilliance than to suffer the slings and arrows of envy.
Scene XI
Winston Churchill was an amateur artist, and after World War 11 his paint­
ings became collector's items. The American publisher Henry Luce, in
fact, creator of Time and Lift magazines, kept one of Churchill's landscapes
hanging in his private office in New York.
On a tour through the United States once, Churchill visited Luce in his
office, and the two men looked at the painting together. The publisher re­
marked, "It's a good picture, but I think it needs something in the fore­
ground-a sheep, perhaps." Much to Luce's horror, Churchill's secretary
called the publisher the next day and asked hirn to have the painting sent
to England. Luce did so, mortified that he had perhaps offended the former
prime minister. A few days later, however, the painting was shipped back,
but slightly altered: a single sheep now grazed peacefully in the fore­
ground.
Interpretation
In stature and farne, Churchill stood head and shoulders above Luce, but
Luce was certainly a man of power, so let us imagine a slight equality be­
tween them. Still, what did Churchill have to fear from an American pub­
lisher? Why bow to the criticism of a dilettante ?
188 LAW 24

[PAGE 213]
A court-in this case the entire world of diplomats and intemational
statesmen, and also of the joumalists who court them-is a place of mutual
dependence. It is unwise to insult or offend the taste of people of power,
even if they are below or equal to you. If a man like Churchill can swallow
the criticisms of a man like Luce, he proves hirns elf a courtier without peer.
(Perhaps his correction of the painting implied a certain condescension as
weIl, but he did it so subtly that Luce did not perceive any slight.) Imitate
Churchill: Put in the sheep. It is always beneficial to play the obliging
courtier, even when you are not serving a master.
TRE DELICATE GAME OF COURTIERSHIP: A Waming
Talleyrand was the consummate courtier, especially in serving his master
Napoleon. When the two men were first getting to know each other,
Napoleon once said in passing, "I shall come to lunch at your house one of
these days." Talleyrand had a house at Auteuil, in the suburbs of Paris. "I
should be delighted, mon general," the minister replied, "and since my
house is elose to the Bois de Boulogne, you will be able to amuse yourself
with a bit of shooting in the aftemoon."
"I do not like shooting," said Napoleon, "But I love hunting. Are there
any boars in the Bois de Boulogne?" Napoleon came from Corsica, where
boar hunting was a great sport. By asking if there were boars in a Paris
park, he showed hirnself still a provincial, almost a rube. Talleyrand did not
laugh, however, but he could not resist a practical joke on the man who
was now his master in politics, although not in blood and nobility, since
Talleyrand came from an old aristocratic family. To Napoleon's question,
then, he simply replied, "Very few, mon general, but I dare say you will man­
age to find one."
It was arranged that Napoleon would arrive at Talleyrand's house the
following day at seven A.M. and would spend the moming there. The "boar
hunt" would take place in the aftemoon. Throughout the moming the ex­
cited general talked nothing but boar hunting. Meanwhile, Talleyrand se­
cretly had his servants go to the market, buy two enormous black pigs, and
take them to the great park.
After lunch, the hunters and their hounds set off for the Bois de
Boulogne. At a secret signal from Talleyrand, the servants loosed one of the
pigs. "I see aboar," Napoleon cried joyfully, jumping onto his horse to give
chase. Talleyrand stayed behind. It took half an hour of galloping through
the park before the "boar" was finally captured. At the moment of triumph,
however, Napoleon was approached by one of his aides, who knew the
creature could not possibly be a boar, and feared the general would be
ridiculed once the story got out: "Sir," he told Napoleon, "you realize of
course that this is not a boar but a pig."
Flying into a rage, Napoleon immediately set off at a gallop for Tal­
leyrand's house. He realized along the way that he would now be the butt
of many a joke, and that exploding at Talleyrand would only make hirn
LAW 24 189

[PAGE 214]
more ridiculous; it would be better to make a show ofg ood humor. Still, he
did not hide his displeasure weIl.
Talleyrand decided to try to soothe the general's bruised ego. He told
Napoleon not to go back to Paris yet-he should again go hunting in the
park. There were many rabbits there, and hunting them had been a fa­
vorite pastime of Louis XVI. Talleyrand even offered to let Napoleon use a
set of guns that had once belonged to Louis. With much flattery and cajol­
ery, he once again got Napoleon to agree to a hunt.
The party left for the park in the late aftemoon. Along the way,
Napoleon told Talleyrand, "I'm not Louis XVI, I surely won't kill even one
rabbit." Yet that aftemoon, strangely enough, the park was teeming with
rabbits. Napoleon killed at least fifty of them, and his mood changed from
anger to satisfaction. At the end of his wild shooting spree, however, the
same aide approached hirn and whispered in his ear, "To tell the truth, sir, I
am beginning to believe these are not wild rabbits. I suspect that rascal Tal­
leyrand has played another joke on us." (The aide was right: Talleyrand
had in fact sent his servants back to the market, where they had purchased
dozens of rabbits and then had released them in the Bois de Boulogne.)
Napoleon immediately mounted his horse and galloped away, this
time retuming straight to Paris. He later threatened Talleyrand, wamed
hirn not to tell a soul what had happened; if he became the laughingstock
of Paris, there would be hell to pay.
It took months for Napoleon to be able to trust Talleyrand again, and
he never totally forgave hirn his humiliation.
Interpretation
Courtiers are like magicians: They deceptively play with appearances,
only letting those around them see what they want them to see. With so
much deception and manipulation afoot, it is essential to keep people from
seeing your tricks and glimpsing your sleight of hand.
Talleyrand was normally the Grand Wizard of Courtiership, and but
for Napoleon's aide, he probably would have gotten away completely with
both pleasing his master and having a joke at the general's expense. But
courtiership is a subtle art, and overlooked traps and inadvertent mistakes
can ruin your best tricks. Never risk being caught in your maneuvers;
never let people see your devices. If that happens you instantly pass in peo­
ple's perceptions from a courtier of great manners to a loathsome rogue. It
is a delicate game you play; apply the utrnost attention to covering your
tracks, and never let your master unmask you.

MEMOIRS,
GIOVANNI CASANOVA, After the defeat of Pompey, the entertainments grew in scale. Nothing
1725-1798 like them had ever been seen in Rome. The chariot races became more
spectacular, the gladiator fights more dramatic, as Caesar staged fights to
the death among the Roman nobility. He organized enormous mock naval
battles on an artificiallake. Plays were performed in every Roman ward. A

[PAGE 217]
giant new theater was built that sloped dramatically down the Tarpeian
Rock. Crowds from all over the empire flocked to these events, the roads to
Rome lined with visitors' tents. And in 45 B.C., timing his entry into the city
for maximum effect and surprise, Caesar brought Cleopatra back to Rome
after his Egyptian campaign, and staged even more extravagant public
spectacles.
These events were more than devices to divert the masses; they dra­
matically enhanced the public's sense of Caesar's character, and made hirn
seem larger than life. Caesar was the master of his public image, of which
he was forever aware. When he appeared before crowds he wore the most
spectacular purple robes. He would be upstaged by no one. He was notori­
ously vain about his appearance-it was said that one reason he enjoyed
being honored by the Senate and people was that on these occasions he
could wear a laurel wreath, hiding his baldness. Caesar was a masterful or­
ator. He knew how to say a lot by saying a little, intuited the moment to
end a speech for maximum effect. He never failed to incorporate a surprise
into his public appearances-a startling announcement that would
heighten their drama.
Immensely popular among the Roman people, Caesar was hated and
feared by his rivals. On the ides of March-March 15-in the year 44 B.C.,
a group of conspirators led by Brutus and Cassius surrounded hirn in the
senate and stabbed hirn to death. Even dying, however, he kept his sense of
drama. Drawing the top of his gown over his face, he let go of the cloth's
lower part so that it draped his legs, allowing hirn to die covered and de­
cent. According to the Roman historian Suetonius, his final words to his
old friend Brutus, who was about to deliver a second blow, were in Greek,
and as if rehearsed for the end of a play: "You too, my child?"
Interpretation
The Roman theater was an event for the masses, attended by crowds
unimaginable today. Packed into enormous auditoriums, the audience
would be amused by raucous comedy or moved by high tragedy. Theater
seemed to contain the essence of life, in its concentrated, dramatic form.
Like a religious ritual, it had a powerful, instant appeal to the common
man.
Julius Caesar was perhaps the first public figure to understand the vital
link between power and theater. This was because of his own obsessive in­
terest in drama. He sublimated this interest by making bimself an actor and
director on the world stage. He said his lines as if they had been scripted;
he gestured and moved through a crowd with a constant sense of how he
appeared to his audience. He incorporated surprise into his repertoire,
building drama into bis speeches, staging into his public appearances. His
gestures were broad enough for the common man to grasp them instantly.
He became immensely popular. .
Caesar set the ideal for all leaders and people of power. Like hirn, you
must learn to enlarge YOUf actions through dramatic techniques such as

surprise, suspense, the creation of sympathy, and symbolic identification.
Also like hirn, you must be constantly aware of your audience-o-- f what
will please them and what will bore them. You must arrange to place your­
self at the center, to command attention, and never to be upstaged at any
cost.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
In the year 1831, a young woman named Aurore Dupin Dudevant left her
husband and family in the provinces and moved to Paris. She wanted to be
a writer; marriage, she feIt, was worse than prison, for it left her neither the
time nor the freedom to pursue her passion. In Paris she would establish
her independence and make her living by writing.
Soon after Dudevant arrived in the capital, however, she had to con­
front certain harsh realities. To have any degree of freedom in Paris you
had to have money. For a woman, money could only come through mar­
riage or prostitution. No woman had ever come close to making a living by
writing. Women wrote as a hobby, supported by their husbands, or by an
inheritance. In fact when Dudevant first showed her writing to an editor,
he told her, "You should make babies, Madame, not literature."
Clearly Dudevant had come to Paris to attempt the impossible. In the
end, though, she came up with a strategy to do what no woman had ever
done-a strategy to re-create herself completely, forging a public image of
her own making. Women writers before her had been forced into a ready­
made role, that of the second-rate artist who wrote mostly for other
women. Dudevant decided that if she had to playa role, she would turn the
game around: She would play the part of a man.
In 1832 a publisher accepted Dudevant's first major novel, Indiana.
She had chosen to publish it under a pseudonym, "George Sand," and all
of Paris assumed this impressive new writer was male. Dudevant had
sometimes worn men's clothes before creating "George Sand" (she had al­
ways found men's shirts and riding breeches more comfortable); now, as
a public figure, she exaggerated the image. She added long men's coats,
gray hats, heavy boots, and dandyish cravats to her wardrobe. She smoked
cigars and in conversation expressed herself like a man, unafraid to domi­
nate the conversation or to use a saucy word.
This strange "malelfernale" writer fascinated the public. And unlike
other women writers, Sand found herself accepted into the clique of male
artists. She drank and smoked with them, even carried on afaf irs with the
most famous artists of Europe-M-- usset, Liszt, Chopin. It was she who did
the wooing, and also the abandoning-she moved on at her discretion.
Those who knew Sand well understood that her male persona pro­
tected her from the public's prying eyes. Out in the world, she enjoyed
playing the part to the extreme; in private she remained herself. She also
realized that the character of "George Sand" could grow stale or pre­
dictable, and to avoid this she would every now and then dramatically alter
194 LAW 25

[PAGE 219]
the character she had created; instead of conducting affairs with famous
men, she would begin meddling in politics, Ieading demonstrations, inspir­
ing student rebellions. No one would dictate to her the limits of the charac­
ter she had created. Long after she died, and after most people had stopped
reading her noveIs, the Iarger-than-life theatricality of that character has
eontinued to fascinate and inspire.
Interpretation
Throughout Sand's public life, acquaintances and other artists who spent
time in her company had the feeling they were in the presence of a man.
But in her journals and to her dosest friends, such as Gustave Flaubert, she
eonfessed that she had no desire to be a man, but was playing a part for
public consumption. What she really wanted was the power to determine
her own character. She refused the limits her society would have set on her.
She did not attain her power, however, by being herself; instead she cre­
ated a persona that she could constantly adapt to her own desires, a per­
sona that attracted attention and gave her presence.
Understand this: The world wants to assign you a role in life. And
onee you accept that role you are doomed. Your power is lirnited to the
tiny amount allotted to the role you have selected or have been forced to
assurne. An actor, on the other hand, plays many roles. Enjoy that protean
power, and if it is beyond you, at least forge a new identity, one of YOUf
own making, one that has had no boundaries assigned to it by an envious
and resentful world. This act of defiance is Promethean: It makes you re­
sponsible for your own creation.
Your new identity will protect you from the world precisely because it
is not "you"; it is a costume you put on and take off. You need not take it
personally. And your new identity sets you apart, gives you theatrical pres­
ence. Those in the back rows can see you and hear you. Those in the front
rows marvel at your audacity.
Do not people talk in society of a man being a great actor? They do not mean by
that that he feets, but that he excels in simulating, though he feets nothing.
Denis Diderot, 1713-1784
KEYS TO POWER
The character you seem to have been born with is not necessarily who you
are; beyond the characteristics you have inherited, YOUf parents, your
friends, and your peers have helped to shape your personality. The
Promethean task of the powerful is to take control of the process, to stop al­
lowing others that ability to limit and mold them. Remake YOUfself into a
eharacter of power. Working on yourself like day should be one of YOUf
greatest and most pleasurable Iife tasks. It makes you in essence an artist­
an artist creating YOUfself.
In fact, the idea of self-creation comes from the world of art. For thou-
LAW 25 195

[PAGE 220]
sands of years, only kings and the highest courtiers had the freedom to
shape their public image and determine their own identity. Similarly, only
kings and the wealthiest lords could contemplate their own image in art,
and consciously alter it. The rest of mankind played the limited role that
society demanded of them, and had little self-consciousness.
A shift in this condition can be detected in Veläzquez's painting Las
Meninas, made in 1656. The artist appears at the left of the canvas, standing
before a painting that he is in the process of creating, but that has its back
to us-we cannot see it. Beside hirn stands a princess, her attendants, and
one of the court dwarves, all watching hirn work. The people posing for the
painting are not directly visible, but we can see them in tiny reflections in a
mirror on the back wall-the king and queen of Spain, who must be sitting
somewhere in the foreground, outside the picture.
The painting represents a dramatic change in the dynamics of power
and the ability to determine one's own position in society. For Veläzquez,
the artist, is far more prominently positioned than the king and queen. In a
sense he is more powerful than they are, since he is clearly the one control­
ling the image-their image. Veläzquez no longer saw hirnself as the slav­
ish, dependent artist. He had remade hirnself into a man of power. And
indeed the first people other than aristocrats to play openly with their
image in Western society were artists and writers, and later on dandies and
bohemians. Today the concept of self-creation has slowly filtered down to
the rest of society, and has become an ideal to aspire to. Like Veläzquez,
you must demand for yourself the power to determine your position in the
painting, and to create your own image.
The first step in the process of self-creation is self-consciousness­
being aware of yourself as an actor and taking control of your appearance
and emotions. As Diderot said, the bad actor is the one who is always sin­
cere. People who wear their hearts on their sleeves out in society are tire­
some and embarrassing. Their sincerity notwithstanding, it is hard to take
them seriously. Those who cry in public may temporarily elicit sympathy,
but sympathy so on turns to scorn and irritation at their self­
obsessiveness-they are crying to get attention, we feel, and a malicious
part of us wants to deny them the satisfaction.
Good actors control themselves better. They can play sincere and
heartfelt, can affect a tear and a compassionate look at will, but they don't
have to feel it. They externalize emotion in a form that others can und er­
stand. Method acting is fatal in the real world. No mler or leader could
possibly play the part if all of the emotions he showed had to be real. So
leam self-control. Adopt the plasticity of the actor, who can mold his or her
face to the emotion required.
The second step in the process of self-creation is a variation on the
George Sand strategy: the creation of a memorable character, one that
compels attention, that stands out above the other players on the stage.
This was the game Abraham Lincoln played. The homespun, common
country man, he knew, was a kind of president that America had never had
196 LAW 25

[PAGE 221]
but would delight in electing. Although many of these qualities came natu­
rally to hirn, he played them up-the hat and clothes, the beard. (No presi­
dent before hirn had worn a beard.) Lincoln was also the first president to
use photographs to spread his image, helping to create the icon of the
"homespun president."
Good drama, however, needs more than an interesting appearance, or
a single stand-out moment. Drama takes place over time--it is an unfold­
ing event. Rhythm and timing are critical. One of the most important ele­
ments in the rhythm of drama is suspense. Houdini for instance, could
sometimes complete his escape acts in seconds-but he drew them out to
minutes, to make the audience sweat.
The key to keeping the audience on the edge of their seats is letting
events unfold slowly, then speeding them up at the right moment, accord­
ing to a pattern and tempo that you control. Great mlers from Napoleon to
Mao Tse-tung have used theatrical timing to surprise and divert their pub­
Iic. Franklin Delano Roosevelt understood the importance of staging politi­
cal events in a particular order and rhythm.
At the time of his 1932 presidential election, the United States was in
the midst of a dire economic crisis. Banks were failing at an alarming rate.
Shortly after winning the election, Roosevelt went into a kind of retreat.
He said nothing about his plans or his cabinet appointments. He even re­
fused to meet the sitting president, Herbert Hoover, to discuss the transi­
tion. By the time of Roosevelt's inauguration the country was in astate of
high anxiety.
In his inaugural address, Roosevelt shifted gears. He made a powernd
speech, making it clear that he intended to lead the country in a completely
new direction, sweeping away the timid ge stures of his predecessors. From
then on the pace of his speeches and public decisions-cabinet appoint­
ments, bold legislation-unfolded at an incredibly rapid rate. The period
after the inauguration became known as the "Hundred Days," and its suc­
cess in altering the country's mood partly stemmed from Roosevelt's clever
pacing and use of dramatic contrast. He held his audience in suspense,
then hit them with aseries of bold ge stures that seemed all the more mo­
mentous because they came from nowhere. You must leam to orchestrate
events in a similar manner, never revealing all your cards at once, but un­
folding them in a way that heightens their dramatic effect.
Besides covering a multitude of sins, good drama can also confuse and
deceive your enemy. During World War II, the German playwright Bertolt
Brecht worked in Hollywood as a screenwriter. After the war he was called
before the House Committee on Un-American Activities for his supposed
Communist sympathies. Other writers who had been called to testify
planned to humiliate the committee members with an angry emotional
stand. Brecht was wiser: He would play the committee like a violin, charm­
ing them while fooling them as weIl. He carefully rehearsed his responses,
and brought along some props, notably a cigar on which he puffed away,
knowing the head of the committee liked cigars. And indeed he proceeded
LAW 25 197

[PAGE 222]
to beguile the committee with well-crafted responses that were ambiguous,
funny, and double-edged. Instead of an angry, heartfelt tirade, he ran cir­
cles around them with a staged production, and they let hirn off scot-free.
Other dramatic effects for your repertoire include the beau geste, an
action at a climactic moment that symbolizes your triumph or your bold­
ness. Caesar's dramatic crossing of the Rubicon was a beau geste-a- move
that dazzled the soldiers and gave hirn heroic proportions. You must also
appreciate the importance of stage entrances and exits. When Cleopatra
first met Caesar in Egypt, she arrived rolled up in a carpet, which she
arranged to have unfurled at his feet. George Washington twice left power
with flourish and fanfare (first as a general, then as a president who refused
to sit for a third term), showing he knew how to make the moment count,
dramatically and symbolically. Your own entrances and exits should be
crafted and planned as carefully.
Remember that overacting can be counterproductive-i-t is another
way of spending too much effort trying to attract attention. The actor
Richard Burton discovered early in his career that by standing totally still
onstage, he drew attention to hirnself and away from the other actors. It is
less what you do that matters, clearly, than how you do it-your graceful­
ness and imposing stillness on the sodal stage count for more than overdo­
ing your part and moving around too much.
Finally: Learn to play many roles, to be whatever the moment re­
quires. Adapt your mask to the situation-be protean in the faces you wear.
Bismarck played this game to perfection: To a liberal he was a liberal, to a
hawk he was a hawk. He could not be grasped, and what cannot be

OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW II
For several years Cesare Borgia campaigned to gain control of large parts
of Italy in the name of his father, Pope Alexander. In the year 1500 he
managed to take Romagna, in northem Italy. The region had for years
been ruled by aseries of greedy masters who had plundered its wealth for
themselves. Without police or any disciplining force, it had descended into
lawlessness, whole areas being ruled by robbers and feuding families.
To establish order, Cesare appointed a lieutenant general of the region­
Remirro qe Orco, "a cruel and vigorous man," according to Niccolö
Machiavelli. Cesare gave de Orco absolute powers.
With energy and violence, de Orco established a severe, brutal justice
in Romagna, and so on rid it of almost all of its lawless elements. But in his
zeal he sometimes went too far, and after a couple of years the local popu­
lation resented and even hated hirn. In December of 1502, Cesare took de­
cisive action. He first let it be known that he had not approved of de Orco's
cruel and violent deeds, which stemmed from the lieutenant's brutal na­
ture. Then, on December 22, he imprisoned de Orco in the town of Ce­
sena, and the day after Christmas the townspeople awoke to find a strange
spectade in the middle ofthe piazza: de Orco's headless body, dressed in a
lavish suit with a purple cape, the head impaled beside it on a pike, the
bloody knife and executioner's block laid out beside the head. As Machi­
avelli concluded his comments on the affair, "The ferocity of this scene left
the people at once stunned and satisfied."
Interpretation
Cesare Borgia was a master player in the game of power. Always planning
several moves ahead, he set his opponents the cleverest traps. For this

[PAGE 227]
Cesare foresaw the future with amazing clarity in Romagna: Only bru­
tal justice would bring order to the region. The process would take several
years, and at first the people would welcome it. But it would soon make
many enemies, and the citizens would come to resent the imposition of
such unforgiving justice, especially by outsiders. Cesare hirnself, then,
could not be seen as the agent of this justice-the people's hatred would
cause too many problems in the future. And so he chose the one man who
could do the dirty work, knowing in advance that once the task was done
he would have to display de Orco's head on a pike. The scapegoat in this
case had been planned from the beginning.
With Ts'ao Ts'ao, the scapegoat was an entirely innocent man; in the
Romagna, he was the offensive weapon in Cesare's arsenal that let hirn get
the dirty work done without bloodying his own hands. With this second
kind of scapegoat it is wise to separate yourself from the hatchet man at
some point, either leaving hirn dangling in the wind or, like Cesare, even
making yourself the one to bring hirn to justice. Not only are you free of in­
volvement in the problem, you can appear as the one who cleaned it up.

The Colden Bough, Sir!ames George Frazer, 1854-1941
KEYS TO POWER
The use of scapegoats is as old as civilization itself, and examples of it can
be found in cultures around the world. The main idea behind these sacri­
fices is the shifting of guilt and sin to an outside figure-object, animal, or
man-which is then banished or destroyed. The Hebrews used to take a
live goat (hence the term "scapegoat") upon whose head the priest would
lay both hands while confessing the sins of the Children of Israel. Having
thus had those sins transferred to it, the be ast would be led away and aban­
doned in the wildemess. With the Athenians and the Aztecs, the scapegoat
was human, often a person fed and raised for the purpose. Since famine
and plague were thought to be visited on humans by the gods, in punish­
ment for wrongdoing, the people suffered not only from the famine and
plague themselves but from blame and guilt. They freed themselves of guilt
by transferring it to an innocent person, whose death was intended to sat­
isfy the divine powers and banish the evil from their midst.
It is an extremely human response to not look inward after amistake
or crime, but rather to look outward and to affix blame and guilt on a con­
venient object. When the plague was ravaging Thebes, Oedipus looked
everywhere for its cause, everywhere except inside hirnself and his own sin
of incest, which had so offended the gods and occasioned the plague. This
profound need to exteriorize one's guilt, to project it on another person or
object, has an immense power, which the clever know how to hamess. Sac-
LAW 26 203

[PAGE 228]
rifice is a ritual, perhaps the most ancient ritual of all; ritual too is a well­
spring of power. In the killing of de Orco, note Cesare's symbolic and ritu­
alistic display of his body. By framing it in this dramatic way he focused
guilt outward. The citizens of Romagna responded instantly. Because it
comes so naturally to us to look outward rather than inward, we readily ac­
cept the scapegoat's guilt.
The bloody sacrifice of the scapegoat seems a barbaric relic of the
past, but the practice lives on to this day, if indirectly and symbolically;
since power depends on appearances, and those in power must seem never
to make mistakes, the use of scapegoats is as popular as ever. What modem
leader will take responsibility for his blunders? He searches out others
to blame, a scapegoat to sacrifice. When Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Rev­
olution failed miserably, he made no apologies or excuses to the Chinese
people; instead, like Ts'ao Ts'ao before hirn, he offered up scapegoats, in­
du ding his own personal secretary and high-ranking memher of the Party,
eh'e n Po-ta.
Franklin D. Roosevelt had a reputation for honesty and fairness.
Throughout his career, however, he faced many situations in which being
the nice guy would have spelled political disaster-yet he could not be
seen as the agent of any foul play. For twenty years, then, his secretary,
Louis Howe, played the role de Orco had. He handled the backroom deals,
the manipulation of the press, the underhanded campaign maneuvers. And
whenever a mistake was committed, or a dirty trick contradicting Roo­
sevelt's carefully crafted image became public, Howe served as the scape­
goat, and never complained.
Besides conveniently shifting biarne, a scapegoat can serve as a wam­
ing to others. In 1631 a plot was hatched to oust France's Cardinal Riche­
lieu from power, a plot that became known as "The Day of the Dupes." It
almost succeeded, since it involved the upper echelons of govemment, in­
duding the queen mother. But through luck and his own connivances,
Richelieu survived.
One of the key conspirators was a man named Marillac, the keeper of
the seals. Richelieu could not imprison him without implicating the queen
mother, an extremely dangerous tactic, so he targeted Marillac's brother, a
marshai in the army. This man had no involvement in the plot. Richelieu,
however, afraid that other conspiracies might be in the air, especially in the
army, decided to set an example. He tried the brother on trumped-up
charges and had hirn executed. In this way he indirectly punished the real
perpetrator, who had thought hirnself protected, and warned any future
conspirators that he would not shrink from sacrificing the innocent to pro-
tect his own power. ,

In fact it is often wise to choose the most i ocent victim possible as a
sacrificial goat. Such people will not be powerful enough to fight you, and
their naive protests may be seen as protesting too much-may be seen, in
other words, as a sign of their guilt. Be careful, however, not to create a
martyr. It is important that you remain the victim, the poor leader betrayed
204 LAW 26

[PAGE 229]
by the incompetence of those around you. If the scapegoat appears too
weak and his punishment too cruel, you may end up the victim of your
own device. Sometimes you should find a more powerful scapegoat-one
who will elicit less sympathy in the long run.
In this vein, history has time and again shown the value of using a
elose associate as a scapegoat. This is known as the "fall of the favorite."
Most kings had a personal favorite at court, a man whom they singled out,
sometimes for no apparent reason, and lavished with favors and attention.
But this court favorite could serve as a convenient scapegoat in case of a
threat to the king's reputation. The public would readily believe in the
scapegoat's guilt-why would the king sacrifice his favorite unless he were
guilty? And the other courtiers, resentful of the favorite anyway, would re­
joice at his downfall. The king, meanwhile, would rid hirnself of a man who
by that time had probably learned too much about hirn, perhaps becoming
arrogant and even disdainful of hirn. Choosing a elose associate as a scape­
goat has the same value as the "fall of the favorite." You may lose a friend
or aide, but in the long-term scheme of things, it is more important to hide
your mistakes than to hold on to someone who one day will probably turn
against you. Besides, you can always find a new favorite to take hi� place.
Image: The Innocent Goat. On
the Day of Atonement, the high
priest brings the goat into the
temple, places his hands on its
head, and confesses the peo­
ple's sins, transferring guilt to
the guiltless beast, which is
then led to the wildemess and
abandoned, the people's sins
and blame vanishing with hirn.
Authority: Folly consists not in committing Folly, but in being
incapable of concealing it. All men make mistakes, but the wise
conceal the blunders they have made, while fools make them pub­
lic. Reputation depends more on what is hidden than on what is
seen. If you can't be good, be careful. (Baltasar Graciän, 1601-1658)

On the eve of an important river battle, the great third-century Chi­
nese strategist Chuko Liang found hirnself falsely accused of secretly work­
ing for the other side. As proof of his loyalty, his commander ordered hirn
to produce 100,000 arrows for the army within three days, or be put to
death. Instead of trying to manufacture the arrows, an impossible task,
Liang took a dozen boats and had bundles of straw lashed to their sides. In
the late afternoon, when mist always blanketed the river, he floated the
boats toward the enemy camp. Fearing a trap from the wily Chuko Liang,
the enemy did not attack the barely visible boats with boats of their own,

Finally, you may well find cases in which deliberately offering yourself
as the cat's-paw will ultimately gain you great power. This is the ruse of the
perfect courtier. Its symbol is Sir Walter Raleigh, who once placed his own
cloak on the muddy ground so that Queen Elizabeth would not sully her
shoes. As the instrument that protects a master or peer from unpleasant­
ness or danger, you gain immense respect, which sooner or later will pay
dividends. And remember: If you can make your assistance subtle and gra­
cious rather than boastful and burdensome, your recompense will be that
much the more satisfying and powerful.

REVERSAL
The cat's-paw and the scapegoat must be used with extreme caution and
delicacy. They are like screens that hide your own involvement in dirty
work from the public; if at any moment the screen is lifted and you are
seen as the manipulator, the puppet master, the whole dynamic turns
around-your hand will be seen everywhere, and you will be blamed for
misfortunes you may have had nothing to do with. Once the truth is re­
vealed, events will snowball beyond your control.
In 1572, Queen Catherine de' Medicis of France conspired to do away
with Gaspard de Coligny, an admiral in the French navy and a leading
member of the Huguenot (French Protestant) community. Coligny was
elose to Catherine's son, Charles IX, and she feared his growing influence
on the young king. So she arranged for a member of the Guise family, one
of the most powernd royal elans in France, to assassinate hirn.
Secretly, however, Catherine had another plan: She wanted the Hu­
guenots to blame the Guises for killing one of their leaders, and to take re­
venge. With one blow, she would erase or injure two threatening rivals,
Coligny and the Guise family. Yet both plans went awry. The assassin
missed his target, only wounding Coligny; knowing Catherine as his
enemy, he strongly suspected it was she who had set up the attack on hirn,
and he told the king so. Eventually the failed assassination and the argu­
ments that ensued from it set off achain of events that led to a bloody civil
war between Catholics and Protestants, culminating in the harrifying Mas­
sacre of St. Bartholomew's Eve, in which thousands of Protestants were
killed.
If you have to use a cat's-paw or a scapegoat in an action of great con­
sequence, be very careful: Too much can go wrong. It is often wiser to use
such dupes in more innocent endeavors, where mistakes or miscalculations
will cause no serious harm.
Finally, there are moments when it is advantageous to not disguise
your involvement or responsibility, but rather to take the blame yourself
far some mistake. If you have power and are secure in it, you should some­
times play the penitent: With a sorrowful look, you ask for forgiveness
from those weaker than you. It is the ploy of the king who makes a show of
his own sacrifices far the good of the people. Similarly, upon occasion you
may want to appear as the agent of punishment in order to instill fear and
trembling in your subordinates. Instead of the cat's-paw you show your
own mighty hand as a threatening gesture. Play such a card sparingly. If
you play it too often, fear will turn into resentrnent and hatred. Before you
know it, such emotions will spark a vigorous opposition that will someday
bring you down. Get in the habit of using a cat's-paw-it is far safer.

This is the lesson that Mesmer teaches us: Our tendency to doubt, the
distance that allows us to reason, is broken down when we join a group.
The warmth and infectiousness of the group overwhelm the skeptical indi­
vidual. This is the power you gain by creating a cult. Also, by playing on
people's repressed sexuality, you lead them into mistaking their excited
feelings for signs of your mystical strength. You gain untold power by
working on people's unrealized desire for a kind of promiscuous and

One reason to create a following is that a group is often easier to deceive
than an individual, and turns over to you that much more power. This
comes, however, with a danger: If at any moment the group sees through
you, you will find yourself facing not one deceived soul but an angry crowd
that will tear you to pieces as avidly as it once followed you. The charlatans
constantly faced this danger, and were always ready to move out of town as
it inevitably became clear that their elixirs did not work and their ideas
were sham. Too slow and they paid with their lives. In playing with the
crowd, you are playing with fire, and must constantly keep an eye out far
any sparks of doubt, any enemies who will turn the crowd against you.
When you play with the emotions of a crowd, you have to know how to
adapt, attuning yourself instantaneously to all of the moods and desires that
a group will produce. Use spies, be on top of everything, and keep yOUf
bags packed.
For this reason you may often prefer to deal with people one by one.
Isolating them from their normal milieu can have the same effect as putting
them in a group--it makes them more prone to suggestion and intimida­
tion. Choose the right sucker and if he eventually sees through you he may
prove easier to escape than a crowd.

Ify ou are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it.

Timidity is dangerous: Better to enter with boldness. Any

Boldness should never be the strategy behind all of your actions. It is a tac­

long pattern of violence and sadism. He lost the ability to tell when
boldness was appropriate and when it was not.
Timidity has no place in the realm of power; you will often benefit,
however, by being able to feign it. At that point, of course, it is no longer
timidity but an offensive weapon: You are luring people in with your show
of shyness, all the better to pounce on them boldly later.

on the path to conquest, there was no telling where he would stop. And,
indeed, three years later Bismarck provoked a war with France. First he
appeared to give his permission to France's annexation of Belgium, then
at the last moment he changed his mind. Playing a cat-and-mouse garne,
he infuriated the French emperor, Napoleon III, and stirred up his own
king against the French. To no one's surprise, war broke out in 1870. The
newly formed German federation enthusiastically joined in the war
on France, and once again the Prussian military machine and its allies
destroyed the enemy army in a matter of months. Although Bismarck
opposed taking any French land, the generals convinced him that Alsace­
Lorraine would become part of the federation.
Now all of Europe feared the next move of the Prussian monster, led
by Bismarck, the "lron Chancellor." And in fact a year later Bismarck
founded the German Empire, with the Prussian king as the newly
crowned emperor and Bismarck himself a prince. But then something
strange happened: Bismarck instigated no more wars. And while the other
European powers grabbed up land for colonies in other continents, he se­
verely limited Germany's colonial acquisitions. He did not want more
land for Germany, but more security. For the rest ofhis life he struggled to
maintain peace in Europe and to prevent further wars. Everybody as­
sumed he had changed, mellowing with the years. They had failed to un­
derstand: This was the final move of his original plan.
Interpretation
There is a simple reason why most men never know when to come off the
attack: They form no concrete idea of their goal. Once they achieve vic­
tory they only hunger for more. To stop-to aim for a goal and then keep
to it-seems almost inhuman, in fact; yet nothing is more critical to the
maintenance of power. The person who goes too far in his triumphs cre­
ates areaction that inevitably leads to a decline. The only solution is to
plan for the long run. Foresee the future with as much clarity as the gods
on Mount Olympus, who look through the clouds and see the ends of all
things.
From the beginning of his career in politics, Bismarck had one goal:
to form an independent German state led by Prussia. He instigated the
war with Denmark not to conquer territory but to stir up Prussian nation­
alism and unite the country. He incited the war with Austria only to gain
240 LAW 29

[PAGE 265]
Prussian independence. (This was why he refused to grab Austrian terri­
tory.) And he fomented the war with France to unite the German king­
doms against a common enemy, and thus to prepare for the formation of a
united Germany.
Once this was achieved, Bismarck stopped. He never let triumph go
to his head, was never tempted by the siren call of more. He held the reins
tightly, and whenever the generals, or the king, or the Prussian people de­
manded new conquests, he held them back. Nothing would spoil the
beauty of his creation, certainly not a false euphoria that pushed those
around hirn to attempt to go past the end that he had so carefully planned.
Expenence shows that, if one foresees from far away the designs to be
undertaken, one can act with speed when the moment comes to execute them.
Cardinal Richelieu, 1585-1642
KEYS TO POWER
According to the cosmology of the ancient Greeks, the gods were thought
to have complete vision into the future. They saw everything to come,
right down to the intricate details. Men, on the other hand, were seen as
victims of fate, trapped in the moment and their emotions, unable to see
beyond immediate dangers. Those heroes, such as Odysseus, who were
able to look beyond the present and plan several steps ahead, seemed to
defy fate, to approximate the gods in their ability to determine the future.
The comparison is still valid-those among us who think further ahead
and patiently bring their plans to fruition seem to have a godlike power.
Because most people are too imprisoned in the moment to plan with
this kind of foresight, the ability to ignore immediate dangers and plea­
sures translates into power. It is the power of being able to overcome the
natural human tendency to react to things as they happen, and instead to
train oneself to step back, imagining the larger things taking shape beyond
one's immediate vision. Most people believe that they are in fact aware of
the future, that they are planning and thinking ahead. They are usually de­
luded: What they are really doing is succumbing to their desires, to what
they want the future to be. Their plans are vague, based on their imagina­
tions rather than their reality. They may believe they are thinking all the
way to the end, but they are really only focusing on the happy ending, and
deluding themselves by the strength of their desire.
In 415 B.C., the ancient Athenians attacked Sicily, believing their ex­
pedition would bring them riches, power, and a glorious ending to the six­
teen-year Peloponnesian War. They did not consider the dangers of an
invasion so far from horne; they did not foresee that the Sicilians would
fight all the harder since the battles were in their own homeland, or that
all of Athens's enemies would band together against them, or that war
would break out on several fronts, stretching their forces way too thin.
The Sicilian expedition was a complete dis aster, leading to the destruction
LAW 29 241

[PAGE 266]
of one of the greatest civilizations of all time. The Athenians were led into
this disaster by their hearts, not their minds. They saw only the chance of
glory, not the dangers that loomed in the distance.
Cardinal de Retz, the seventeenth-century Frenchman who prided
himself on his insights into human schemes and why they mostly fail, ana­
lyzed this phenomenon. In the course of a rebellion he spearheaded
against the French monarchy in 1651, the young king, Louis XIV, and his
court had suddenly left Paris and established themselves in a palace out­
side the capital. The presence of the king so dose to the heart of the revo­
lution had been a tremendous burden on the revolutionaries, and they
breathed a sigh of relief. This later proved their downfall, however, since
the court's absence from Paris gave it much more room to maneuver.
"The most ordinary cause of people's mistakes," Cardinal de Retz later
wrote, "is their being too much frightened at the present danger, and not
enough so at that which is remote."
The dangers that are remote, that 100m in the distance-if we can see
them as they take shape, how many mistakes we avoid. How many plans
we would instantly abort if we realized we were avoiding a small danger
only to step into a larger one. So much of power is not what you do but
what you do not do-the rash and foolish actions that you refrain from be­
fore they get you into trouble. Plan in detail bef ore you act-do not let
vague plans lead you into trouble. Will this have unintended conse­
quences? Will I stir up new enemies? Will someone else take advantage of
my labors? Unhappy endings are much more common than happy
ones-do not be swayed by the happy ending in your mind.
The French elections of 1848 came down to a struggle between Louis­
Adolphe Thiers, the man of order, and General Louis Eugene Cavaignac,
the rabble-rouser of the right. When Thiers realized he was hopelessly be­
hind in this high-stakes race, he searched desperately for a solution. His
eye fell on Louis Bonaparte, grand-nephew ofthe great general Napoleon,
and a lowly deputy in the parliament. This Bonaparte seemed a bit of an
imbecile, but his name alone could get him elected in a country yearning
for a strong ruler. He would be Thiers's puppet and eventually would be
pushed offstage. The first part of the plan worked to perfection, and
Napoleon was elected by a large margin. The problem was that Thiers
had not foreseen one simple fact: This "imbecile" was in fact a man of
enormous ambition. Three years later he dissolved parliament, dedared
himself emperor, and ruled France for another eighteen years, much to
the horror of Thiers and his party.
The ending is everything. It is the end of the action that determines
who gets the glory, the money, the prize. Your condusion must be crystal
clear, and you must keep it constantly in mind. You must also figure out
how to ward off the vultures circling overhead, trying to live off the car­
cass of your creation. And you must anticipate the many possible crises
that will tempt you to improvise. Bismarck overcame these dangers be­
cause he planned to the end, kept on course through every crisis, and
242 LAW 29

[PAGE 267]
never let others steal the glory. Once he had reached his stated goal, he
withdrew into his shelllike a turtle. This kind of self-control is godlike.
When you see several steps ahead, and plan your moves all the way
to the end, you will no longer be tempted by emotion or by the desire to
improvise. Your elarity will rid you of the anxiety and vagueness that are
the primary reasons why so many fail to conelude their actions success­
fully. You see the ending and you tolerate no deviation.

REVERSAL
It is a diche among strategists that your plan must indude alternatives and
have a degree of flexibility. That is certainly true. If you are locked into a
plan too rigidly, you will be unable to deal with sudden shifts of fortune.
Once you have examined the future possibilities and decided on your tar­
get, you must build in alternatives and be open to new routes toward your
goal.
Most people, however, lose less from overplanning and rigidity than
from vagueness and a tendency to improvise constantly in the face of cir­
cumstance. There is no real purpose in contemplating a reversal to this
Law, then, for no good can come from refusing to think far into the future
and planning to the end. If you are dear- and far-thinking enough, you
will understand that the future is uncertain, and that you must be open to
adaptation. Only having a dear objective and a far-reaching plan allows
you that freedom.

THE CRAFT OF POWER,
R.G. H. SlU, 1979 Over the years, Houdini escaped from the chained carcass of an em­
balmed "sea monster" (a half octopus, half whalelike beast that had
beached near Boston); he had himself sealed inside an enormous envelope
from which he emerged without breaking the paper; he passed through
brick walls; he wriggled free from strailjackets while dangling high in the
air; he leaped from bridges into icy waters, his hands manaeled and his legs
in chains; he had himself submerged in glass cases full ofwater, hands pad­
locked, while the audience watched in amazement as he worked himself
free, struggling for elose to an hour apparently without breathing. Each
time he seemed to court certain death yet survived with superhuman
aplomb. Meanwhile, he said nothing about his methods, gave no elues as
to how he accomplished any of his tricks-he left his audiences and critics
speculating, his power and reputation enhanced by their struggles with the
inexplicable, Perhaps the most baffling trick of all was making a ten-thou­
sand-pound elephant disappear before an audience's eyes, a feat he re­
peated on stage for over nineteen weeks. No one has ever really explained
how he did this, for in the auditorium where he performed the trick, there
was simply nowhere for an elephant to hide.
The effortlessness of Houdini's escapes led some to think he used oc­
cuIt forces, his superior psychic abilities giving him special control over his
body. But a German escape artist named Kleppini elaimed to know Hou­
dini's secret: He simply used elaborate gadgets, Kleppini also elaimed to

Interpretation
Although we do not know for eertain how Houdini aeeomplished many of
his most ingenious eseapes, one thing is clear: It was not the oeeult, or any
kind of magie, that gave him his powers, but hard work and endless prae­
tice, all of whieh he earefully eoneealed from the world. Houdini never left
anything to ehanee-day and night he studied the workings of locks, re­
searehed eenturies-old sleight-of-hand tricks, pored over books on meehan­
ics, whatever he eould use. Every moment not spent researehing he spent
working his body, keeping hirnself exeeptionally limber, and learning how
to eontrol his muscles and his breathing.
Early on in Houdini's eareer, an old Japanese performer whom he
toured with taught hirn an ancient trick: how to swallow an ivory ball, then
bring it baek up. He practieed this endlessly with a small peeled potato tied
to a string-up and down he would manipulate the potato with his throat
muscles, until they were strong enough to move it without the string. The
organizers of the London handeuff challenge had searehed Houdini's body
thoroughly beforehand, but no one eould cheek the inside of his throat,
where he eould have eoneealed small tools to help hirn eseape. Even so,
Kleppini was fundamentally wrong: It was not Houdini's tools but his prae­
tiee, work, and research that made his eseapes possible.
Kleppini, in fact, was eompletely outwitted by Houdini, who set the
whole thing up. He let his opponent learn the eode to the Freneh euffs,
LAW 30 249

[PAGE 274]
then baited hirn into choosing those cuffs onstage. Then, during the two
men's tussle, the dexterous Houdini was able to change the code to ''F-R­
A-U-D." He had spent weeks practicing this trick, but the audience saw
none of the sweat and toil behind the scenes. Nor was Houdini ever ner­
vous; he induced nervousness in others. (He deliberately dragged out the
time it would take to escape, as a way of heightening the drama, and mak­
ing the audience squirm.) His escapes from death, always graceful and
easy, made hirn look like a superman.
As a person of power, you must research and practice endlessly before
appearing in public, onstage or anywhere else. Never expose the sweat and
labor behind your poise. Some think such exposure will demonstrate their
diligence and honesty, but it actually just makes them look weaker-as if
anyone who practiced and worked at it could do what they had done, or as
if they weren't really up to the job. Keep your effort and your tricks to
yourself and you seem to have the grace and ease of a god. One never sees
the source of a god's power revealed; one only sees its effects.

KEYS TO POWER
Humanity's first notions of power came from primitive encounters with na­
ture-the flash of lightning in the sky, a sudden flood, the speed and feroc­
ity of a wild animal. These forces required no thinking, no planning-they
awed us by their sudden appearance, their gracefulness, and their power
over life and death. And this remains the kind of power we have always
wanted to imitate. Through science and technology we have re-created the
speed and sublime power of nature, but something is missing: Our ma­
chines are noisy and jerky, they reveal their effort. Even the very best cre­
ations of technology cannot root out our admiration for things that move
easily and effortlessly. The power of children to bend us to their will comes
from a kind of seductive charm that we feel in the presence of a creature
less reflective and more graceful than we are. We cannot return to such a
state, but if we can create the appearance of this kind of ease, we elicit in
others the kind of primitive awe that nature has always evoked in hu­
·mankind.
One of the first European writers to expound on this principle came
from that most unnatural of environments, the Renaissance court. In 17ze
Book of the Courtier, published in 1528, Baldassare Castiglione describes the
highly elaborate and codified manners of the perfect court citizen. And yet,
Castiglione explains, the courtier must execute these gestures with what he
calls spre;zatura, the capacity to make the difficult seem easy. He urges the
courtier to "practice in all things a certain nonchalance which conceals all
250 LAW 30

[PAGE 275]
artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effort­
less." We all admire the achievement of some unusual feat, but if it is ac­
complished naturally and gracefully, our admiration increases tenfold­
"whereas . . . to labor at what one is doing and . . . to make bones over it,
shows an extreme lack of grace and causes everything, whatever its worth,
to be discounted."
Much of the idea of sprezzatura came from the world of art. All the
great Renaissance artists carefully kept their works under wraps. Only the
finished masterpiece could be shown to the public. Michelangelo forbade
even popes to view his work in process. A Renaissance artist was always
careful to keep his studios shut to patrons and public alike, not out of fear
of imitation, but because to see the making of the works would mar the
magic of their effect, and their studied atrnosphere of ease and natural
beauty.
The Renaissance painter Vasari, also the first great art critic, ridiculed
the work of Paolo Uccello, who was obsessed with the laws of perspective.
The effort Uccello spent on improving the appearance of perspective was
too obvious in his work-it made his paintings ugly and labored, over­
whelmed by the effort of their effects. We have the same response when we
watch performers who put too much effort into their act: Seeing them try­
ing so hard breaks the illusion. 1t also makes us uncomfortable. Calm,
graceful performers, on the other hand, set us at ease, creating the illusion
that they are not acting but being natural and themselves, even when
everything they are doing involves labor and practice.
The idea of sprezzatura is relevant to all forms of power, for power
depends vitally on appearances and the illusions you create. Your public
actions are like artworks: They must have visual appeal, must create antici­
pation, even entertain. When you reveal the inner workings of your cre­
ation, you become just one more morta1 among others. What is
understandable is not awe-inspiring-we tell ourselves we could do as well
if we had the money and time. Avoid the temptation of showing how
clever you are-it is far more clever to conceal the mechanisms of your
cleverness.
Talleyrand's application of this concept to his daily life greatly en­
hanced the aura of power that surrounded him. He never liked to work too
hard, so he made others do the work for him-the spying, the research, the
detailed analyses. With all this labor at his disposal, he hirnself never
seemed to strain. When his spies revealed that a certain event was about to
take place, he would talk in social conversation as if he sensed its immi­
nence. The result was that people thought he was clairvoyant. His short
pithy statements and witticisms always seemed to summarize a situation
perfectly, but they were based on much research and thought. To those in
government, including Napoleon hirnself, Talleyrand gave the impression
of immense power-an effect entirely dependent on the apparent ease
with which he accomplished his feats.
There is another reason for concealing your shortcuts and tricks:
LAW 30 251

[PAGE 276]
When you let this information out, you give people ideas they can use
against you. You lose the advantages of keeping silent. We tend to want the
world to know what we have done-w- e want our vanity gratified by hav­
ing OUf hard work and cleverness applauded, and we may even want sym­
pathy for the hOUfS it has taken to reach OUf point of artistry. Learn to
control this propensity to blab, for its effect is often the opposite of what
you expected. Remember: The more mystery surrounds YOUf actions, the
more awesome your power seems. You appear to be the only one who can
do what you do-and the appearance of having an exclusive gift is im­
mensely powernd. Finally, because you achieve YOUf accomplishments
with grace and ease, people believe that you could always do more if you
tried harder. This elicits not only admiration but a touch of fear. YOUf pow­
ers are untapped-no one can fathom their limits.
Image: The Racehorse. From up close we would see the
strain, the effort to control the horse, the labored, painful
breathing. But from the distance where we sit and watch, it
is all gracefulness, flying through the air. Keep others at a
distance and they will only see the ease with which you move.
Authority: For whatever action [nonchalance] accompanies, no
matter how trivial it is, it not only reveals the skill of the person
doing it but also very often causes it to be considered far greater
than it really iso This is because it makes the onlookers believe that
a man who performs weIl with so much facility must possess even
greater skill than he does. (Baldassare Castiglione, 1478-1529)
REVERSAL
The secrecy with which you surround YOUf actions must seem lighthearted
in spirit. A zeal to conceal YOUf work creates an unpleasant, almost para­
noiac impression: you are taking the game too seriously. Houdini was care­
ful to make the concealment of his tricks seem agame, all part of the show.
Never show YOUf work until it is finished, but if you put too much effort
into keeping it under wraps you will be like the painter Pontormo, who
spent the last years of his life hiding his frescoes from the public eye and
only succeeded in driving hirnself mad. Always keep your sense of humor
about yourself.
There are also times when revealing the inner workings of your pro­
jects can prove worthwhile. It all depends on YOUf audience's taste, and on
252 LAW 30

[PAGE 277]
the times in which you operate. P. T. Barnum recognized that his public
wanted to feel involved in his shows, and that understanding his tricks de­
lighted them, partly, perhaps, because implicitly debunking people who
kept their sources of power hidden from the masses appealed to America's
democratic spirit. The public also appreciated the showman's humor and
honesty. Bamum took this to the extreme of publicizing his own humbug­
gery in his popular autobiography, written when his career was at its
height.
As long as the partial disclosure of tricks and techniques is carefully
planned, rather than the result of an uncontrollable need to blab, it is the
ultimate in cleverness. It gives the audience the illusion of being superior
and involved, even while much of what you do remains concealed from
them.

court boarded the sleds and left town. Without explaining why, he estab­
lished hirnself in a village south of Moscow. For an entire month a kind of
terror gripped the capital, for the Muscovites feared that Ivan had aban­
doned them to the bloodthirsty boyars. Shops closed up and riotous mobs
gathered daily. Finally, on January 3 of 1565, a letter arrived from the czar,
explaining that he could no longer bear the boyars' betrayals and had de­
cided to abdicate once and for all.
Read aloud in public, the letter had a startling effect: Merchants and
commoners blamed the boyars for Ivan's decision, and took to the streets,
terrifying the nobility with their fury. Soon a group of delegates represent­
ing the church, the princes, and the people made the joumey to Ivan's vil­
lage, and begged the czar, in the name of the holy land of Russia, to return
to the throne. Ivan listened but would not change his mind. After days of
hearing their pleas, however, he offered his subjects a choice: Either they
grant hirn absolute powers to govern as he pleased, with no interference
frorn the boyars, or they find a new leader.
Faced with a choice between civil war and the acceptance of despotie
power, almost every sector of Russian society "opted" for a strong czar,
calling for Ivan's return to Moscow and the restoration oflaw and order. In

scandalized the queen mother and her court. Much to their horror, how­

helping Ninon to maintain her lifestyle and her glittering salon, accompa­

Even more distinguished were the martyrs, enjoying her company without
paying for it and maintaining the hope, however remote, of some day be­

options narrowed, as fewer men chose her. To avoid a life of poverty she
had to amass her fortune while she was young. The courtesan's legendary

KEYS TO POWER
Words like "freedom," "options," and "choice" evoke apower of possibility
far beyond the reality of the benefits they entail. When examined closely,
the choices we have-in the marketplace, in elections, in our jobs-tend to
have noticeable limitations: They are often a matter of a choice simply be­
tween A and B, with the rest of the alphabet out of the pieture. Yet as long
as the faintest mirage of choice flickers on, we rarely focus on the missing
options. We "choose" to believe that the game is fair, and that we have our
freedom. We prefer not to think too much about the depth of our liberty to
choose.
This unwillingness to probe the smallness of our choices sterns from
the fact that too much freedom creates a kind of anxiety. The phrase "un­
limited options" sounds infinitely promising, but unlimited options would
actually paralyze us and cloud our ability to choose. Our limited range of
choices comforts uso
258 LAW 31

[PAGE 283]
This supplies the clever and cunning with enormous opportunities for
deception. For people who are choosing between alternatives find it hard
to believe they are being manipulated or deceived; they cannot see that
you are allowing them a small amount of free will in exchange for a much
more powerful imposition of your own will. Setting up a narrow range of
choices, then, should always be a part of your deceptions. There is a say­
ing: If you can get the bird to walk into the cage on its own, it will sing that
much more prettily.
The following are among the most common forms of "controlling the
options":
Color the Choices. This was a favored technique of Henry Kissinger. As
President Richard Nixon's secretary of state, Kissinger considered hirnself
better informed than his boss, and believed that in most situations he could
make the best decision on his own. But if he tried to determine policy, he
would offend or perhaps enrage a notoriously insecure man. So Kissinger
would propose three or four choices of action for each situation, and would
present them in such a way that the one he preferred always seemed the
best solution compared to the others. Time after time, Nixon fell for the
bait, never suspecting that he was moving where Kissinger pushed hirn.
This is an excellent device to use on the insecure master.
Force the Resister. One of the main problems faced by Dr. Milton H. Er­
ickson, a pioneer of hypnosis therapy in the 1950s, was the relapse. His pa­
tients might seem to be recovering rapidly, but their apparent susceptibility
to the therapy masked a deep resistance: They would soon relapse into old
habits, blame the doctor, and stop coming to see hirn. To avoid this, Erick­
son began ordering some patients to have a relapse, to make themselves feel
as bad as when they first came in-to go back to square one. Faced with
this option, the patients would usually "choose" to avoid the relapse­
which, of course, was what Erickson really wanted.
This is a good technique to use on children and other willful people
who enjoy doing the opposite of what you ask them to: Push them to
"choose" what you want them to do by appearing to advocate the opposite.
Alter the Playing Field. In the 1860s, John D. Rockefeller set out to cre­
ate an oil monopoly. If he tried to buy up the smaller oil companies they
would figure out what he was doing and fight back. Instead, he began se­
cretly buying up the railway companies that transported the oil. When he
then attempted to take over a particular company, and met with resistance,
he reminded them of their dependence on the rails. Refusing them ship­
ping, or simply raising their fees, could ruin their business. Rockefeller al­
tered the playing field so that the only options the small oil producers had
were the ones he gave them.
In this tactic your opponents know their hand is being forced, but it
doesn't matter. The technique is effective against those who resist at all
costs.
LAW 31 259

[PAGE 284]
The Shrinking Options. The late-nineteenth-century art dealer Am­
broise Vollard perfected this technique.
Customers would come to Vollard's shop to see some Cezannes. He
would show three paintings, neglect to mention a price, and pretend to
doze off. The visitors would have to leave without deciding. They would
usually come back the next day to see the paintings again, but this time
Vollard would pull out less interesting works, pretending he thought they
were the same ones. The baffled customers would look at the new offer­
ings, leave to think them over, and return yet again. Once again the same
thing would happen: Vollard would show paintings of lesser quality still. Fi­
nally the buyers would realize they had better grab what he was showing
them, because tomorrow they would have to settle far something worse,
perhaps at even higher prices.
A variation on this technique is to raise the price every time the buyer
hesitates and another day goes by. This is an excellent negotiating ploy to
use on the chronically indecisive, who will fall for the idea that they are get­
ting a better deal today than if they wait till tomorrow.
The Weak Man on the Precipice. The weak are the easiest to maneuver
by controlling their options. Cardinal de Retz, the great seventeenth-cen­
tury provocateur, served as an unofficial assistant to the Duke of Orleans,
who was notoriously indecisive. It was a constant struggle to convince the
duke to take action-he would hem and haw, weigh the options, and wait
till the last moment, giving everyone around hirn an ulcer. But Retz discov­
ered a way to handle hirn: He would describe all sorts of dangers, exagger­
ating them as much as possible, until the duke saw a yawning abyss in
every direction except one: the one Retz was pushing hirn to take.
This tactic is similar to "Color the Choices," but with the weak you
have to be more aggressive. Work on their emotions-use fear and terror
to propel them into action. Try reason and they will always find a way to
procrastinate.
Brothers in Crime. This is a classic con-artist technique: You attract YOUf
victims to same criminal scheme, creating a bond of blood and guilt be­
tween you. They participate in your deception, commit a crime (or think
they do-see the story of Sam Geezil in Law 3), and are easily manipu­
lated. Serge Stavisky, the great French con artist of the 1920s, so entangled
the government in his scams and swindles that the state did not dare to
prosecute hirn, and "chose" to leave hirn alone. It is often wise to implicate
in your deceptions the very person who can do you the most harm if you
fail. Their involvement can be subtle--even a hint of their involvement
will narrow their options and buy their silence.
The Horns of a Dilemma. This idea was demonstrated by General
William Sherman's infamous march through Georgia during the American
Civil War. Although the Confederates knew what direction Sherman was
260 LAW 31

[PAGE 285]
heading in, they never knew if he would attack from the left or the right, for
he divided his army into two wings-a-- nd if the rebels retreated from one
wing they found themselves facing the other. This is a classic triallawyer's
technique: The lawyer leads the witnesses to decide between two possible
explanations of an event, both of which poke a hole in their story. They
have to answer the lawyer's questions, but whatever they say they hurt
themselves. The key to this move is to strike quickly: Deny the victim the
time to think of an escape. As they wriggle between the horns of the
dilemma, they dig their own grave.
Understand: In your struggles with your rivals, it will often be necessary
for you to hurt them. And if you are clearly the agent of their punishment,
expect a counterattack-expect revenge. If, however, they seem to them­
selves to be the agents of their own misfortune, they will submit quietly.
When Ivan left Moscow for his rural village, the citizens asking hirn to re­
turn agreed to his demand for absolute power. Over the years to come,
they resented hirn less for the terror he unleashed on the country, because,
after all, they had granted hirn his power themselves. This is why it is al­
ways good to allow your victims their choice of poison, and to cloak your
involvement in providing it to them as far as possible.

Authority: For the wounds and every other evil that men inflict upon them­
selves spontaneously, and of their own choice, are in the long run less
painful than those inflicted by others. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)
LAW 31 261

[PAGE 286]
REVERSAL
Controlling the options has one main purpose: to disguise yourself as the
agent of power and punishment. The tactic works best, then, for those
whose power is fragile, and who cannot operate too openly without incur­
ring suspicion, resentment, and anger. Even as a general rule, however, it is
rarely wise to be seen as exerting power directly and forcefully, no matter
how secure or strong you are. 1t is usually more elegant and more effective
to give people the illusion of choice.
On the other hand, by limiting other people's options you sometimes
limit your OWll. There are situations in which it is to your advantage to
allow your rivals a large degree of freedom: As you watch them operate,
you give yourself rich opportunities to spy, gather information, and plan
your deceptions. The nineteenth-century banker James Rothschild liked
this method: He feIt that if he tried to control his opponents' movements,
he lost the chance to observe their strategy and plan a more effective
course. The more freedom he allowed them in the short term, the more
forcefully he could act against them in the long run.

KEYS TO POWER
Fantasy can never operate alone. It requires the backdrop of the humdrum
and the mundane. It is the oppressiveness of reality that allows fantasy to
take root and bloom. In sixteenth-century Venice, the reality was one of de­
dine and loss of prestige. The corresponding fantasy described a sudden
recovery of past glories through the miracle of alchemy. While the reality
only got worse, the Venetians inhabited a happy dream world in which
their city restored its fabulous wealth and power ovemight, tuming dust
into gold.
The person who can spin a fantasy out of an oppressive reality has ac­
cess to untold power. As you search for the fantasy that will take hold of the
266 LAW 32

[PAGE 291]
masses, then, keep your eye on the banal truths that weigh heavily on us
all. Never be distracted by people's glamorous portraits of themselves and
their lives; search and dig far what really imprisons them. Once you find
that, you have the magical key that will put great power in your hands.
Although times and people change, let us examine a few of the oppres­
sive realities that endure, and the opportunities for power they provide:
TM Reality: Change is slow and gradual. It requires hard work, a bit o[ luck, a [air
amount o[selfsacrifice, and a lot p[patience.
The Fantasy: A sudden transformation will bring a total change in one's fortunes,
bypassing work, luck, selfsacrifice, and time in one [antastic stroke.
This is of course the fantasy par excellence of the charlatans who
prowl among us to this day, and was the key to Bragadino's success.
Promise a great and total change-from poor to rich, sickness to health,
misery to ecstasy-and you will have followers.
How did the great sixteenth-century German quack Leonhard
Thumeisser become the court physician for the Elector of Brandenburg
without ever studying medicine? Instead of offering amputations, leeches,
and foul-tasting purgatives (the medicaments of the time), Thumeisser of­
fered sweet-tasting elixirs and promised instant recovery. Fashionable
courtiers especially wanted his solution of "drinkable gold," which cost a
fortune. If so me inexplicable illness assailed you, Thumeisser would con­
sult a horoscope and prescribe a talisman. Who could resist such a
fantasy-health and well-being without sacrifice and pain!
The Reality: The social realm has hard-set codes and boundaries. We understand
these limits and know that we have to move within the same [amiliar circles, day in
and day out.
The Fantasy: We can enter a totally new world with difrfe ent codes and the promise
o[ adventure.
In the early 1700s, all London was abuzz with talk of a mysterious
stranger, a young man named George Psalmanazar. He had arrived from
what was to most Englishmen a fantastical land: the island of Formosa
(now Taiwan), off the coast of China. Oxford University engaged
Psalmanazar to teach the island's language; a few years later he translated
the Bible into Formosan, then wrote a book-an immediate best-seIler-on
Formosa's history and geography. English royalty wined and dined the
young man, and everywhere he went he entertained his hosts with won­
drous stories of his homeland, and its bizarre customs.
After Psalmanazar died, however, his will revealed that he was in fact
merely a Frenchman with a rich imagination. Everything he had said about
Formosa-its alphabet, its language, its literature, its entire culture-he had
invented. He had built on the English public's ignorance of the place to
concoct an elaborate story that fulfilled their desire for the exotic and
LAW 32 267

[PAGE 292]
strange. British culture's rigid control of people's dangerous dreams gave
hirn the perfect opportunity to exploit their fantasy.
The fantasy of the exotic, of course, can also skirt the sexual. It must
not come too elose, though, for the physical hinders the power of fantasy; it
can be seen, grasped, and then tired of-the fate of most courtesans. The
bodily charms of the mistress only whet the master's appetite for more and
different pleasures, a new beauty to adore. To bring power, fantasy must re­
main to some degree unrealized, literally unreal. The dancer Mata Hari,
for instance, who rose to public prominence in Paris before World War I,
had quite ordinary looks. Her power came from the fantasy she created of
being strange 'and exotic, unknowable and indedpherable, The taboo she
worked with was less sex itself than the breaking of sodal codes.
Another form of the fantasy of the exotic is simply the hope for relief
from boredom. Con artists love to play on the oppressiveness of the work­
ing world, its lack of adventure. Their cons might involve, say, the recov­
ery of lost Spanish treasure, with the possible partidpation of an alluring
Mexican seiiorita and a connection to the president of a South American
country-anything offering release from the humdrum.
The Reality: Society isf rag;mented andf oll of conflict.
The Fantasy: People can come together in a mystical union ofsouls.
In the 1920s the con man Oscar Hartzell made a quick fortune out of
the age-old Sir Frands Drake swindle-basically promising any sucker who
happened to be surnamed "Drake" a substantial share of the long-lost
"Drake treasure," to which Hartzell had access. Thousands across the Mid­
west fell for the scam, which Hartzell eleverly turned into a crusade against
the government and everyone else who was trying to keep the Drake for­
tune out of the rightful hands of its heirs. There developed a mystical union
of the oppressed Drakes, with emotional rallies and meetings. Promise such
a union and you can gain much power, but it is a dangerous power that can
easily turn against you. This is a fantasy for demagogues to play on.
The Reality: Death. The dead cannot be brought back, the past cannot be changed.
The Fantasy: A sudden reversal ofthis intolerable fact.
This con has many variations, but requires great skill and subtlety.
The beauty and importance of the art of Vermeer have long been rec­
ognized, but his paintings are small in number, and are extremely rare. In
the 1930s, though, Vermeers began to appear on the art market. Experts
were called on to verify them, and pronounced them real. Pos session of
these new Vermeers would crown a collector's career. It was like the resur­
rection of Lazarus: In a strange way, Vermeer had been brought back to
life. The past had been changed.
Only later did it come out that the new Vermeers were the work of a
middle-aged Dutch forger named Han van Meegeren. And he had chosen
268 LAW 32

[PAGE 293]
Vermeer for his scam because he understood fantasy: The paintings would
seem real precisely because the public, and the experts as weIl, so desper­
ately wanted to believe they were.
Remember: The key to fantasy is distance. The distant has allure and
promise, seems simple and problem free. What you are offering, then,
should be ungraspable. Never let it become oppressively familiar; it is the
mirage in the distance, withdrawing as the sucker approaches. Never be
too direct in describing the fantasy-keep it vague. As a forger of fantasies,
let your victim come elose enough to see and be tempted, but keep hirn far
away enough that he stays dreaming and desiring.

Authority: A lie is an allurement, a fabrication, that can be embell­
ished into a fantasy. It can be elothed in the raiments of a mystic
conception. Truth is cold, sober fact, not so comfortable to absorb.
A lie is more palatable. The most detested person in the world is
the one who always teIls the truth, who never romances. . . .
I found it far more interesting and profitable to romance than to
tell the truth. (Joseph Weil, a.k.a. "The Yellow Kid," 1875-1976)

REVERSAL
If there is power in tapping into the fantasies of the masses, there is also
danger. Fantasy usually contains an element of play-the public half real­
izes it is being duped, but it keeps the dream alive anyway, relishing the en­
tertainment and the temporary diversion from the everyday that you are
providing. So keep it light-never come too elose to the place where you
are actually expected to produce results. That place may prove extremely
hazardous.
After Bragadino established hirnself in Munieh, he found that the
sober-minded Bavarians had far less faith in alchemy than the tempera­
mental Venetians. Only the duke really believed in it, for he needed it des­
perately to rescue him from the hopeless mess he was in. As Bragadino
played his familiar waiting game, accepting gifts and expecting patience,
the public grew angry. Money was being spent and was yielding no results.
In 1592 the Bavarians demanded justice, and eventually Bragadino found
hirnself swinging from the gallows. As before, he had promised and had
not delivered, but this time he had misjudged the forbearance of his hosts,
and his inability to fulfill their fantasy proved fatal.
One last thing: Never make the mistake of imagining that fantasy is al­
ways fantastical. It certainly contrasts with reality, but reality itself is some­
times so theatrical and stylized that fantasy be comes a desire for simple
things. The image Abraham Lincoln created of hirnself, for example, as a
homespun country lawyer with a beard, made him the common man's
president.
P. T. Barnum created a successful act with Tom Thumb, a dwarf who
dressed up as famous leaders of the past, such as Napoleon, and lam­
pooned them wickedly. The show delighted everyone, right up to Queen
Victoria, by appealing to the fantasy of the time: Enough of the vain­
glorious rulers of history, the common man knows best. Tom Thumb re­
versed the familiar pattern of fantasy in which the strange and unknown
be comes the ideal. But the act still obeyed the Law, for underlying it
was the fantasy that the simple man is without problems, and is happier
than the powerful and the rich.
Both Lincoln and Tom Thumb played the commoner but carefully
maintained their distance. Should you play with such a fantasy, you too
must carefully cultivate distance and not allow your "common" persona to
become too familiar or it will not project as fantasy.

When the two men met, William, predictably, had been worked into a
tizzy by the queen. He reiterated his fear of being guillotined. But Bismarck
only replied, "Yes, then we shall be dead! We must die sooner or later, and
could there be a more respectable way of dying? I should die fighting for
the cause of my king and master. Your Majesty would die sealing with your
own blood your royal rights granted by God's grace. Whether upon the
scaffold or upon the battlefield makes no difference to the glorious staking
of body and life on behalf of rights granted by God's grace!" On he went,
appealing to William's sense of honor and the majesty of his position as
head of the army. How could the king allow people to push hirn around?
Wasn't the honor of Germany more important than quibbling over words?
Not only did the prime minister convince the king to stand up to both his
wife and his parliament, he persuaded hirn to build up the army-Bis­
marck's goal all along.
Interpretation

William had a military background and a deep sense of honor, and that he
feit ashamed at his cravenness before his wife and his government. William
secretly yearned to be a great and mighty king, but he dared not express
this ambition because he was afraid of ending up like Louis XVI. Where a
show of courage often conceals a man's timidity, William's timidity con­
cealed his need to show courage and thump his chest.
Bismarck sensed the longing for glory beneath William's pacifist front,
so he played to the king's insecurity about his manhood, finaHy pushing
hirn into three wars and the creation of a German empire. Timidity is a po­
tent weakness to exploit. Timid souls often yearn to be their opposite-to

In YOUf games of power you always look several steps ahead and plan

the areas over which they have least control, you can unleash emotions
that will upset YOUf plans. Push timid people into bold action and they may
go too far; answer their need for attention or recognition and they may
need more than you want to give them. The helpless, childish element you
are playing on can turn against you.
The more emotional the weakness, the greater the potential danger.
Know the limits to this game, then, and never get carried away by your

loved money and had amassed a huge fortune. 1601-1658
As the reign of the "bourgeois king" plodded on, people came to de­
spise hirn. The aristocracy could not endure the sight of an unkingly king,
and within a few years they tumed on hirn. Meanwhile the growing class of
the poor, including the radicals who had chased out Charles X, found no
satisfaction in a ruler who neither acted as a king nor govemed as a man of
the people. The bankers to whom Louis-Philippe was the most beholden
soon realized that it was they who controlled the country, not he, and they
treated hirn with growing contempt. One day, at the start of a train trip or­
ganized for the royal family, James Rothschild actually berated him-and
in public-for being late. Once the king had made news by treating the
banker as an equal; now the banker treated the king as an inferior.
Eventually the workers' insurrections that had brought down Louis­
Philippe's predecessor began to reemerge, and the king put them down
with force. But what was he defending so brutally? Not the institution ofthe
monarchy, which he disdained, nor a democratic republic, which his rule
prevented. What he was really defending, it seemed, was his own fortune,
and the fortunes of the bankers-not a way to inspire loyalty among the
citizenry.
In early 1848, Frenchmen of all classes began to demonstrate for elec­
toral reforms that would make the country truly democratic. By February
the demonstrations had tumed violent. To assuage the populace, Louis­
Philippe fired his prime minister and appointed a liberal as areplacement.
But this created the opposite of the desired effect: The people sensed they
could push the king around. The demonstrations tumed into a full-fledged
revolution, with gunfire and barricades in the streets.
LAW 34 283

[PAGE 308]
On the night of February 23, a crowd of Parisians surrounded the
palace. With a suddenness that caught everyone by surprise, Louis­
Philippe abdicated that very evening and fled to England. He left no suc­
cessor, nor even the suggestion of one--his whole government folded up
and dissolved like a traveling circus leaving town.
Interpretation
Louis-Philippe consciously dissolved the aura that naturally pertains to
kings and leaders. Scoffing at the symbolism of grandeur, he believed a
new world was dawning, where rulers should act and be like ordinary citi­
zens. He was right: A new world, without kings and queens, was certainly
on its way. He was profoundly wrong, however, in predicting a change in
the dynamics of power.
The bourgeois king's hat and umbrella amused the French at first, but
soon grew irritating. People knew that Louis-Philippe was not really like
them at all-that the hat and umbrella were essentially a kind of trick to en­
courage them in the fantasy that the country had suddenly grown more
equal. Actually, though, the divisions of wealth had never been greater.
The French expected their ruler to be a bit of a showman, to have some
presence. Even a radicallike Robespierre, who had briefly come to power
during the French Revolution fifty years earlier, had understood this, and
certainly Napoleon, who had turned the revolutionary republic into an im­
perial regime, had known it in his bones. Indeed as soon as Louis-Philippe
fled the stage, the French revealed their true desire: They elected
Napoleon's grand-nephew president. He was a virtual unknown, but they
hoped he would re-create the great general's powerful aura, erasing the
awkward memory of the "bourgeois king."
Powerful people may be tempted to affect a common-man aura, trying
to create the illusion that they and their subjects or underlings are basically
the same. But the people whom this false ge sture is intended to impress will
quickly see through it. They understand that they are not being given more
power-that it only appears as if they shared in the powerful person's fate.
The only kind of common touch that works is the kind affected by Franklin
Roosevelt, a style that said the president shared values and goals with the
common people even while he remained a patrician at heart. He never
pretended to erase his distance from the crowd.
Leaders who try to dissolve that distance through a false chumminess
gradually lose the ability to inspire loyalty, fear, or love. Instead they elicit
contempt. Like Louis-Philippe, they are too uninspiring even to be worth
the guillotine--the best they can do is simply vanish in the night, as if they
were never there.

to always act with dignity, no matter the circumstance. Louis-Philippe gave
no sense of being different from other people-he was the banker king.
And the moment his subjects threatened him, he caved in. Everyone
sensed this and pounced. Lacking regal dignity and firmness of purpose,
Louis-Philippe seemed an impostor, and the crown was easily toppled
from his head.
Regal bearing should not be confused with arrogance. Arrogance may
seem the king's entitlement, but in fact it betrays insecurity. It is the very
opposite of a royal demeanor.

Haile Selassie, mler ofE thiopia for forty or SO years beginning in 1930,
was once a young man named Lij Tafari. He came from a noble family, but
there was no real chance of hirn coming to power, for he was far down the
line of succession from the king then on the throne, Menelik 11. Neverthe­
less, from an early age he exhibited a self-confidence and a royal bearing
that surprised everyone around hirn.
At the age of fourteen, Tafari went to live at the court, where he imme­
diately impressed Menelik and became his favorite. Tafari's grace under
fire, his patience, and his calm self-assurance fascinated the king. The other
young nobles, arrogant, blustery, and envious, would push this slight,
bookish teenager around. But he never got angry-that would have been a
sign of insecurity, to which he would not stoop. There were already people
around hirn who feIt he would someday rise to the top, for he acted as ifhe
were already there.
Years later, in 1936, when the ltalian Fascists had taken over Ethiopia
and Tafari, now called Haile Selassie, was in exile, he addressed the League
of Nations to plead his country's case. The Italians in the audience heckled
hirn with vulgar abuse, but he maintained his dignified pose, as if corn­
. pletely unaffected. This elevated hirn while making his opponents look
even uglier. Dignity, in fact, is invariably the mask to assurne under difficult
circumstances: It is as if nothing can affect you, and you have all the time
in the world to respond. This is an extremely powerful pose.
A royal demeanor has other uses. Con artists have long known the
value of an aristocratic front; it either dis arms people and makes them less
suspicious, or else it intimidates them and puts them on the defensiv�and
as Count Victor Lustig knew, once you put a sucker on the defensive he is
doomed. The con man Yellow Kid Weil, too, would often assurne the trap­
pings of a man of wealth, along with the nonchalance that goes with thern.
Alluding to some magical method of making money, he would stand aloof,
like a king, exuding confidence as if he really were fabulously rich. The
suckers would beg to be in on the con, to have a chance at the wealth that
he so clearly displayed.
Finally, to reinforce the inner psychological tricks involved in project­
ing a royal demeanor, there are outward strategies to help you create the
effect. First, the Columbus Strategy: Always make a bold demand. Set your
price high and do not waver. Second, in a dignified way, go after the high­
est person in the building. This immediately puts you on the same plane as
the chief executive you are attacking. It is the David and Goliath Strategy:
By choosing a great opponent, you create the appearance of greatness.
Third, give a gift of some sort to those above you. This is the strategy
of those who have a patron: By giving your patron a gift, you are essentially
saying that the two of you are equal. It is the old con game of giving so that
you can take. When the Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino wanted the
Duke of Mantua as his next patron, he knew that if he was slavish and
sycophantic, the duke would think hirn unworthy; so he approached the
duke with gifts, in this case paintings by the writer's good friend Titian.
288 LAW 34

[PAGE 313]
Accepting the gifts created a kind of equality between duke and writer: The
duke was put at ease by the feeling that he was dealing with a man of his
own aristocratie stamp. He funded Aretino generously. The gift strategy is
subtle and brilliant beeause you do not beg: You ask for help in a dignified
way that implies equality between two people, one of whom just happens
to have more money.
Remember: It is up to you to set your own priee. Ask for less and that
is just what you will get. Ask for more, however, and you send a signal that
you are worth a king's ransom. Even those who turn you down respeet you
for your eonfidenee, and that respeet will eventually pay off in ways you
cannot imagine.
Image: The Crown. Plaee it upon your head
and you assume a different pose-tranquil
yet radiating assuranee. Never show
doubt, never lose your dignity beneath
the erown, or it will not fit. It will seem
to be destined for one more worthy. Do
not wait for a eoronation; the great­
est emperors crown themselves.
Authority: Everyone should be royal after his own fashion. Let all your
actions, even though they are not those of a king, be, in their own
sphere, worthy of one. Be sublime in your deeds, lofty in your
thoughts; and in all your doings show that you deserve to be a king
even though you are not one in reality. (Baltasar Graeiän, 1601-1658)
LAW 34 289

[PAGE 314]
REVERSAL
The idea behind the assumption of regal confidence is to set yourself apart
from other people, but if you take this too far it will be your undoing.
Never make the mistake of thinking that you elevate yourself by humiliat­
ing people. Also, it is never a good idea to 100m too high above the
crowd-you make an easy target. And there are times when an aristocratic
pose is eminently dangerous.
Charles I, king of England during the 1640s, faced a profound public
disenchantment with the institution of monarchy. Revolts erupted through­
out the country, led by Oliver Cromwell. Had Charles reacted to the times
with insight, supporting reforms and making a show of sacrificing some of
his power, history might have been different. Instead he reverted to an
even more regal pose, seeming outraged by the assault on his power and
on the divine institution of monarchy. His stiff kingliness offended people
and spurred on their revolts. And eventually Charles lost his head, literally.
Understand: You are radiating confidence, not arrogance or disdain.
Finally, it is true that you can sometimes find some power through af­
fecting a kind of earthy vulgarity, which will prove amusing by its extreme­
ness. But to the extent that you win this game by going beyond the limits,
separating yourself from other people by appearing even more vulgar than
they are, the game is dangerous: There will always be people more vulgar
than you, and you will easily be replaced the following season by someone
younger and worse.

Finally, slowing time down will give you a perspective on the times
you live in, letting you take a certain distance and putting you in a less
emotionally charged position to see the shapes of things to come. Hurriers
will often mistake surface phenomena for a real trend, seeing only what
they want to see. How much better to see what is really happening, even if
it is unpleasant or makes your task harder.
Forced Time. The trick in forcing time is to upset the timing of others-to
make them hurry, to make them wait, to make them abandon their own
pace, to distort their perception of time. Ey upsetting the timing of your op­
ponent while you stay patient, you open up time for yourself, which is half
the game.
In 1473 the great Turkish sultan Mehmed the Conqueror invited nego­
tiations with Hungary to end the off-and-on war the two countries had
waged for years. When the Hungarian emissary arrived in Turkey to start
the talks, Turkish officials humbly apologized-Mehmed had just left Istan­
bul, the capital, to battle his longtime foe, Uzun Hasan. Eut he urgently
wanted peace with Hungary, and had asked that the emissary join hirn at
the front.
When the emissary arrived at the site of the fighting, Mehmed had al­
ready left it, moving eastward in pursuit of his swift foe. This happened
several times. Wherever the emissary stopped, the Turks lavished gifts and
banquets on hirn, in pleasurable but time-consuming ceremonies. Finally
Mehmed defeated Uzun and met with the emissary. Yet his terms for peace
with Hungary were excessively harsh. Mter a few days, the negotiations
ended, and the usual stalemate remained in place. Eut this was fine with
Mehmed. In fact he had planned it that way all along: Plotting his cam­
paign against Uzun, he had seen that diverting his armies to the east would
leave his western flank vulnerable. To prevent Hungary from taking advan­
tage of his weakness and his preoccupation elsewhere, he first dangled the
lure of peace before his enemy, then made them wait-all on his own
terms.
Making people wait is a powerful way of forcing time, as long as they
do not figure out what you are up to. You control the dock, they linger in
limbo-and rapidly come unglued, opening up opportunities for you to
strike. The opposite effect is equally powerful: You make your opponents
hurry. Start off your dealings with them slowly, then suddenly apply pres­
sure, making them feel that everything is happening at once. People who

[PAGE 322]
This was the technique Machiavelli admired in Cesare Borgia, who, during
negotiations, would suddenly press vehemendy for a decision, upsetting
his opponent's timing and patience. For who would dare make Cesare
wait?
Joseph Duveen, the famous art dealer, knew that if he gave an indeci­
sive buyer like John D. Rockefeller a deadline-the painting had to leave
the country, another tycoon was interested in it-the dient would buy just
in time. Freud noticed that patients who had spent years in psychoanalysis
without improvement would miraculously recover just in time if he fixed a
definite date for the end of the therapy. Jacques Lacan, the farnaus French
psychoanalyst, used a variation on this tactic-he would sometimes end
the customary hour session of therapy after only ten minutes, without
waming. After this happened several times, the patient would realize that
he had better make maximum use of the time, rather than wasting much of
the hour with a lot of talk that meant nothing. The deadline, then, is a pow­
erful tool. Close off the vistas of indecision and force people to make up
their damn minds or get to the point-never let them make you play on
their excruciating terms. Never give them time.
Magicians and showmen are experts in forcing time. Houdini could
often wriggle free of handcuffs in minutes, but he would draw the escape
out to an hour, making the audience sweat, as time came to an apparent
standstill. Magicians have always known that the best way to alter our per­
ception of time is often to slow down the pace. Creating suspense brings
time to a terrifying pause: The slower the magician's hands move, the eas­
ier it is to create the illusion of speed, making people think the rabbit has
appeared instantaneously. The great nineteenth-century magicianJean-Eu­
gene Robert-Houdin took explicit notice of this effect: "The more slowlya
story is told," he said, "the shorter it seems."
Going slower also makes what you are doing more interesting-the
audience yields to your pace, becomes entranced. It is astate in which time
whizzes delightfully by. You must practice such illusions, which share in the
hypnotist's power to alter perceptions of time.
End Time. You can play the game with the utmost artistry-waiting pa­
tiendy for the right moment to act, putting your competitors off their form
by messing with their timing-but it won't mean a thing unless you know
how to finish. Da not be one of those people who look like paragons of pa­
tience but are actually just afraid to bring things to a dose: Patience is
worthless unless combined with a willingness to fall ruthlessly on your op­
ponent at the right moment. You can wait as long as necessary for the con­
dusion to come, but when it comes it must come quickly. Use speed to
paralyze your opponent, cover up any mistakes you might make, and im­
press people with your aura of authority and finality.
With the patience of a snake charmer, you draw the snake out with
calm and steady rhythms; Once the snake is out, though, would you dangle
your foot above its deadly head? There is never a good reason to allow the

slightest hitch in your endgame. Your mastery of timing can really only be
judged by how you work with end time-how you quickly change the pace
and bring things to a swift and definitive conclusion.

There is no power to be gained in letting go of the reins and adapting to

sisted that she had remained a virgin through her marriage to Arthur, and
Pope Clement VII supported her by giving his blessing to the union, which
he could not have done had he considered it incestuous. Yet after years of
marriage to Henry, Catherine had failed to produce a son, and in the early
1520s she had entered menopause. To the king this could only mean one
thing: She had lied about her virginity, their union was incestuous, and
God had punished them.
There was another reason why Henry wanted to get rid of Catherine:
He had fallen in love with a younger woman, Anne Boleyn. Not only was
he in love with her, but if he married her he could still hope to sire a legiti­
mate son. The marriage to Catherine had to be annulled. For this, how­
ever, Henry had to apply to the Vatican. But Pope Clement would never
annul the marriage.
By the summer of 1527, rumors spread throughout Europe that Henry
was about to attempt the impossible-to annul his marriage against
Clement's wishes. Catherine would never abdicate, let alone voluntarily
enter a nunnery, as Henry had urged her. But Henry had his own strategy:
He stopped sleeping in the same bed with Catherine, since he considered
her his sister-in-Iaw, not his lawful wife. He insisted on calling her Princess

The Japanese emperor Go-Saiin, a great disciple of the tea ceremony,
306 LAW 36

[PAGE 331]
owned a priceless antique tea bowl that all the courtiers envied. One day a
guest, Dainagon Tsunehiro, asked if he could carry the tea bowl into the
light, to examine it more closely. The bowl rarely left the table, but the em­
peror was in good spirits and he consented. As Dainagon carried the bowl
to the railing of the verandah, however, and held it up to the light, it
slipped from his hands and fell on a rock in the garden below, smashing
into tiny fragments.
The emperor of course was furious. "It was indeed most clumsy of me
to let it drop in this way," said Dainagon, with a deep bow, "but really
there is not much harm done. This Ido tea-bowl is a very old one and it is
impossible to say how much longer it would have lasted, but anyhow it is
not a thing of any public use, so I think it rather fortunate that it has broken
thus." This surprising response had an immediate effect: The emperor
calmed down. Dainagon neither sniveled nor overapologized, but signaled
his own worth and power by treating his mistake with a touch of disdain.
The emperor had to respond with a similar aristocratic indifference; his
anger had made hirn seem low and petty-an image Dainagon was able to
manipulate.
Among equals this tactic might backfire: Your indifference could make
you seem callous. Eut with a master, if you act quickly and without great
fuss, it can work to great effect: You bypass his angry response, save hirn
the time and energy he would waste by brooding over it, and allow hirn the
opportunity to display his own lack of pettiness publicly.
If we make excuses and denials when we are caught in amistake or a
deception, we stir the waters and make the situation worse. It is often wiser
to play things the opposite way. The Renaissance writer Pietro Aretino
often boasted of his aristocratic lineage, which was, of course, a fiction,
since he was actually the son of a shoemaker. When an enemy of his finally
revealed the embarrassing truth, word quickly spread, and soon all of
Venice (where he lived at the time) was aghast at Aretino's lies. Had he
tried to defend hirnself, he would have only dragged hirnself down. His re­
sponse was masterful: He announced that he was indeed the son of a shoe­
maker, but this only proved his greatness, since he had risen from the
lowest stratum of society to its very pinnacle. From then on he never men­
tioned his previous lie, trumpeting instead his new position on the matter
of his ancestry.
Remember: The powerful responses to niggling, petty annoyances and
irritations are contempt and disdain. Never show that something has af­
fected you, or that you are offended-that only shows you have acknowl­
edged a problem. Contempt is a dish that is best served cold and without

our perverse nature.) It also happens that words offend us, stirring up asso­
ciations unintended by the speaker.
The visual, on the other hand, short-circuits the labyrinth of words. It
strikes with an emotional power and immediacy that leave no gaps for re­
flection and doubt. Like music, it leaps right over rational, reasonable
thoughts. Imagine the Moon Doctor trying to make a case for his medical
practice, trying to convince the unconverted by telling them about the
healing powers of the moon, and about his owo special connection to a dis­
tant object in the sky. Fortunately for hirn, he was able to create a com­
pelling spectacle that made words unnecessary. The moment his patients
entered the beer hall, the image of the moon spoke eloquently enough.
Understand: Words put you on the defensive. If you have to explain
yourself your power is already in question. The image, on the other hand,
imposes itself as a given. It discourages questions, creates forcehll associa­
tions, resists unintended interpretations, communicates instantly, and
forges bonds that transcend social differences. Words stir up arguments
and divisions; images bring people together. They are the quintessential in­
struments of power.
The symbol has the same force, whether it is visual (the statue of
LAW 37 313

[PAGE 338]
Diana) or a verbal description of something visual (the words "the Sun
King"). The symbolic object stands for something else, something abstract
(such as the image "Diana" standing for chastity). The abstract concept­
purity, patriotism, courage, love-is full of emotional and powerful associa­
tions. The symbol is a shortcut of expression, containing dozens of
meanings in one simple phrase or object. The symbol of the Sun King, as
explained by Louis XIV, can be read on many layers, but the beauty of it is
that its associations required no explanation, spoke immediately to his sub­
jects, distinguished him from all other kings, and conjured up a kind of
majesty that went far beyond the words themselves. The symbol contains
untold power.
The first step in using symbols and images is to understand the pri­
macy of sight among the senses. Before the Renaissance, it has been ar­
gued, sight and the other senses-taste, touch, and so on-operated on a
relatively equal plane. Since then, however, the visual has come to domi­
nate the others, and is the sense we most depend on and trust. As Graciän
said, "The truth is generally seen, rarely heard." When the Renaissance
painter Fra Filippo Lippi was a captured slave among the Moors, he won
his freedom by sketching a drawing of his master on a white wall with a
piece of charcoal; when the owner saw the drawing, he instantly under­
stood the power of a man who could make such images, and let Fra Lippi
go. That one image was far more powerful than any argument the artist
could have made with words.
Never neglect the way you arrange things visually. Factors like color,
for example, have enormous symbolic resonance. When the con artist Yel­
low Kid Weil created a newsletter touting the phony stocks he was ped­
dling, he called it the "Red Letter Newsletter" and had it printed, at
considerable expense, in red ink. The color created a sense of urgency,
power, and good fortune. Weil recognized details like these as keys to de­
ception-as do modem advertisers and mass-marketers. If you use "gold"
in the title of anything you are trying to sell, for example, print it in gold.
. Since the eye predominates, people will respond more to the color than to
theword.
The visual contains great emotional power. The Roman emperor Con­
stantine worshipped the sun as a god for most of his life; one day, though,
he looked up at the sun, and saw a cross superimposed on it. The vision of
the cross over the sun proved to hirn the ascendancy of the new religion,
and he converted not just hirnself but the whole Roman Empire to Chris­
tianity soon thereafter. All the preaching and proselytizing in the world
could not have been as powerful. Find and associate yourself with the im­
ages and symbols that will communicate in this immediate way today, and
you will have untold power.
Most effective of all is a new combination-a fusion of images and sym­
bols that have not been seen together before, but that through their associ­
ation clearly demonstrate your new idea, message, religion. The creation of
new images and symbols out of old ones in this way has a poetic effect­
viewers' associations run rampant, giving them a sense of participation.
314 LAW 37

[PAGE 339]
Visual images often appear in a sequence, and the order in which they
appear creates a symbol. The first to appear, for instance, symbolizes
power; the image at the center seems to have central importance.
Near the end of World War 11, orders came down from General Eisen­
hower that American troops were to lead the way into Paris after its liber­
ation from the Nazis. The French general Charles de Gaulle, however,
realized that this sequence would imply that the Americans now com­
manded the fate of France. Through much manipulation, de Gaulle made
certain that he and the French Second Armored Division would appear at
the head of the liberating force. The strategy worked: After he had success­
fuHy pulled off this stunt, the Allies started treating hirn as the new leader
of an independent France. De Gaulle knew that aleader has to locate him­
self literally at the head of his troops. This visual association is crucial to the
emotional response that he needs to elicit.
Things change in the game of symbols: It is probably no longer possi­
ble to pose as a "sun king," or to wrap the mantIe of Diana around you. Yet
you can associate yourself with such symbols more indirectIy. And, of
course, you can make your own mythology out of figures from more re­
cent history, people who are comfortably dead but still powerfully associa­
tive in the public eye. The idea is to give yourself an aura, a stature that
your normal banal appearance simply will not create. By herself Diane de
Poitiers had no such radiant powers; she was as human and ordinary as
most of uso But the symbol elevated her above the human lot, and made
her seem divine.
Using symbols also has a courtier-like effect, since they are often gen­
tIer than brutish words. The psychotherapist Dr. Milton H. Erickson al­
ways tried to find symbols and images that would communicate to the
patient in ways that words could not. When dealing with a severely trou­
bied patient, he would not question hirn directIy but would talk about
something irrelevant, such as driving through the desert in Arizona, where
he practiced in the 1950s. In describing this he would eventually come to
an appropriate symbol for what he suspected was the man's problem. Ifhe
feIt the patient was isolated, say, Dr. Erickson would talk of a single iron­
wood tree, and how its isolation left it battered by the winds. Making an
emotional connection with the tree as a symbol, the patient would open up
more readily to the doctor's probing.
Use the power of symbols as a way to rally, animate, and unite your
troops or team. During the rebellion against the French crown in 1648,
those loyal to the king disparaged the rebels by comparing them to the
slingshots (in French,frondes) that littIe boys use to frighten big boys. Cardi­
nal de Retz decided to turn this disparaging term into the rebels' symbol:
The uprising was now known as the Fronde, and the rebels as frondeurs.
They began to wear sashes in their hats that symbolized the slingshot, and
the word became their rallying cry. Without it the rebellion might weIl
have petered out. Always find a symbol to represent your cause-the more
emotional associations, the better.
The best way to use images and symbols is to organize them into a

cism of the Spartans, he found hirnself enthralled by the Persian love of
luxury and sensual pleasure. He put on Persian robes and perfumes with a
sense of deliverance from Greek discipline and simplicity.

for those who do not share their desires. Indeed their need to show their
difference so dramatically often makes them disliked by the people whose
beliefs they challenge, indirectly and subtly, perhaps, but offensively
nonetheless.

KEYS TO POWER
We all tell lies and hide our true feelings, for complete free expression is a
sodal impossibility. From an early age we leam to conceal our thoughts,
telling the prickly and insecure what we know they want to hear, watching
carefully lest we offend them. For most of us this is natural-there are ideas
and values that most people accept, and it is pointless to argue. We believe
what we want to, then, but on the outside we wear a mask.
There are people, however, who see such restraints as an intolerable
infringement on their freedom, and who have a need to prove the superi-

three hundred years, the Spanish noticed a phenomenon that disturbed
them: Many of the converts lived their outward lives as Catholics, yet
somehow managed to retain their Jewish beliefs, practicing the religion in
private. Many of these so-called Marranos (originally a derogatory term,
being the Spanish for "pig") attained high levels of govemment office, mar­

VOLTAIRE,
In society, the Marranos knew, outward appearances are what matter.
1694-1778
This remains true today. The strategy is simple: As Campanella did in writ­
ing Atheism Conquered, make a show of bIen ding in, even going so far as to
be the most zealous advocate of the prevailing orthodoxy. If you stick to
conventional appearances in public few will believe you think differently
in private.
Do not be so foolish as to imagine that in our own time the old ortho­
doxies are gone. Jonas Salk, for instance, thought science had gotten past
politics and protocol. And so, in his search for a polio vaccine, he broke all
the rules-going public with a discovery before showing it to the scientific
community, taking credit for the vaccine without acknowledging the scien­
tists who had paved the way, making hirnself a star. The public may have
loved hirn but scientists shunned hirn. His disrespect for his community's
orthodoxies left hirn isolated, and he wasted years trying to heal the
breach, and struggling for funding and cooperation.
Bertolt Brecht underwent a modem form of Inquisition-the House
322 LAW 38

[PAGE 347]
Un-American Activities Committee-and approached it with considerable
canniness. Having worked off and on in the American film industry during
World War 11, in 1947 Brecht was summoned to appear before the commit­
tee to answer questions on his suspected Communist sympathies. Other
writers called before the committee made a point of attacking its members,
and of acting as belligerently as possible in order to gain sympathy for
themselves. Brecht, on the other hand, who had actually worked stead-
. fastly for the Communist cause, played the opposite game: He answered
questions with ambiguous generalities that defied easy interpretation. Call
it the Campanella strategy. Brecht even wore a suit-a rare event for him­
and made a point of smoking a cigar during the proceedings, knowing that
a key committee member had a passion for cigars. In the end he charmed
the committee members, who let hirn go scot-free.
Brecht then moved to East Germany, where he encountered a differ­
ent kind of Inquisition. Here the Communists were in power, and they crit­
icized his plays as decadent and pessimistic. He did not argue with them,
but made small changes in the performance scripts to shut them up. Mean­
while he managed to preserve the published texts as written. His outward
conformity in both cases gave hirn the freedom to work unhindered, with­
out having to change his thinking. In the end, he made his way safely
through dangerous times in different countries through the use of little
dances of orthodoxy, and proved he was more powerful than the forces of
repression.
Not only do people of power avoid the offenses of Pausanias and Salk,
they also leam to play the clever fox and feign the common touch. This has
been the ploy of con artists and politicians throughout the centuries. Lead­
ers like Julius Caesar and Franklin D. Roosevelt have overcome their nat­
ural aristocratic stance to cultivate a familiarity with the common man.
They have expressed this familiarity in little gestures, often symbolic, to
show the people that their leaders share popular values, despite their differ­
ent status.
The logical extension of this practice is the invaluable ability to be all
things to all people. When you go into society, leave behind your own
ideas and values, and put on the mask that is most appropriate for the
group in which you find yourself. Bismarck played this game successfully
for years-there were people who vaguely understood what he was up to,
but not clearly enough that it mattered. People will swallow the bait be­
cause it flatters them to believe that you share their ideas. They will not
take you as a hypocrite if you are careful-for how can they accuse you of
hypocrisy ifyou do not let them know exactly what you stand for? Nor will
they see you as lacking in values. Of course you have values-the values
you share with them, while in their company.
Authority: Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw
your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under
foot and turn to attack you. Oesus Christ, Matthew 7:6)

The only time it is worth standing out is when you already stand out­
when you ha�e achieved an unshakable position of power, and can display
YOUf difference from others as a sign of the distance between you. As pres­
ident of the United States, Lyndon Johnson would sometimes hold meet­
ings while he sat on the toilet. Since no one else either could or would
claim such a "privilege," Johnson was showing people that he did not have
to observe the protocols and niceties of others. The Roman emperor
Caligula played the same game: He would wear a woman's negligee, or a
bathrobe, to receive important visitors. He even went so far as to have his
horse elected consul. But it backfired, for the people hated Caligula, and
his gestures eventually brought his overthrow. The truth is that even those
who attain the heights of power would be better off at least affecting the
common touch, for at some point they may need popular support.
Finally, there is always a place for the gadfly, the person who success­
fuHy defies custom and mocks what has grown lifeless in a culture. Oscar
Wilde, for example, achieved considerable social power on this founda­

The answer, however, is not to repress our angry or emotional re­
sponses. For repression drains us of energy and pushes us into strange be­
havior. Instead we have to change our perspective: We have to realize that
nothing in the sodal realm, and in the game of power, is personal.
Everyone is caught up in achain of events that long predates the pre­
sent moment. Our anger often sterns from problems in our childhood,
from the problems of our parents which stern from their own childhood, on
and on. Our anger also has roots in the many interactions with others, the
accumulated disappointments and heartaches that we have suffered. An in­

volves dozens of prior hurts, and is actually not worth the bother to
understand. Instead of seeing it as a personal grudge, look at the emotional
outburst as a disguised power move, an attempt to control or punish you
cloaked in the form of hurt feelings and anger.
This shift of perspective will let you play the game of power with more
clarity and energy. Instead of overreacting, and becoming ensnared in peo-
LAW 39 329

[PAGE 354]
ple's emotions, you will turn their loss of control to your advantage: You
keep your head while they are losing theirs.
During an important batde in the War of the Three Kingdoms, in the
third century A.D., advisers to the commander Ts'ao Ts'ao discovered docu­
ments showing that certain of his generals had conspired with the enemy,
and urged hirn to arrest and execute them. Instead he ordered the docu­
ments bumed and the matter forgotten. At this critical moment in the bat­
de, to get upset or demand justice would have reverberated against hirn:
An angry action would have called attention to the generals' disloyalty,
which would have harmed the troops' morale. Justice could wait-he
would deal with the generals in time. Ts'ao Ts'ao kept his head and made
the right decision.
Compare this to Napoleon's response to Talleyrand: Instead of taking
the conspiracy personally, the emperor should have played the game like
Ts'ao Ts'ao, carefully weighing the consequences of any action he took.
The more powerful response in the end would have been to ignore Tal­
leyrand, or to bring the minister gradually back to his side and punish him
later.
Anger only cuts off our options, and the powerful cannot thrive with­
out options. Once you train yourself not to take matters personally, and to
control your emotional responses, you will have placed yourself in a posi­
tion of tremendous power: Now you can play with the emotional responses
of other people. Stir the insecure into action by impugning their manhood,
and by dangling the prospect of an easy victory before their faces. Do as
Houdini did when challenged by the less successful escape artist Kleppini:
Reveal an apparent weakness (Houdini let Kleppini steal the combination
for a pair of cuffs) to lure your opponent into action. Then you can beat
hirn with ease. With the arrogant too you can appear weaker than you are,
taunting them into a rash action.
Sun Pin, commander of the armies of Ch'i and loyal disciple of Sun­
tzu, once led his troops against the armies of Wei, which outnumbered hirn
two to one. "Let us light a hundred thousand fires when our army enters
Wei," suggested Sun Pin, "fifty thousand on the next day, and only thirty
thousand on the third." On the third day the Wei general exclaimed, "I
knew the men of Ch'i were cowards, and after only three days more than
half of them have deserted!" So, leaving behind his slow-moving heavy in­
fantry, the general decided to seize the moment and move swiftly on the
Ch'i camp with a lighdy armed force. Sun Pin's troops retreated, luring
Wei's army into a narrow pass, where they ambushed and destroyed them.
With the Wei general dead and his forces decimated, Sun Pin now easily
defeated the rest of his army.
In the face of a hot-headed enemy, finally, an excellent response is no
response. Follow the Talleyrand tactic: Nothing is as infuriating as a man
who keeps his cool while others are losing theirs. If it will work to your ad­
vantage to unsettle people, affect the aristocratic, bored pose, neither
mocking nor triumphant but simply indifferent. This will light their fuse.

When they embarrass themselves with a temper tantrum, you will have
gained several victories, one of these being that in the face of their childish­
ness you have maintained your dignity and composure.

Stir the waters and they emerge. Stir it som e more and they get
angry, rising to the surface, biting whatever comes near­
including a freshly baited hook.
Authority: If your opponent is of a hot temper, try to irritate hirn. If he
is arrogant, try to encourage his egotism. . . . One who is skilled at
making the enemy move does so by creating a situation according to
which the enemy will act; he entices the enemy with something he is
certain to take. He keeps the enemy on the move by holding out bait
and then attacks hirn with picked troops. (Sun-tzu, fourth century B.C.)
REVERSAL
When playing with people's emotions you have to be careful. Study the
enemy beforehand: Some fish are best left at the bottom of the pond.
The leaders of the city of Tyre, capital of ancient Phoenicia, feIt confi­
dent they could withstand Alexander the Great, who had conquered the
Orient but had not attacked their city, which stood weIl protected on the
water. They sent ambassadors to Alexander saying that although they
would recognize hirn as emperor they would not allow hirn or his forces to
enter Tyre. This of course enraged hirn, and he immediately mounted a
siege. For four months the city withstood hirn, and finally he decided that
the struggle was not worth it, and that he would come to tenns with the
Tyrians. But they, feeling that they had already baited Alexander and got­
ten away with it, and confident that they could withstand hirn, refused to

This pushed Alexander over the edge. Now it did not matter to him
how long the siege lasted or how large an army it needed; he had the re­
sources, and would do whatever it took. He remounted his assault so stren­
uously that he captured Tyre within days, burned it to the ground, and sold
its people into slavery.
You can bait the powerful and get them to commit and divide their
forces as Sun Pin did, but test the waters first. Find the gap in their strength.
If there is no gap-if they are impossibly strong-you have nothing to gain
and everything to lose by provoking them. Choose carefully whom you
bait, and never stir up the sharks.
Finally there are times when a well-timed burst of anger can do you
good, but your anger must be manufactured and under your control. Then
you can determine exactly how and on whom it will fall. Never stir up re­
actions that will work against you in the long fUll. And use your thunder­
bolts rarely, to make them the more intimidating and meaningful. Whether
purposefully staged or not, if your outbursts come too often, they will lose
their power.

On the other hand, this Law offers great opportunities for swindling
and deception if you apply it from the other side. Dangling the lure of a
free lunch is the con artist's stock in trade.
No man was better at this than the most successful con artist of our
age, Joseph Weil, a.k.a. "The Yellow Kid." The Yellow Kid leamed early
that what made his swindles possible was his fellow humans' greed. "This
desire to get something for nOthing," he once wrote, "has been very costly
to many people who have dealt with me and with other con men. . . .
When people leam-as I doubt they will-that they can't get something
for nOthing, crime will diminish and we shall all live in greater harmony."
Over the years Weil devised many ways to seduce people with the prospect
of easy money. He would hand out "free" real estate-who could resist
such an offer?-and then the suckers would leam they had to pay $25 to
register the sale. Since the land was free, it seemed worth the high fee, and
the Yellow Kid would make thousands of dollars on the phony registration.
In exchange he would give his suckers a phony deed. Other times, he
would tell suckers about a fixed horse race, or a stock that would eam 200
percent in a few weeks. As he spun his stories he would watch the sucker's
eyes open wide at the thought of a free lunch.

rather than to work for it. For a small sum, seIl them advice on how to
make millions (P. T. Bamum did this later in life), and that small sum will
become a fortune when multiplied by thousands of suckers. Lure people in
with the prospect of easy money and you have the room to work still more
deceptions on them, since greed is powerful enough to blind your victims
to anything. And as the Yellow Kid said, half the fun is teaching a moral
lesson: Greed does not pay.

Alexander the Great had a dominant passion as a young man-an intense

and his love of wrestling and of other wastes of time. Alexander knew he

name. To deal with this situation you need to hunt out the vacuums-those
LAW 41 353

[PAGE 378]
areas in culture that have been left vacant and in which you can become
the first and principal figure to shine.
When Pericles of Athens was about to launch a career as astatesman,
he looked for the one thing that was missing in Athenian politics. Most of
the great politicians of his time had allied themselves with the aristocracy;
indeed Pericles himself had aristocratic tendencies. Yet he decided to throw
in his hat with the city's democratic elements. The choice had nothing to
do with his personal beliefs, but it launched him on a brilliant career. Out
of necessity he became a man of the people. Instead of competing in an
arena filled with great leaders both past and present, he would make a
name for himself where no shadows could obscure his presence.
When the painter Diego de Veläzquez began his career, he knew he
could not compete in refinement and technique with the great Renaissance
painters who had come before him. Instead he chose to work in a style that
by the standards of the time seemed coarse and rough, in a way that had
never been seen before. And in this style he excelled. There were mem­
bers of the Spanish court who wanted to demonstrate their own break with
the past; the newness of Veläzquez's style thrilled them. Most people are
afraid to break so boldly with tradition, but they secretly admire those who
can break up the old forms and reinvigorate the culture. This is why there
is so much power to be gained from entering vacuums and voids.
There is a kind of stubbom stupidity that recurs throughout history,
and is a strong impediment to power: The superstitious belief that if the
person before you succeeded by doing A, B, and C, you can re-create their
success by doing the same thing. This cookie-cutter approach will seduce
the uncreative, for it is easy, and appeals to their timidity and their laziness.
But circumstances never repeat themselves exactly.
When General Douglas MacArthur assumed command of American
forces in the Philippines during World War II, an assistant handed him a
book containing the various precedents established by the commanders
before hirn, the methods that had been successful for them. MacArthur
asked the assistant how many copies there were of this book. Six, the assis­
tant answered. "WeIl," the general replied, "you get all those six copies to­
gether and bum them-every one of them. I'll not be . bound by
precedents. Any time a problem comes up, I'll make the decision at
once-immediately." Adopt this ruthless strategy toward the past: Bum all
the books, and train yourself to react to circumstances as they happen.
You may believe that you have separated yourself from the predeces­
sor or father figure, but as you grow older you must be etemally vigilant
lest you become the father you had rebelIed against. As a young man, Mao
Tse-tung disliked his father and in the struggle against hirn found his own
identity and a new set of values. But as he aged, his father's ways crept back
in. Mao's father had valued manual work over intellect; Mao had scoffed at
this as a young man, but as he grew older he unconsciously retumed to his
father's views and echoed such outdated ideas by forcing a whole genera­
tion of Chinese intellectuals into manual labor, a nightrnarish mistake that
354 LAW 41

[PAGE 379]
cost his regime dearly. Remember: You are your own father. Do not let
yourself spend years creating yourself only to let your guard down and
allow the ghost of the past-father, habit, history-to sneak back in.
Finally, as noted in the story of Louis XV, plenitude and prosperity
tend to make us lazy and inactive: When our power is secure we have no
need to act. This is a serious danger, especially for those who achieve suc­
cess and power at an early age. The playwright Tennessee Williarns, for in­
stance, found hirnself skyrocketed from obscurity to farne by the success of
The Glass Menagerie. "The sort of life which I had had previous to this popu­
lar success," he later wrote, "was one that required endurance, a life of
clawing and scratching, but it was a good life because it was the sort of life
for which the human organism is created. I was not aware of how much
vital energy had gone into this struggle until the struggle was removed.
This was security at last. I sat down and looked about me and was suddenly
very depressed." Williarns had a nervous breakdown, which may in fact
have been necessary for hirn: Pushed to the psychological edge, he could
start writing with the old vitality again, and he produced A Streetcar Named
Desire. Fyodor Dostoyevsky, similarly, whenever he wrote a successful
novel, would feel that the financial security he had gained made the act of

It is not necessary to go to such extremes, but you must be prepared to
return to square one psychologically rather than growing fat and lazy with
prosperity. Pablo Picasso could deal with success, but only by constantly
changing the style of his painting, often breaking completely with what
had made hirn successful before. How often our early triumphs turn us
into a kind of caricature of ourselves. Powerful people recognize these
traps; like Alexander the Great, they struggle constantly to re-create them­
selves. The father must not be allowed to return; he must be slain at every
step of the way.

The shadow of a great predecessor could be used to advantage if it is cho­
sen as a trick, a tactic that can be discarded once it has brought you power.
Napoleon III used the name and legend of his illustrious grand-unde
Napoleon Bonaparte to help hirn become first president and then emperor
of France. Once on the throne, however, he did not stay tied to the past; he
quickly showed how different his reign would be, and was careful to keep
the public from expecting hirn to attain the heights that Bonaparte had at­
tained.
The past often has elements worth appropriating, qualities that would
be foolish to reject out of a need to distinguish yourself. Even Alexander
the Great recognized and was influenced by his father's skill in organizing
an army. Making a display of doing things differently from your predeces­
sor can make you seem childish and in fact out of control, unless your ac­
tions have a logic of their OWll.
Joseph 11, son of the Austrian empress Maria Theresa, made a show of
doing the exact opposite of his mother-dressing like an ordinary citizen,
staying in inns instead of palaces, appearing as the "people's emperor."
Maria Theresa, on the other hand, had been regal and aristocratic. The
problem was that she had also been beloved, an empress who mIed wisely

after years of learning the hard way. If you have the kind of intelligence
and instinct that will point you in the right direction, playing the rebel will
not be dangerous. But if you are mediocre, as Joseph II was in comparison
to his mother, you are better off leaming from your predecessor's knowl­
edge and experience, which are based on something real.
Finally, it is often wise to keep an eye on the young, YOUf future rivals
in power. Just as you try to rid yourself of your father, they will soon play
the same trick on you, denigrating everything you have accomplished. Just
as you rise by rebelling against the past, keep an eye on those rising from
below, and never give them the chance to do the same to you.
The great Baroque artist and architect Pietro Bemini was a master at
sniffing out younger potential rivals and keeping them in his shadow. One
day a young stonemason named Francesco Borromini showed Bemini his
architectural sketches. Recognizing his talent immediately, Bemini in­
stantly hired Borromini as his assistant, which delighted the young man but
was actually only a tactic to keep him elose at hand, so that he could play
psychological games on him and create in hirn a kind of inferiority com­
plex. And indeed, despite Borromini's brilliance, Bemini has the greater
farne. His strategy with Borromini he made a lifelong practice: Fearing that
the great sculptor Alessandro Algardi, for example, would eelipse hirn in
farne, he arranged it so that Algardi could only find work as his assistant.
And any assistant who rebelled against Bemini and tried to strike out on
his own would find his career ruined.

ambition at the expense of the common good; the flaunting of superiority;

eat away at the city's cohesion by creating factions and sowing dissension,
others would ruin the democratic spirit by making the common citizen

Florence was divided by two riyal factions, the Blacks and the Whites. AESOP,
SIXTH CENTURY B.C.
The Whites were the merchant families that had recently and quickly
risen to power and wealth; the Blacks were the older money. Because of
their popularity with the people, the Whites retained control of the city, to
the Blacks' increasing resentment. The feud between the two grew steadily
more bitter.
Here Boniface saw his chance: He would plot to help the Blacks take
over the city, and Florence would be in his pocket. And as he studied the
situation he began to focus on one man, Dante Alighieri, the celebrated
writer, poet, and ardent supporter of the Whites. Dante had always been
interested in politics. He believed passionately in the republic, and often
chastised his fellow citizens for their lack of spine. He also happened to be
the city's most eloquent public speaker. In 1300, the year Boniface began
plotting to take over Tuscany, Dante's fellow citizens had voted him in to
Florence's highest elected position, making hirn one of the city's six pri­
ors. During his six-month term in the post, he had stood firmly against the
Blacks and against all of the pope's attempts to sow disorder.
By 1301, however, Boniface had a new plan: He called in Charles de
Valois, powerful brother of the king of France, to help bring order to Tus­
cany. As Charles marched through northern Italy, and Florence seethed
with anxiety and fear, Dante quickly emerged as the man who could rally

yond cure.
KEYS TO POWER
In the past, an entire nation would be ruled by a king and his handful of
ministers. Only the elite had any power to play with. Over the centuries,
power has gradually become more and more diffused and democratized.
This has created, however, a common misperception that groups no
longer have centers of power-that power is spread out and scattered
among many people. Actually, however, power has changed in its num­
bers but not in its essence. There may be fewer mighty tyrants command­
ing the power of life and death over millions, but there remain thousands
of petty tyrants ruling smaller realms, and enforcing their will through in­
direct power games, charisma, and so on. In every group, power is con­
centrated in the hands of one or two people, for this is one area in which
human nature will never change: People will congregate around a single
strong personality like planets orbiting a sun.
To labor under the illusion that this kind of power center no longer
exists is to make endless mistakes, waste energy and time, and never hit
the target. Powerful people never waste time. Outwardly they may play
along with the game-pretending that power is shared among many-but
inwardly they keep their eyes on the inevitable few in the group who hold
the cards. These are the ones they work on. When troubles arise, they
look for the underlying cause, the single strong character who started the
stirring and whose isolation or banishment will settle the waters again.
In his family-therapy practice, Dr. Milton H. Erickson found that if
the family dynamic was unsetded and dysfunctional there was inevitably
one person who was the stirrer, the troublemaker. In his sessions he would
symbolically isolate this rotten apple by seating hirn or her apart from the
others, if only by a few feet. Slowly the other family members would see
the physically separate person as the source of their difficulty. Once you
recognize who the stirrer is, pointing it out to other people will accomplish
a great deal. Understanding who controls the group dynamic is a critical
realization. Remember: Stirrers thrive by hiding in the group, disguising
their actions among the reactions of others. Render their actions visible
and they lose their power to upset.
A key element in games of strategy is isolating the enemy's power. In
chess you try to corner the king. In the Chinese game of go you try to iso­
late the enemy's forces in small pockets, rendering them immobile and in­
effectual. It is often better to isolate your enemies than to destroy
LAW 42 363

[PAGE 388]
them-you seem less brutal. The result, though, is the same, for in the
game of power, isolation spells death.
The most effective form of isolation is somehow to separate your vic­
tims from their power base. When Mao Tse-tung wanted to eliminate an
enemy in the ruling elite, he did not confront the person directly; he
silently and stealthily worked to isolate the man, divide his allies and turn
them away from hirn, shrink his support. Soon the man would vanish on
his own.
Presence and appearance have great import in the game of power. To
seduce, particularly in the beginning stages, you need to be constantly
present, or create the feeling that you are; if you are often out of sight, the
charm will wear off. Queen Elizabeth's prime minister, Robert Cecil,
had two main rivals: the queen's favorite, the Earl of Essex, and her for­
mer favorite, Sir Walter Raleigh. He contrived to send them both on a
mission against Spain; with them away from the court he managed to
wrap his tentacles around the queen, seeure his position as her top ad­
viser and weaken her affection for Raleigh and the earl. The lesson here
is twofold: First, your absence from the court spells danger for you, and
you should never leave the scene in a time of turmoil, for your absence
can both symbolize and induce a loss of power; second, and on the other
hand, luring your enemies away from the court at critical moments is a
great ploy.
Isolation has other strategie uses. When trying to seduce people, it is
often wise to isolate them from their usual social context. Once isolated
they are vulnerable to you, and your presence becomes magnified. Simi­
larly, con artists often look for ways to isolate their marks from their nor­
mal social milieux, steering them into new environments in which they
are no longer comfortable. Here they feel weak, and succumb to decep­
tion more easily. Isolation, then, can prove a powernd way of bringing
people under your spell to seduce or swindle them.
You will often find powerful people who have alienated themselves
from the group. Perhaps their power has gone to their heads, and they
consider themselves superior; perhaps they have lost the knack of com­
municating with ordinary folk. Remember: This makes them vulnerable.
Powernd though they be, people like this can be tumed to use.
The monk Rasputin gained his power over Czar Nicholas and Czar­
ina Alexandra of Russia through their tremendous isolation from the peo­
pIe. Alexandra in particular was a foreigner, and especially alienated
from everyday Russians; Rasputin used his peasant origins to insinuate
hirnself into her good graces, for she desperately wanted to communicate
with her subjects. Once in the court's inner circle, Rasputin made hirnself
indispensable and attained great power. Heading straight for the center,
he aimed for the one figure in Russia who commanded power (the czarina
dominated her husband), and found he had no need to isolate her for the
work was already done. The Rasputin strategy can bring you great power:

selves isolated on the board. They are like apples falling into your lap,
easily seduced, and able to catapult you into power yourself.
Finally, the reason you strike at the shepherd is because such an ac­
tion will dishearten the sheep beyond any rational measure. When Her­
nando Cortes and Francisco Pizarro led their tiny forces against the Aztec
and Incan empires, they did not make the mistake of fighting on several
fronts, nor were they intimidated by the numbers arrayed against them;
they captured the kings, Moctezuma and Atahualpa. Vast empires fell
into their hands. With the leader gone the center of gravity is gone; there
is nothing to revolve around and everything falls apart. Aim at the lead­
ers, bring them down, and look for the endless opportunities in the confu­
sion that will ensue.

REVERSAL
"Any harm you do to a man should be done in such a way that you need
not fear his revenge," writes Machiavelli. If you act to isolate your enemy,
make sure he lacks the me ans to repay the favor. If you apply this Law, in
other words, apply it from a position of superiority, so that you have noth­
ing to fear from his resentment.
Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln's successor as V.S. president,
saw Ulysses S. Grant as a troublesome member of his govemment. So he
isolated Grant, as a prelude to forcing him out. This only enraged the
great general, however, who responded by forming a support base in the
Republican party and going on to become the next president. It would
have been far wiser to keep a man like Grant in the fold, where he could
do less harm, than to make him revengeful. And so you may often find it
better to keep people on your side, where you can watch them, than to
risk creating an angry enemy. Keeping them dose, you can secredy whit­
de away at their support base, so that when the time comes to cut them
loose they will fall fast and hard without knowing what hit them.

c. A. D. 46-1 20 KEYS TO POWER
In the game of power, you are surrounded by people who have absolutely
no reason to help you unless it is in their interest to do so. And if you have
nothing to offer their self-interest, you are likely to make them hostile, for
they will see in you just one more competitor, one more waster of their
time. Those that overcome this prevailing coldness are the ones who find
the key that unlocks the stranger's heart and mind, seducing hirn into their
corner, if necessary softening hirn up for a punch. But most people never
leam this side of the game. When they meet someone new, rather than
stepping back and probing to see what makes this person unique, they talk
about themselves, eager to irnpose their own willpower and prejudices.
They argue, boast, and make a show of their power. They may not know it
but they are secretly creating an enemy, a resister, because there is no
more infuriating feeling than having your individuality ignored, your own
psychology unacknowledged. It makes you feellifeless and resentful.
Remember: The key to persuasion is softening people up and break­
ing them down, gently. Seduce them with a two-pronged approach: Work
on their emotions and play on their intellectual weaknesses. Be alert to
both what separates them from everyone else (their individual psychology)
and what they share with everyone else (their basic emotional responses).
Aim at the primary emotions-Iove, hate, jealousy. Once you move their
emotions you have reduced their control, making them more vulnerable to
persuasion.
When Chuko Liang wanted to dissuade an important general of a rival
kingdom from entering into an alliance with Ts'ao Ts'ao, Liang's dreaded
enemy, he did not detail Ts'ao Ts'ao's cruelty, or attack him on moral
grounds. Instead Liang suggested that Ts'ao Ts'ao was really after the gen-
372 LAW 43

[PAGE 397]
eral's beautiful young wife. This hit the general in the gut, and won hirn
over. Mao Tse-tung similarly always appealed to popular emotions, and
spoke in the simplest terms. Educated and well-read hirnself, in his
speeches he used visceral metaphors, voicing the public's deepest anxieties
and encouraging them to vent their frustrations in public meetings. Rather
than arguing the practical aspects of a particular program, he would de­
scribe how it would affect them on the most primitive, down-to-earth level.
Do not believe that this approach works only with the illiterate and un­
schooled-it works on one and all. All of us are mortal and face the same
dreadful fate, and all of us share the desire for attachment and belonging.
Stir up these emotions and you captivate our hearts.
The best way to do this is with a dramatic jolt, of the kind that Chuko
Liang created when he fed and released prisoners who expected only the
worst from him. Shaking them to the core, he softened their hearts. Play on
contrasts like this: Push people to despair, then give them relief. If they ex­
pect pain and you give them pleasure, you win their hearts. Creating plea­
sure of any kind, in fact, will usually bring you success, as will allaying fears
and providing or promising security.
Symbolic gestures are often enough to win sympathy and goodwill. A
gesture of self-sacrifice, for example-a show that you suffer as those
around you do-will make people identify with you, even if your suffering
is symbolic or minor and theirs is real. When you enter a group, make a
gesture of goodwill; soften the group up for the harsher actions that will fol­
low later.
When T. E. Lawrence was fighting the Turks in the deserts of the Mid­
dIe East during World War I, he had an epiphany: It seemed to hirn that
conventional warfare had lost its value. The old-fashioned soldier was lost
in the enormous armies of the time, in which he was ordered about like a
lifeless pawn. Lawrence wanted to turn this around. For hirn, every sol­
dier's mind was a kingdom he had to conquer. A committed, psychologi­
cally motivated soldier would fight harder and more creatively than a
puppet.
Lawrence's perception is still more true in the world today, where so
many of us feel alienated, anonymous, and suspicious of authority, all of
which makes overt power plays and force even more counterproductive
and dangerous. Instead of manipulating lifeless pawns, make those on your
side convinced and excited by the cause you have enlisted them in; this
will not only make your work easier but it will also give you more leeway
to deceive them later on. And to accomplish this you need to deal with
their individual psychologies. Never clumsily assurne that the tactic that
worked on one person will necessarily work on another. To find the key
that will motivate them, first get them to open up. The more they talk, the
more they reveal about their likes and dislikes--the handles and levers to
move them with.
The quickest way to secure people's minds is by demonstrating, as
simply as possible, how an action will benefit them. Self-interest is the
LAW 43 373

[PAGE 398]
strongest motive of all: A great cause may capture minds, but once the first
flush of excitement is over, interest will flag-unless there is something to
be gained. Self-interest is the solider foundation. The causes that work best
use a noble veneer to cover a blatant appeal to self-interest; the cause se­
duces but the self-interest secures the deal.
The people who are best at appealing to people's minds are often
artists, intellectuals, and those of a more poetic nature. This is because
ideas are most easily communicated through metaphors and imagery. It is
always good policy, then, to have in your pocket at least one artist or intel­
lectual who can appeal concretely to people's minds. Kings have always
kept a stable of writers in their bam: Frederick the Great had his Voltaire
(until they quarreled and separated), Napoleon won over Goethe. Con­
versely, Napoleon III's alienation ofwriters such as Victor Hugo, whom he
exiled from France, contributed to his growing unpopularity and eventual
downfall. It is dangerous, then, to alienate those who have powers of ex­
pression, and useful to pacify and exploit them.
Finally, leam to play the numbers game. The wider your support base
the stronger your power. Understanding that one alienated, disaffected
soul can spark a blaze of discontent, Louis XIV made sure to endear him­
self to the lowest members of his staf.f You too must constantly win over
more allies on allievels-a time will inevitably come when you will need

The mirror rejlects reality, hut it is also the perfect tool for

as they do, they cannot figure out your strategy. The Mir­

them with the illusion that you share their values; by
holding up a mirror to their actions, you teach them a

Marie studied the future king dosely. She noticed that her sisters' frivolity

love, the deeds of great knights, the nobility of past kings and heroes. She
fed his thirst for glory by creating an image of an august, superior king
whom he could aspire to become. She stirred his imagination.
As the future Sun King spent more and more time in Marie's presence,
it eventually became dear that he had fallen in love with the least likely
young woman of the court. To the horror of her sisters and mother, he
showered Marie Mancini with attention. He brought her along on his mili­
tary campaigns, and made a show of stationing her where she could watch
as he marched into battle. He even promised Marie that he would marry
her and make her queen.
Mazarin, however, would never allow the king to marry his niece, a
woman who could bring France no diplomatie or royal alliances. Louis had
to marry a princess of Spain or Austria. In 1658 Louis succumbed to the
pressure and agreed to break off the first romantic involvement of his life.
He did so with much regret, and at the end of his life he acknowledged that
he never loved anyone as much as Marie Mancini.
LAW 44 383

[PAGE 408]
Interpretation
Marie Mancini played the seducer's game to perfection. First, she took a
step back, to study her prey. Seduction often fails to get past the first step
because it is too aggressive; the first move must always be a retreat. By
studying the king from a distance Marie saw what distinguished hirn from
others-his high ideals, romantic nature, and snobbish disdain for petty
politics. Marie's next step was to make a mirror for these hidden yearnings
on Louis's part, letting hirn glimpse what he hirnself could be-a godlike
king!
This mirror had several functions: Satisfying Louis's ego by giving hirn
a double to look at, it also focused on hirn so exdusively as to give him the
feeling that Marie existed for hirn alone. Surrounded by a pack of schem­
ing courtiers who only had their own self-interest at heart, he could not fall
to be touched by this devotional focus. Finally Marie's mirror set up an
ideal for hirn to live up to: the noble knight of the medieval court. To a soul
both romantic and ambitious, nothing could be more intoxicating than to
have someone hold up an idealized reflection of hirn. In effect it was Marie
Mancini who created the image of the Sun King-indeed Louis later ad­
mitted the enormous part she had played in fashioning his radiant self­
image.
This is the power of the Seducer's Mirror: By doubling the tastes and
ideals of the target, it shows your attention to his or her psychology, an at­
tention more charming than any aggressive pursuit. Find out what sets the
other person apart, then hold up the mirror that will reflect it and bring it
out of them. Feed their fantasies of power and greatness by reflecting their
ideals, and they will succumb.
Observance IV
In 1538, with the death of his mother, Helena, the eight-year-old future
czar Ivan IV (or Ivan the Terrible) of Russia became an orphan. For the
next five years he watched as the princely dass, the boyars, terrorized the
country. Now and then, to mock the young Ivan, they would make him
wear a crown and scepter and place hirn on the throne. When the little
boy's feet dangled over the edge of the chair, they would laugh and lift him
off it, handing hirn from man to man in the air, making hirn feel his help­
lessness compared to them.
When Ivan was thirteen, he boldly murdered the boyar leader and as­
cended to the throne. For the next few decades he struggled to subdue the
boyars' power, but they continued to defy hirn. By 1575 his efforts to trans­
form Russia and defeat its enemies had exhausted hirn. Meanwhile, his
subjects were complaining bitterly about his endless wars, his secret police,
the unvanquished and oppressive boyars. His own ministers began to ques­
tion his moves. Finally he had had enough. In 1564 he had temporarily
abandoned the throne, forcing his subjects to call hirn back to power. Now
he took the strategy a step further, and abdicated.
To take his place Ivan elevated a general of his, Simeon Bekbulatovich,
384 LAW 44

[PAGE 409]
to the throne. But although Simeon had recently converted to Christianity,
he was by birth a Tartar, and his enthronement was an insult to Ivan's sub­
jects, since Russians looked down on the Tartars as inferiors and infidels.
Yet Ivan ordered that all Russians, including the boyars, pledge obedience
to their new ruler. And while Simeon moved into the Kremlin, Ivan lived
in a humble house on Moscow's outskirts, from which he would sometimes
visit the palace, bow before the throne, sit among the other boyars, and
humbly petition Simeon for favors.
Over time it became clear that Simeon was a kind ofking's double. He
dressed like Ivan, and acted like Ivan, but he had no real power, since no
one would really obey hirn. The boyars at the court who were old enough
to remember taunting Ivan when he was a boy, by placing hirn on the
throne, saw the connection: They had made Ivan feel like a weak pre­
tender, so now he mirrored them by placing a weak pretender of his own
on the throne.
For two long years Ivan held the mirror of Simeon up to the Russian
people. The mirror said: Your whining and disobedience have made me a
czar with no real power, so I will reflect back to you a czar with no real
power. You have treated me disrespectfully, so I will do the same to you,
making Russia the laughingstock of the world. In 1577, in the name of the
Russian people, the chastised boyars once again begged Ivan to return to
the throne, which he did. He lived as czar until his death, in 1584, and the
eonspiracies, complaining, and second-guessing disappeared along with
Simeon.
Interpretation
In 1564, after threatening to abdicate, Ivan had been granted absolute pow­
ers. But these powers had slowly been chipped away as every sector of so­
eiety-the boyars, the church, the government-vied for more control.
Foreign wars had exhausted the country, internal bickering had increased,
and Ivan's attempts to respond had been met with scorn. Russia had turned
into a kind of boisterous classroom in which the pupils laughed openly at
the teaeher. If he raised his voice or complained, he only met more resis­
tance. He had to te ach them a lesson, give them a taste of their own medi­
eine. Simeon Bekbulatovich was the mirror he used to do so.
After two years in which the throne had been an object of ridicule and
disgust, the Russian people leamed their lesson. They wanted their czar
back, conceding to hirn all the dignity and respect that the position should
always have commanded. For the rest of his reign, Russia and Ivan got
along fine.
Understand: People are locked in their own experiences. When you
whine about some insensitivity on their part, they may seem to understand,
but inwardly they are untouched and even more resistant. The goal of
power is always to lower people's resistance to you. For this you need
tricks, and one trick is to teach them a lesson.
Instead of haranguing people verbally, then, create a kind of mirror of
their behavior. In doing so you leave them two choices: They can ignore
LAW 44 385

[PAGE 410]
you, or they can start to think about themselves. And even if they ignore
you, you will have planted a seed in their unconscious that will eventually
take root. When you mirror their behavior, incidentally, do not be afraid to
add a touch of caricature and exaggeration, as Ivan did by enthroning a
Tartar-it is the little spiee in the soup that will open their eyes and make
them see the ridiculousness in their own actions.
Observance V
Dr. Milton H. Erickson, a pioneer in strategie psychotherapy, would often
educate his patients powerfully but indirectly by creating a kind of mirror
effect. Constructing an analogy to make patients see the truth on their own,
he would bypass their resistance to change. When Dr. Erickson treated
married couples complaining of sexual problems, for instance, he often
found that psychotherapy's tradition of direct confrontation and probIern­
airing only heightened the spouses' resistance and sharpened their differ­
ences. Instead, he would draw a husband and wife out on other topics,
often banal ones, trying to find an analogy for the sexual conflict.
In one couple's first session, the pair were discussing their eating
habits, especially at dinner. The wife preferred the leisurely approach-a
drink before the meal, some appetizers, and then a small main course, all at
a slow, civilized pace. This frustrated the husband-he wanted to get din­
ner over quickly and to dig right into the main course, the bigger the better.
As the conversation continued, the couple began to catch glimpses of an
analogy to their problems in bed. The moment they made this connection,
however, Dr. Erickson would change the subject, carefully avoiding a dis­
cussion of the real problem.
The couple thought Erickson was just getting to know them and would
deal with the problem directly the next time he saw them. But at the end of
this first session, Dr. 'Erickson directed them to arrange a dinner a few
nights away that would combine each person's desire: The wife would get
the slow meal, including time spent bond ing, and the husband would get
the big dishes he wanted to eat. Without realizing they were acting under
the doctor's gentle guidance, the couple would walk into a mirror of their
problem, and in the mirror they would solve their problems themselves,
ending the evening just as the doctor had hoped-by mirroring the im­
proved dinner dynamies in bed.
In dealing with more severe problems, such as the schizophrenie's
mirror fantasy world of his or her own construction, Dr. Erickson would al­
ways try to enter the mirror and work within it. He once treated a hospital
inmate who believed he was Jesus Christ-draping sheets around his
body, talking in vague parables, and bombarding staff and patients with
endless Christian proselytizing. No therapy or drugs seemed to work, until
one day Dr. Erickson went up to the young man and said, "I understand
you have had experience as a carpenter." Being Christ, the patient had to
say that he had had such experience, and Erickson immediately put hirn to
work building bookcases and other useful items, allowing hirn to wear his
Jesus garb. Over the next weeks, as the patient worked on these projects,
386 LAW 44

his mind became less occupied with Jesus fantasies and more focused on
his labor. As the carpentry work took precedence, a psychic shift took ef­
feet: The religious fantasies remained, but faded comfortably into the back­
ground, allowing the man to function in society.
Interpretation
Communication depends on metaphors and symbols, which are the basis
of language itself. A metaphor is a kind of mirror to the concrete and real,
which it often expresses more clearly and deeply than a literal description
does. When you are dealing with the intractable willpower of other people,
direct communication often only heightens their resistance.
This happens most clearly when you complain about people's behav­
ior, particularly in sensitive areas such as their lovemaking. You will effect
a far more lasting change if, like Dr. Erickson, you construct an analogy, a
symbolic mirror of the situation, and guide the other through it. As Christ
hirnself understood, talking in parables is often the best way to teach a les­
son, for it allows people to realize the truth on their OWll.
When dealing with people who are lost in the reflections of fantasy
worlds (including a host of people who do not live in mental hospitals),
never try to push them into reality by shattering their mirrors. Instead,
enter their world and operate inside it, under their rules, gently guiding
them out of the hall of mirrors they have entered.

The great sixteenth-century Japanese tea master Takeno Sho-o once
passed by a house and noticed a young man watering flowers near his front
gate. Two things caught Sho-o's attention-first, the graceful way the man
performed his task; and, second, the stunningly beautiful rose of Sharon
blossoms that bloomed in the garden. He stopped and introduced hirnself
to the man, whose name was Sen no Rikyu. Sho-o wanted to stay, but he
had a prior engagement and had to hurry off. Before he left, however,
Rikyu invited hirn to take tea with him the following morning. Sho-o hap­
pily accepted.
When Sho-o opened the garden gate the next day, he was horrified to
see that not a single flower remained. More than anything else, he had
come to see the rose of Sharon blossoms that he had not had the time to ap­
preciate the day before; now, disappointed, he started to leave, but at the
gate he stopped hirnself, and decided to enter Sen no Rikyu's tea room. Im­
mediately inside, he stopped in his tracks and gazed in astonishment: Be­
fore hirn a vase hung from the ceiling, and in the vase stood a single rose of
Sharon blossom, the most beautiful in the garden. Somehow Sen no Rikyu
had read his guest's thoughts, and, with this one eloquent gesture, had
demonstrated that this day guest and host would be in perfect harmony.
Sen no Rikyu went on to become the most famous tea master of all,
and his trademark was this uncanny ability to harmonize hirnself with his
guests' thoughts and to think one step ahead, enchanting them by adapting
to their taste.
One day Rikyu was invited to tea by Yamashina Hechigwan, an ad-
LAW 44 387

[PAGE 412]
mirer of the tea ceremony but also a man with a vivid sense of humor.
When Rikyu arrived at Hechigwan's horne, he found the garden gate shut,
so he opened it to look for the host. On the other side of the gate he saw
that someone had first dug a ditch, then carefully covered it over with can­
vas and earth. Realizing that Hechigwan had planned a practical joke, he
obligingly walked right into the ditch, muddying his clothes in the process.
Apparently horrified, Hechigwan came running out, and hurried
Rikyu to a bath that for some inexplicable reason stood already prepared.
After bathing, Rikyu joined Hechigwan in the tea ceremony, which both
enjoyed immensely, sharing a laugh about the accident. Later Sen no
Rikyu explained to a friend that he had heard about Hechigwan's practical
joke beforehand, "But since it should always be one's aim to conform to
the wishes of one's host, I fell into the hole knowingly and thus assured the
success of the meeting. Tea is by no means mere obsequiousness, but there
is no tea where the host and guest are not in harmony with one another."
Hechigwan's vision of the dignified Sen no Rikyu at the bottom of a ditch
had pleased him endlessly, but Rikyu had gained a pleasure of his own
in complying with his host's wish and watching him amuse hirnself in
this way.
Interpretation
Sen no Rikyu was no magician or seer-he watched those around hirn
acutely, plumbing the subtle gestures that revealed a hidden desire, then
producing that desire's image. Although Sho-o never spoke of being en­
chanted by the rose of Sharon blossoms, Rikyu read it in his eyes. If mir­
roring a person's desires meant falling into a ditch, so be it. Rikyu's power
resided in his skillful use of the Courtier's Mirror, which gave hirn the ap­
pearance of an unusual ability to see into other people.
Learn to manipulate the Courtier's MirrOf, for it will bring you great
power. Study people's eyes, follow their gestures-surer barometers of pain
and pleasure than any spoken word. Notice and remember the details-the
clothing, the choice of friends, the daily habits, the tossed-out remarks­
that reveal hidden and rarely indulged desires. Soak it all in, find out what
lies under the surface, then make yourself the mirror of their unspoken
selves. That is the key to this power: The other person has not asked for
your consideration, has not mentioned his pleasure in the rose of Sharon,
and when you reflect it back to hirn his pleasure is heightened because it is
unasked for. Remember: The wordless communication, the indirect com­
pliment, contains the most power. No one can resist the enchantment of the
Courtier's Mirror.

Yellow Kid Weil, con artist extraordinaire, used the Deceiver's Mirror in
his most brilliant cons. Most audacious of all was his re-creation of a bank
in Muncie, Indiana. When Weil read one day that the Merchants Bank in
Muncie had moved, he saw an opportunity he could not pass up.
Weil rented out the original Merchants building, which still contained
bank furniture, complete with teller windows. He bought money bags,
388 LAW 44

[PAGE 413]
stenciled a bank's invented name on them, filled them with steel washers,
and arrayed them impressively behind the teller windows, along with bun­
dIes of boodle-real bills hiding newspaper cut to size. For his bank's staff
and customers Weil hired gambIers, bookies, girls from local bawdy
houses, and other assorted confederates. He even had a local thug pose as a
bank dick.
Claiming to be the broker for a certificate investment the bank was of­
fering, Weil would fish the waters and hook the proper wealthy sucker. He
would bring this man to the bank and ask to see the president. An "officer"
of the bank would tell them that they had to wait, which only heightened
the realism of the con-one always has to wait to see the bank president.
And as they waited the bank would bustle with banklike activity, as call
girls and bookies in disguise floated in and out, making deposits and with­
drawals and tipping their hats to the phony bank dick. Lulled by this per­
feet copy of reality, the sucker would deposit $50,000 into the fake bank
without a worry in the world.
Over the years Weil did the same thing with adeserted yacht club, an
abandoned brokerage office, a relocated real estate office, and a com­
pletely realistic gambling club.
Interpretation
The mirroring of reality offers immense deceptive powers. The right uni­
form, the perfect accent, the proper props-t-he deception cannot be deci­
phered because it is enmeshed in a simulation of reality. People have an
intense desire and need to believe, and their first instinct is to trust a well­
construeted facade, to mistake it for reality. After al,l we cannot go around
doubting the reality of everything we see-that would be too exhausting.
We habitually accept appearances, and this is a credulity you can use.
In this particular game it is the first moment that counts the most. If
YOUf suckers' suspicions are not raised by their first glance at the mirror's
reflection, they will stay suppressed. Once they enter your hall of mirrors,
they will be unable to distinguish the real from the fake, and it will become
easier and easier to deceive them. Remember: Study the world's surfaces
and leam to mirror them in your habits, your manner, YOUf clothes. Like a
camivorous plant, to unsuspecting insects you will look like all the other
plants in the field.
Authority: The task of a military operation is to accord decep­
tively with the intentions of the enemy . . .g et to what they want
first, subtly anticipate them. Maintain discipline and adapt to
the enemy . . . . Thus, at first you are like a maiden, so the enemy
opens his door; then you are like a rabbit on the loose, so

A WARNING: BEWARE OF MIRRORED SITUATIONS
Mirrors contain great power but also dangerous reefs, including the mir­

vious one, mostly in style and surface appearance. You can often back into
such a situation without fuHy understanding it, while those around you un­

the previous occupant of your position or else tainted by any unpleasant
associations that person has left behind.
In 1864 the composer Richard Wagner moved to Munich at the behest
of Ludwig 11, known variously as the Swan King or the Mad King of
Bavaria. Ludwig was Wagner's biggest fan and most generous patron. The
strength of his support tumed Wagner's head-once established in Munich
under the king's protection, he would be able to say and do whatever he
wanted.
Wagner moved into a lavish house, which the king eventually bought
for hirn. This house was but a stone's throw from the former horne of Lola
Montez, the notorious courtesan who had plunged Ludwig lI's grandfather
into a crisis that had forced hirn to abdicate. Wamed that he could be in­
fected by this association, Wagner only scoffed-"I am no Lola Montez,"
he said. So on enough, however, the citizens of Munich began to resent the
favors and money showered on Wagner, and dubbed hirn "the second
Lola," or "Lolotte." He unconsciously began to tread in Lola's footsteps­
spending money extravagantly, meddling in matters beyond music, even
dabbling in politics and advising the king on cabinet appointments. Mean­
while Ludwig's affection for Wagner seemed intense and undignified for a
king-just like his grandfather's love for Lola Montez.
390 LAW 44

[PAGE 415]
Eventually Ludwig's ministers wrote bim a letter: "Your Majesty now
stands at a fateful parting of the ways: you have to choose between the love
and respect of your faithful people and the 'friendship' of Richard Wag­
ner." In December of 1865, Ludwig politely asked bis friend to leave and
never return. Wagner had inadvertently placed himself in Lola Montez's
reflection. Once there, everything he did reminded the stolid Bavarians of
that dread woman, and there was nothing he could do abo ut it.
Avoid such association-effects like the plague. In a mirrored situation
you have little or no control over the reflections and recollections that will
be connected to you, and any situation beyond your control is dangerous.
Even if the person or event has positive associations, you will suffer from
not being able to live up to them, since the past generally appears greater
than the present. If you ever notice people associating you with some past
event or person, do everything you can to separate yourself from that
memory and to shatter the reflection.

and threat, we latch on to familiar faces and create habits and rituals to
make the world more comfortable. Change can be pleasant and even
sometimes desirable in the abstract, but too much of it creates an anxiety
that will stir and boil beneath the surface and then eventually erupt.
Never underestimate the hidden conservatism of those around you. It
is powerful and entrenched. Never let the seductive charm of an idea cloud
your reason: lust as you cannot make people see the world your way, you
cannot wrench them into the future with painful changes. They will rebel.
If reform is necessary, anticipate the re action against it and find ways to
disguise the change and sweeten the poison.
OBSERVANCE OF THE LAW
As a young Communist in the 1920s, Mao Tse-tung understood better than
any of his colleagues the incredible odds against a Communist victory in
394 LAW 45

[PAGE 419]
China. With their small numbers, limited funds, lack of military experi­
ence, and small arsenal of weapons, the Party had no hope of success un­
less it won over China's immense peasant population. But who in the
world was more conservative, more rooted in tradition, than the Chinese
peasantry? The oldest civilization on the planet had a history that would
never loosen its power, no matter how violent the revolution. The ideas of
Confucius remained as alive in the 1920s as they had been in the sixth cen­
tury B.C., when the philosopher was alive. Despite the oppressions of the
current system, would the peasantry ever give up the deep-rooted values of
the past for the great unknown of Communism?
The solution, as Mao saw it, involved a simple deception: Cloak the
revolution in the clothing of the past, making it comforting and legitimate
in people's eyes. One of Mao's favorite books was the very popular me­
dieval Chinese novel The Water Margin, which recounts the exploits of a
Chinese Robin Hood and his robber band as they struggle against a cor­
rupt and evil monarch. In China in Mao's time, family ties dominated over
any other kind, for the Confucian hierarchy of father and oldest son re­
mained firmly in place; but The Water Margin preached a superior value­
the fraternal ties of the band of robbers, the nobility of the cause that unites
people beyond blood. The novel had great emotional resonance for Chi­
nese people, who love to root for the underdog. Time and again, then,
Mao would present his revolutionary army as an extension of the robber
band in The Water Margin, likening his struggle to the timeless conflict be­
tween the oppressed peasantry and an evil emperor. He made the past
seem to envelop and legitimize the Communist cause; the peasantry could
feel comfortable with and even support a group with such roots in the past.
Even on ce the Party came to power, Mao continued to associate it with
the past. He presented himself to the masses not as a Chinese Lenin but as
a modern Chuko Liang, the real-life third-century strategist who figures
prominently in the popular historical novel The Romance 0/ the Three King­
doms. Liang was more than a great general-he was a poet, a philosoph er,
and a figure of stern moral rectitude. So Mao represented himself as a poet­
warrior like Liang, a man who mixed strategy with philosophy and
preached a new ethics. He made himself appear like a hero from the great
Chinese tradition of warrior statesmen.
Soon, everything in Mao's speeches and writings had a reference to an
earlier period in Chinese history. He recalled, for example, the great Em­
peror Ch'in, who had unified the country in the third century B.C. Ch'in
had burned the works of Confucius, consolidated and completed the build­
ing of the Great Wall, and given his name to China. Like Ch'in, Mao also
had brought the country together, and had sought bold reforms against an
oppressive past. Ch'in had traditionally been seen as a violent dictator
whose reign was short; the brilliance of Mao's strategy was to turn this
around, simultaneously reinterpreting Ch'in, justifying his rule in the eyes
of present-day Chinese, and using him to justify the violence of the new
order that Mao himself was creating.
Mter the failed Cultural Revolution of the late 1960s, apower struggle
LAW 45 395

[PAGE 420]
emerged in the Communist Party in which Mao's main foe was Lin Piao,
once a elose friend of his. To make elear to the masses the difference be­
tween his philosophy and Lin's, Mao once again exploited the past: He
cast his opponent as representing Confucius, a philosopher Lin in fact
would constantly quote. And Confucius signified the conservatism of the
past. Mao associated himself, on the other hand, with the ancient philo­
sophical movement known as Legalism, exemplified by the writings of
Han-fei-tzu. The Legalists disdained Confucian ethics; they believed in the
need for violence to create a new order. They worshiped power. To give
hirnself weight in the struggle, Mao unleashed a nationwide propaganda
campaign against Confucius, using the issues of Confucianism versus Le­
galism to whip the young into a kind of frenzied revolt against the older
generation. This grand context enveloped a rather banal power struggle,
and Mao once again won over the masses and triumphed over his enemies.
Interpretation
No people had a more profound attachment to the past than the Chinese.
In the face of this enormous obstaele to reform, Mao's strategy was simple:
Instead of struggling against the past, he turned it to his advantage, associ­
ating his radical Communists with the romantic figures of Chinese history.
Weaving the story of the War of the Three Kingdoms into the struggle be­
tween the United States, the Soviet Union, and China, he cast hirnself as
Chuko Liang. As the emperors had, he welcomed the cultlike adoration of
the masses, understanding that the Chinese could not function without
some kind of father figure to admire. And after he made a terrible blunder
with the Great Leap Forward, trying to force modernization on the country
and failing miserably, he never repeated his mistake: From then on, radical
change had to be eloaked in the comfortable elothes of the past.
The lesson is simple: The past is powerful. What has happened before
seems greater; habit and history give any act weight. Use this to your ad­
vantage. When you destroy the familiar you create a void or vacuum; peo­
pIe fear the chaos that will flood in to fill it. You must avoid stirring up such
fe ars at all cost. Borrow the weight and legitimacy from the past, however
remote, to create a comforting and familiar presence. This will give your
actions romantic associations, add to your presence, and eloak the nature
of the changes you are attempting.
It must be considered that there is nothing more difficult to carry out,
nor more doubtful 0/ success, nor more dangerous to handle,
than to initiate a new order 0/ things.

KEYS TO POWER
Human psychology contains many dualities, one of them being that even
while people understand the need for change, knowing how important it is
for institutions and individuals to be occasionally renewed, they are also ir-
396 LAW 45

[PAGE 421]
ritated and upset by changes that affect them personally. They know that
change is necessary, and that novelty provides relief from boredom, but
deep inside they cling to the past. Change in the abstract, or superficial
change, they desire, but a change that upsets core habits and routines is
deeply disturbing to them.
No revolution has gone without a powerftIllater reaction against it, for
in the long run the void it creates proves too unsettling to the human ani­
mal, who unconsciously associates such voids with death and chaos. The
opportunity for change and renewal seduces people to the side of the revo­
lution, but once their enthusiasm fades, which it wil,l they are left with a
certain emptiness. Yearning for the past, they create an opening for it to
creep back in.
For Machiavelli, the prophet who preaches and brings change can
only survive by taking up arms: When the masses inevitably yearn for the
past, he must be ready to use force. But the armed prophet cannot last long
unless he quickly creates a new set of values and rituals to replace the old
ones, and to soothe the anxieties of those who dread change. It is far easier,
and less bloody, to playakind of con game. Preach change as much as you
like, and even enact your reforms, but give them the comforting appear­
ance of older events and traditions.
Reigning from A.D. 8 to A.D. 23, the Chinese emperor Wang Mang
emerged from aperiod of great historical turbulence in which the people
yearned for order, an order represented for them by Confucius. Some two
hundred years earlier, however, Emperor Ch'in had ordered the writings
of Confucius burned. A few years later, word had spread that certain texts
had miraculously survived, hidden under the scholar's house. These texts
may not have been genuine, but they gave Wang his opportunity: He first
confiscated them, then had his scribes insert passages into them that
seemed to support the changes he had been imposing on the country.
When he released the texts, it seemed that Confucius sanctioned Wang's
reforms, and the people feIt comforted and accepted them more easily.
Understand: The fact that the past is dead and buried gives you the
freedom to reinterpret it. To support YOUT cause, tinker with the facts. The
past is a text in which you can safely insert YOUT own lines.
A simple ge sture like using an old title, or keeping the same number
for a group, will tie you to the past and support you with the authority of
history. As Machiavelli hirnself observed, the Romans used this device
when they transformed their monarchy into a republic. They may have in­
stalled two consuls in place of the king, but since the king had been served
by twelve lictors, they retained the same number to serve under the con­
suls. The king had personally performed an annual sacrifice, in a great
spectacle that stirred the public; the republic retained this practice, only
transferring it to a special "chief of the ceremony, whom they called the
King of the sacrifice." These and similar ge stures satisfied the people and
kept them from clamoring for the monarchy's return.
Another strategy to disguise change is to make a loud and public dis­
play of support for the values of the past. Seem to be a zealot for tradition

and few will notice how unconventional you really are. Renaissance Flo­
rence had a centuries-old republic, and was suspicious of anyone who
flouted its traditions. Cosimo de' Medici made a show of enthusiastic sup­
port for the republic, while in reality he worked to bring the city under the
control of his wealthy family. In form, the Medicis retained the appearance
of a republic; in substance, they rendered it powerless. They quietly en­
acted a radical change, while appearing to safeguard tradition.
Science claims a search for truth that would seem to protect it from
conservatism and the irrationality of habit: It is a culture of innovation. Yet
when Charles Darwin published his ideas of evolution, he faced fiercer op­
position from his fellow scientists than from religious authorities. His theo­
ries challenged too many fixed ideas. Jonas Salk ran into the same wall
with his radical innovations in immunology, as did Max Planck with his
revolutionizing of physics. Planck later wrote of the scientific opposition he
faced, "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents
and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually
die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."
The answer to this innate conservatism is to play the cOUftier's game.
Galileo did this at the beginning of his scientific career; he later became
more confrontational, and paid for it. So pay lip service to tradition. Iden­
tify the elements in YOUf revolution that can be made to seem to build on
the past. Say the right things, make a show of conformity, and meanwhile
let YOUf theories do their radical work. Play with appearances and respect
past protocol. This is true in every arena-science being no exception.
Finally, powerful people pay attention to the zeitgeist. If their reform is
too far ahead of its time, few will understand it, and it will stir up anxiety
and be hopelessly misinterpreted. The changes you make must seem less
innovative than they are. England did eventually become a Protestant na­
tion, as Cromwell wished, but it took over a century of gradual evolution.
Watch the zeitgeist. If you work in a tumultuous time, there is power to
be gained by preaching areturn to the past, to comfort, tradition, and rit­
ual. During aperiod of stagnation, on the other hand, play the card of re­
form and revolution-but beware of what you stir up. Those who finish a
revolution are rarely those who start it. You will not succeed at this danger­
ous game unless you are willing to fore stall the inevitable re action against it
by playing with appearances and building on the past.
Authority: He who desires or attempts to reform the government of a
state, and wishes to have it accepted, must at least retain the semblance of
the oid forms; so that it may seem to the people that there has been no
change in the institutions, even though in fact they are entirely different
from the oid ones. For the great majority of mankind are satisfied with ap­
pearances, as though they were realities. (Niccolö Machiavelli, 1469-1527)

Image: The Cat.
Creature of habit, it loves the

routines, disrupt its space, and it will

Placate it by supporting its rituals. If
change is necessary, deceive the cat by
keeping the smell of the past alive;
place objects familiar to it in
strategie locations.
REVERSAL
The past is a corpse to be used as you see fit. If what happened in the re­
cent past was painful and harsh, it is self-destructive to associate yourself
with it. When Napoleon came to power, the French Revolution was fresh
in everyone's minds. If the court that he established had borne any resem­
blance to the lavish court of Louis XVI and Marie-Antoinette, his courtiers
would have spent all their time worrying about their own necks. Instead,
Napoleon established a court remarkable for its sobriety and lack of osten­
tation. It was the court of a man who valued work and military virtues. This
new form seemed appropriate and reassuring.
In other words, pay attention to the times. But understand: If you
make a bold change from the past, you must avoid at all costs the appear­
ance of a void or vacuum, or you will create terror. Even an ugly recent his­
tory will seem preferable to an empty space. Fill that space immediately
with new rituals and forms. Soothing and growing familiar, these will seeure
your position among the masses.
Finally, the arts, fashion, and technology would seem to be areas in
which power would come from creating a radical rupture with the past and
appearing cutting edge. Indeed, such a strategy can bring great power, but
it has many dangers. It is inevitable that your innovations will be outdone
by someone else. You have little control-someone younger and fresher
moves in a sudden new direction, making your bold innovation of yester­
day seem tiresome and tarne today. You are forever playing catch-up; your
power is tenuous and short-lived. You want a power built on something
more solid. Using the past, tinkering with tradition, playing with conven­
tion to subvert it will give your creations something more than a momen­
tary appeal. Periods of dizzying change disguise the fact that a yearning for
the past will inevitably creep back in. In the end, using the past for your
own purposes will bring you more power than trying to cut it out com­
pletely-a futile and self-destructive endeavor.

the river and made his camp on the eastern side, he set the table for an
elaborate banquet, full of meat, delicacies, and strong wine. Then he left
his weakest troops in the camp and withdrew the rest of the army to the
river. A large Massagetai detachment so on attacked the camp and killed all
of the Persian soldiers in a fierce battle. Then, overwhelmed by the fabu­
lous feast that had been left behind, they ate and drank to their hearts' con­
tent. Later, inevitably, they fell asleep. The Persian army returned to the
camp that night, killing many of the sleeping soldiers and capturing the
rest. Among the prisoners was their general, a youth named Spargapises,
son of Queen Tomyris.
When the queen learned what had happened, she sent a message to
Cyrus, chid ing him for using tricks to defeat her army. "Now listen to me,"
she wrote, "and I will advise you for YOUf own good: Give me back my son
and leave my country with YOUf forces intact, and be content with yoUf tri­

come to believe your character is more responsible for your success than

realize that your moment of triumph is also a moment when you have to

Napoleon Bonaparte, 1769-1821
KEYS TO POWER
Power has its own rhythms and patterns. Those who succeed at the game
are the ones who control the patterns and vary them at will, keeping peo­
pIe off balance while they set the tempo. The essence of strategy is control­
ling what comes next, and the elation of victory can upset your ability to
control what comes next in two ways. First, you owe your success to a pat­
tern that you are apt to try to repeat. You will try to keep moving in the
same direction without stopping to see whether this is still the direction that
is best for you. Second, success tends to go to your head and make you
emotional. Feeling invulnerable, you make aggressive moves that ulti­
mately undo the victory you have gained.
The lesson is simple: The powernd vary their rhythms and patterns,
change course, adapt to circumstance, and leam to improvise. Rather than
letting their dancing feet impel them forward, they step back and look
where they are going. It is as if their bloodstream bore a kind of antidote to
the intoxication of victory, letting them control their emotions and come to
a kind of mental halt when they have attained success. They steady them­
selves, give themselves the space to reflect on what has happened, examine
the role of circumstance and luck in their success. As they say in riding
school, you have to be able to control yourself before you can control the
horse.
Luck and circumstance always playa role in power. This is inevitable,
and actually makes the game more interesting. But despite what you may
think, good luck is more dangerous than bad luck. Bad luck teaches valu­
able lessons about patience, timing, and the need to be prepared for the
worst; good luck deludes you into the opposite lesson, making you think
your brillliance will carry you through. Your fortune will inevitably turn,
and when it does you will be completely unprepared.
According to Machiavelli, this is what undid Cesare Borgia. He had
many triumphs, was actually a clever strategist, but had the bad luck to
have good luck: He had a pope for a father. Then, when he had bad luck
for real-his father's death-he was unprepared for it, and the many ene-

fortune will hurtle you down as easily as up. If you prepare for the fall, it is
less likely to ruin you when it happens.
People who have a run of success can catch a kind of fever, and even
when they themselves try to stay calm, the people below them often pres­
sure them to go past their mark and into dangerous waters. You have to
have a strategy for dealing with these people. Simply preaching modera­
tion will make you look weak and small-minded; seeming to fail to follow
up on a victory can lessen your power.
When the Athenian general and statesman Pericles led a series of
naval campaigns around the Black Sea in 436 B.C., his easy triumphs en­
flamed the Athenians' desire for more. They dreamed of conquering
Egypt, overrunning Persia, sailing for Sicily. On the one hand Pericles
reined in these dangerous emotions by warning of the perils of hubris. On
the other hand he fed them by fighting small battles that he knew he could
win, creating the appearance that he was preserving the momentum of suc­
cess. The skill with which Pericles played this game is revealed by what
happened when he died: The demagogues took over, pushed Athens into
invading Sicily, and in one rash move destroyed an empire.
The rhythm of power often requires an alternation of force and cun­
ning. Too much force creates a counterreaction; too much cunning, no
matter how cunning it is, becomes predictable. Working on behalf of his
master, the shogun Oda Nobunaga, the great sixteenth-century Japanese
general (and future emperor) Hideyoshi once engineered a stunning vic­
tory over the army of the formidable General Yoshimoto. The shogun
wanted to go further, to take on and crush yet another powerful enemy, but
Hideyoshi reminded him of the old Japanese saying: "When you have
won a victory, tighten the strings of your helmet." For Hideyoshi this was
the moment for the shogun to switch from force to cunning and indirec­
tion, setting his enemies against one another through aseries of deceptive
alliances. In this way he would avoid stirring up needless opposition by
appearing overly aggressive. When you are victorious, then, lie low, and
lull the enemy into inaction. These changes of rhythm are immensely
powerful.
People who go past the mark are often motivated by adesire to please
a master by proving their dedication. But an excess of effort exposes you to
the risk of making the master suspicious of you. On several occasions, gen­
erals under Philip of Macedon were disgraced and demoted immediately
after leading their troops to a great victory; one more such victory, Philip
thought, and the man might become a riyal instead of an underling. When
you serve a master, it is often wise to measure your victories carefully, let­
ting him get the glory and never making him uneasy. It is also wise to es­
tablish a pattern of strict obedience to earn his trust. In the fourth century
B.C., a captain under the notoriously severe Chinese general Wu Ch'i
charged ahead before a battle had begun and came back with several
416 LAW 47

[PAGE 441]
enemy heads. He thought he had shown his fiery enthusiasm, but Wu Ch'i
was unimpressed. "A talented officer," the general said with a sigh as he or­
dered the man beheaded, "but a disobedient one."
Another moment when a small success can spoil the chances for a
larger one may come if a master or superior grants you a favor: It is a dan­
gerous mistake to ask for more. You will seem insecure-perhaps you feel
you did not deserve this favor, and have to grab as much as you can when
you have the chance, which may not come again. The proper response is
to accept the favor graciously and withdraw. Any subsequent favors you
should eam without having to ask for them.
Finally, the moment when you stop has great dramatic import. What
comes last sticks in the mind as a kind of exclamation point. There is no
better time to stop and walk away than after a victory. Keep going and you
risk lessening the effect, even ending up defeated. As lawyers say of cross­
examination, ''Always stop with a victory."

Authority: Princes and republics should content themselves with victory,
for when they aim at more, they generally lose. The use of insulting lan­
guage toward an enemy arises from the insolence of victory, or from the
false hope of victory, which latter misleads men as often in their actions
as in their words; for when this false hope takes possession of the mind,
it makes men go beyond the mark, and causes them to sacrifice a cer­
tain good for an uncertain better. (Niccolo Machiavelli, 1469-1527)

REVERSAL
As Machiavelli says, either destroy a man or leave hirn alone entirely. In­
flicting half punishment or mild injury will only create an enemy whose
hitterness will grow with time, and who will take revenge. When you heat
an enemy, then, make your victory complete. Crush hirn into nonexis­
tence. In the moment of victory, you do not restrain yourself from crushing
the enemy you have defeated, hut rather from needlessly advancing
against others. Be merciless with your enemy, hut do not create new ene­
mies hy overreaching.
There are some who hecome more cautious than ever after a victory,
which they see as just giving them more possessions to worry ahout and
protect. Your caution after victory should never make you hesitate, or lose
momentum, hut rather act as a safeguard against rash action. On the other
hand, momentum as a phenomenon is greatly overrated. You create your
own successes, and if they follow one upon the other, it is your own doing.
Belief in momentum will only make you emotional, less prone to act strate­
gically, and more apt to repeat the same methods. Leave momentum for
those who have nothing hetter to rely upon.

In facing a serious problem-controlling superior numbers-Sparta
reacted like an animal that develops a shell to protect itself from the envi­
ronment. But like a turde, the Spartans sacrificed mobility for safety. They
managed to preserve stability for three hundred years, but at what cost?
They had no culture beyond warfare, no arts to relieve the tension, a con­
stant anxiety about the status quo. While their neighbors took to the sea,
leaming to adapt to a world of constant motion, the Spartans entombed
themselves in their own system. Victory would mean new lands to govem,
which they did not want; defeat would mean the end of their military ma­
chine, which they did not want, either. Only stasis allowed them to survive.
But nothing in the world can remain stable forever, and the shell or system
you evolve for your protection will someday prove your undoing.

out-of-the-way corners. Their small units harassed the Nationalist arrnies,
ambushing them here, retreating unexpectedly there, but these dispersed
units never linked up, making them hard to attack. They would seize a
town only to give it up a few weeks later. Forming neither rear guards nor
vanguards, they moved like mercury, never staying in one place, elusive
and formless.
The Nationalists ascribed this to two things: cowardice in the face
of superior forces and inexperience in strategy. Mao Tse-tung, the Com­

ideas influenced Mao, who found in his writings an uncanny Western
equivalent to wei-chi. Lawrence was working with Arabs fighting for their
territory against the Turks. His idea was to make the Arabs blend into the
vast desert, never providing a target, never collecting together in one place.
As the Turks scrambled to fight this vaporous army, they spread them­
selves thin, wasting energy in moving from place to place. They had the su­
perior firepower but the Arabs kept the initiative by playing cat and
mouse, giving the Turks nothing to hold on to, destroying their morale.

Lawrence wrote. "We were to contain the enemy by the silent threat of a
vast unknown desert, not disdosing ourselves till we attacked."
This is the ultimate form of strategy. The war of engagement has be­
come far too dangerous and costly; indirection and elusiveness yield far
better results at a much lower cost. The main cost, in fact, is mental-the
thinking it takes to align your forces in scattered patterns, and to under­
mine the minds and psychology of your opponents. And nothing will infu­
riate and disorient them more than formlessness. In a world where wars of
detachment are the order of the day, formlessness is crucial.
The first psychological requirement of formlessness is to train yourself
to take nothing personally. Never show any defensiveness. When you act
defensive, you show your emotions, revealing a dear form. Your oppo­
nents will realize they have hit a nerve, an Achilles' heel. And they will hit
it again and again. So train yourself to take nothing personally. Never let
anyone get your back up. Be like a slippery ball that cannot be held: Let no
one know what gets to you, or where your weaknesses lie. Make your face
a formless mask and you will infuriate and disorient your scheming col­
leagues and opponents.
One man who used this technique was Baron J ames Rothschild. A
German Jew in Paris, in a culture decidedly unfriendly to foreigners, Roth­
schild never took any attack on hirn personally or showed he had been
hurt in any way. He furthermore adapted hirnself to the political dimate,
whatever it was-the stiffly formal Restoration monarchy of Louis XVIII,
the bourgeois reign of Louis-Philippe, the democratic revolution of 1848,
the upstart Louis-Napoleon crowned emperor in 1852. Rothschild ac­
cepted them one and al,l and blended in. He could afford to appear hypo­
critical or opportunistic because he was valued for his money, not his
politics; his money was the currency of power. While he adapted and
thrived, outwardly never showing a form, all the other great families that
had begun the century immensely wealthy were ruined in the period's
complicated shifts and turns of fortune. Attaching themselves to the past,
they revealed their embrace of a form.
Throughout history, the formless style of ruling has been most adeptly
practiced by the queen who reigns alone. A queen is in a radically different
position from a king; because she is a woman, her subjects and courtiers
are likely to doubt her ability to rule, her strength of character. If she favors
426 LAW 48

[PAGE 451]
one side in some ideological struggle, she is said to be acting out of emo­
tional attachment. Yet if she represses her emotions and plays the authori­
tarian, in the male fashion, she arouses worse criticism still. Either by
nature or by experience, then, queens tend to adopt a flexible style of gov­
erning that in the end often proves more powerful than the more direct,
male form.
Two female leaders exemplifying the formless style of rule are Queen
Elizabeth of England and Empress Catherine the Great of Russia. In the vi­
olent wars between Catholics and Protestants, Elizabeth steered amiddIe
course. She avoided alliances that would commit her to one side, and that
over time would harm the country. She managed to keep her country at
peace until it was strong enough for war. Her reign was one of the most glo­
rious in his tory because of her incredible capacity to adapt and her flexible
ideology.
Catherine the Great too evolved an improvisatory style of governing.
Mter she deposed her husband, Emperor Peter II, taking sole control of
Russia in 1762, no one thought she would survive. But she had no precon­
ceived ideas, no philosophy or theory to dictate her policies. Although a
foreigner (she came from Germany), she understood Russia's moods, and
how it was changing over the years. "One must govern in such a way that
one's people think they themselves want to do what one commands them
to do," she said, and to do this she had to be always a step ahead of their
desires and to adapt to their resistance. By never forcing the issue, she re­
formed Russia in a strikingly short period of time.
This feminine, formless style of ruling may have emerged as a way of
prospering under difficult circumstances, but it has proved immensely se­
ductive to those who have served under it. Being fluid, it is relatively easy
for its subjects to obey, for they feelless coerced, less bent to their ruler's
ideology. It also opens up options where an adherence to a doctrine closes
them off. Without committing to one side, it allows the ruler to play one
enemy off another. Rigid rulers may seem strong, but with time their in­
flexibility wears on the nerves, and their subjects find ways to push them
from the stage. Flexible, formless rulers will be much criticized, but they
will endure, and people will eventually come to identify with them, since
they are as their subjects are-changing with the wind, open to circum­
stance.
Despite upsets and delays, the permeable style of power generally tri­
umphs in the end, just as Athens eventually won victory over Sparta
through its money and its culture. When you find yourself in conflict with
someone stronger and more rigid, allow them a momentary victory. Seem
to bow to their superiority. Then, by being formless and adaptable, slowly
insinuate yourself into their soul. This way you will catch them off guard,
for rigid people are always ready to ward off direct blows but are helpless
against the subtle and insinuating. To succeed at such a strategy you must
play the chameleon-conform on the surface, while breaking down your
enemy from the inside.
LAW 48 427

[PAGE 452]
For centuries the Japanese would accept foreigners graciously, and ap­
peared susceptible to foreign cultures and influences. Joao Rodriguez, a
Portuguese priest who arrived in Japan in 1577 and lived there far many
years, wrote, "I am flabbergasted by the Japanese willingness to try and ac­
cept everything Portuguese." He saw Japanese in the streets wearing Por­
tuguese clothing, with rosary beads at their necks and crosses at their hips.
This might seem like a weak, mutable culture, but Japan's adaptability
actually protected the country from having an alien culture imposed by
military invasion. It seduced the Portuguese and other Westemers into be­
lieving the Japanese were yielding to a superior culture when actually the
foreign culture's ways were merely a fashion to be donned and doffed.
Under the surface, Japanese culture thrived. Had the Japanese been rigid
about foreign influences and tried to fight them off, they might have suf­
fered the injuries that the West inflicted on China. That is the power of
formlessness-i-t gives the aggressor nothing to react against, nothing to hit.
In evolution, largeness is often the first step toward extinction. What is
immense and bloated has no mobility, but must constantly feed itself. The
unintelligent are often seduced into believing that size connotes power, the
bigger the better.
In 483 B.C., King Xerxes of Persia invaded Greece, believing he could
conquer the country in one easy campaign. After all, he had the largest
army ever assembled for one invasion-the historian Herodotus estimated
it at over more than five million. The Persians planned to build a bridge
across the Hellespont to overrun Greece from the land, while their equally
immense navy would pin the Greek ships in harbor, preventing their
forces from escaping to sea. The plan seemed sure, yet as Xerxes prepared
the invasion, his adviser Artabanus wamed his master of grave misgivings:
"The two mightiest powers in the world are against you," he said. Xerxes
laughed-what powers could match his gigantic army? "I will tell you what
they are," answered Artabanus. "The land and the sea." There were no safe
harbors large enough to receive Xerxes' fleet. And the more land the Per­
sians conquered, and the longer their supply lines stretched, the more ru­
inous the cost of feeding this immense army would prove.
Thinking his adviser a coward, Xerxes proceeded with the invasion.
Yet as Artabanus predicted, bad weather at sea decimated the Persian fleet,
which was too large to take shelter in any harbor. On land, meanwhile, the
Persian army destroyed everything in its path, which only made it impossi­
ble to feed, since the destruction included crops and stores of food. It was
also an easy and slow-moving target. The Greeks practiced all kinds of de­
ceptive maneuvers to disorient the Persians. Xerxes' eventual defeat at the
hands of the Greek allies was an immense disaster. The story is emblematic
of all those who sacrifice mobility for size: The flexible and fleet of foot will
almost always win, for they have more strategie options. The more gigantic
the enemy, the easier it is to induce collapse.
The need for formlessness becomes greater the older we get, as we
grow more likely to become set in our ways and assume too rigid a form.
428 LAW 48

[PAGE 453]
We become predictable, always the first sign of decrepitude. And pre­
dictability makes us appear comica1. Although ridicule and disdain might
seem mild forms of attack, they are actually potent weapons, and will even­
tually erode a foundation of power. An enemy who does not respect you
will grow bold, and boldness makes even the smallest animal dangerous.
The late-eighteenth-century court of France, as exemplified by Marie­
Antoinette, had become so hopelessly tied to a rigid formality that the
average Frenchman thought it a silly relic. This depreciation of a centuries­
old institution was the first sign of a terminal disease, for it represented a
symbolic loosening of the people's ties to monarchy. As the situation wors­
ened, Marie-Antoinette and King Louis XVI grew only more rigid in their
adherence to the past-and quickened their path to the guillotine. King
Charles I of England reacted similarly to the tide of democratic change
brewing in England in the 1630s: He disbanded Parliament, and his court
rituals grew increasingly formal and distant. He wanted to return to an
older style of ruling, with adherence to all kinds of petty protoco1. His
rigidity only heightened the desire for change. So on, of course, he was
swept up in a devastating civil war, and eventually he lost his head to the
executioner's axe.
As you get older, you must rely even less on the past. Be vigilant lest
the form your character has taken makes you seem a relic. It is not a matter
of mimicking the fashions of youth-that is equally worthy of laughter.
Rather your mind must constantly adapt to each circumstance, even the in­
evitable change that the time has come to move over and let those of
younger age prepare for their ascendancy. Rigidity will only make you
look uncannily like a cadaver.
Never forget, though, that formlessness is a strategie pose. It gives you
room to create tactical surprises; as your enemies struggle to guess your
next move, they reveal their own strategy, putting them at a decided disad­
vantage. It keeps the initiative on your side, putting your enemies in the
position of never acting, constantly reacting. It foils their spying and intelli­
gence. Remember: Formlessness is a too1. Never confuse it with a go-with­
the-flow style, or with a religious resignation to the twists of fortune. You
use formlessness, not because it creates inner harmony and peace, but be­
cause it will increase your power.
Finally, learning to adapt to each new circumstance me ans seeing
events through your own eyes, and often ignoring the advice that people
constantly peddle your way. It means that ultimately you must throw out
the laws that others preach, and the books they write to tell you what to do,
and the sage advice of the eIder. "The laws that govern circumstances are
abolished by new circumstances," Napoleon wrote, which means that it is
up to you to gauge each new situation. Rely too much on other people's
ideas and you end up taking a form not of your own making. Too much re­
spect for other people's wisdom will make you depreciate your own. Be
brutal with the past, especially your own, and have no respect for the
philosophies that are foisted on you from outside.
LAW 48 429

Image: Mercury. The winged messenger,
god of commerce, patron saint of thieves,
gambIers, and all those who deceive through
swiftness. The day Mercury was born he invented
the lyre; by that evening he had stolen the cattle of
Apollo. He would scour the world, assuming
whatever form he desired. Like the liquid metal
named after him, he embodies the elusive,
the ungraspable-the power of formlessness.
Authority: Therefore the consummation of forming an army is to arrive
at formlessness. Victory in war is not repetitious, but adapts its form
endlessly. . . . A military force has no constant formation, water has no
constant shape: The ability to gain victory by changing and adapting ac­
cording to the opponent is called genius. (Sun-tzu, fourth century B.C.)
REVERSAL
Using space to disperse and create an abstract pattern should not mean for­
saking the concentration of your power when it is valuable to you. Form­
lessness makes your enemies hunt all over for you, scattering their own
forces, mental as weIl as physical. When you finally engage them, though,
hit them with a powerful, concentrated blow. That is how Mao succeeded
against the NationaHsts: He broke their forces into small, isolated units,
which he then could easily overwhelm with a strong attack. The law of con­
centration prevailed.
When you play with formlessness, keep on top of the process, and
keep your long-term strategy in mind. When you assume a form and go on
the attack, use concentration, speed, and power. As Mao said, "fVhen we
fight you, we make sure you can't get away."
