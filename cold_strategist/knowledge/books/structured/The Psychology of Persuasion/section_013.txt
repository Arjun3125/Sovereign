1. The Canadian election study was reported by Efran and Patterson
(1976). Data of this sort give credence to the claim of some Richard
Nixon backers that the failure that contributed most to the loss of the
1960 TV debates with John F. Kennedy—and thereby to the elec-
tion—was the poor performance of Nixon’s makeup man.
2. See Mack and Rainey (1990).
3. This finding—that attractive defendants, even when they are found
guilty, are less likely to be sentenced to prison—helps explain one of
the more fascinating experiments in criminology I have heard of (Kur-
tzburg et al., 1968). Some New York City jail inmates with facial disfig-
urements were given plastic surgery while incarcerated; others with
similar disfigurements were not. Furthermore, some of each of these
two groups of criminals were given services (for example, counseling

and training) designed to rehabilitate them to society. One year after
their release, a check of the records revealed that (except for heroin
addicts) those given the cosmetic surgery were significantly less likely
to have returned to jail. The most interesting feature of this finding was
that it was equally true for those criminals who had not received the
traditional rehabilitative services as for those who had. Apparently,
some criminologists then argued, when it comes to ugly inmates, prisons
would be better off to abandon the costly rehabilitation treatments they
typically provide and offer plastic surgery instead; the surgery seems
to be at least as effective and decidedly less expensive.
The importance of the newer, Pennsylvania data (Stewart, 1980) is
its suggestion that the argument for surgery as a means of rehabilitation
may be faulty. Making an ugly criminal more attractive may not reduce
the chances that he will commit another crime; it may only reduce his
chances of being sent to jail for it.
4. The negligence-award study was done by Kulka and Kessler (1978),
the helping study by Benson et al. (1976), and the persuasion study by
Chaiken (1979).
5. An excellent review of this research is provided by Eagly et al.
(1991).
6. The dime-request experiment was conducted by Emswiller et al.
(1971), while the petition-signing experiment was done by Suedfeld et
al. (1971).
7. The insurance sales data were reported by Evans (1963). The
“mirroring and matching” evidence comes from work by LaFrance
(1985), Locke and Horowitz (1990), and Woodside and Davenport (1974).
Additional work suggests yet another reason for caution when dealing
with similar requesters: We typically underestimate the degree to which
similarity affects our liking for another (Gonzales et al., 1983).
8. See Drachman et al. (1978) for a complete description of the find-
ings.
9. Bornstein (1989) summarizes much of this evidence.
10. The mirror study was performed by Mita et al. (1977).
11. For general evidence regarding the positive effect of familiarity
on attraction, see Zajonc (1968). For more specific evidence of this effect
on our response to politicians, the research of Joseph Grush is enlight-
ening and sobering (Grush et al., 1978; Grush, 1980), in documenting a
strong connection between amount of media exposure and a candidate’s
chances of winning an election.
12. See Bornstein, Leone, and Galley (1987).
13. For an especially thorough examination of this issue, see Stephan
(1978).
14. The evidence of the tendency of ethnic groups to stay with their

own in school comes from Gerard and Miller (1975). The evidence for
the dislike of things repeatedly presented under unpleasant conditions
comes from such studies as Burgess and Sales (1971), Zajonc et al. (1974),
and Swap (1977).
15. From Aronson (1975).
16. A fascinating description of the entire boys’-camp project, called
the “Robbers’ Cave Experiment,” can be found in Sherif et al. (1961).
17. The Carlos example comes once again from Aronson’s initial report
in his 1975 article. However, additional reports by Aronson and by
others have shown similarly encouraging results. A representative list
would include Johnson and Johnson (1983), DeVries and Slavin (1978),
Cook (1990), and Aronson, Bridgeman, and Geffner (1978a, b).
18. For a careful examination of the possible pitfalls of cooperative
learning approaches, see Rosenfield and Stephan (1981).
19. In truth, little in the way of combat takes place when the salesman
enters the manager’s office under such circumstances. Often, because
the salesman knows exactly the price below which he cannot go, he
and the boss don’t even speak. In one car dealership I infiltrated while
researching this book, it was common for a salesman to have a soft
drink or cigarette in silence while the boss continued working at his
desk. After a seemly time, the salesman would loosen his tie and return
to his customers, looking weary but carrying the deal he had just
“hammered out” for them—the same deal he had in mind before enter-
ing the boss’s office.
20. For experimental evidence of the validity of Shakespeare’s obser-
vation, see Manis et al. (1974).
21. A review of research supporting this statement is provided by
Lott and Lott (1965).
22. See the study by Miller et al. (1966) for evidence.
23. The study was done by Smith and Engel (1968).
24. The rights to such associations don’t come cheaply. Corporate
sponsors spend millions to secure Olympic sponsorships, and they
spend many millions more to advertise their connections to the event.
Yet it may all be worth the expense. An Advertising Age survey found
that one third of all consumers said they would be more likely to pur-
chase a product if it were linked to the Olympics.
25. The Georgia study was done by Rosen and Tesser (1970).
26. From Asimov (1975).
27. Both the sweatshirt and the pronoun experiments are reported
fully in Cialdini et al. (1976).
