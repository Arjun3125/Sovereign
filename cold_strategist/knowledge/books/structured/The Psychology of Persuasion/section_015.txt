1. The home-insulation study was done by Gonzales, Costanzo, and
Aronson (1988) in northern California; the breast-examination work
was conducted by Meyerwitz and Chaiken (1987) in New York City.

2. See Schwartz (1980) for evidence of such a process.
3. See Lynn (1989). Without wishing to minimize the advantages of
this type of shortcut or the dangers associated with it, I should note
that these advantages and dangers are essentially the same ones we
have examined in previous chapters. Accordingly, I will not focus on
this theme in the remainder of the present chapter, except to say at this
point that the key to using properly the shortcut feature of scarcity is
to be alert to the distinction between naturally occurring, honest scarcity
and the fabricated variety favored by certain compliance practitioners.
4. The original reactance-theory formulation appeared in Brehm
(1966); a subsequent version appears in Brehm and Brehm (1981).
5. Brehm and Weintraub (1977) did the barrier experiment. It should
be noted that two-year-old girls in the study did not show the same
resistant response to the large barrier as did the boys. This does not
seem to be because girls don’t oppose attempts to limit their freedoms.
Instead, it appears that they are primarily reactant to restrictions that
come from other people rather than from physical barriers (Brehm,
1983).
6. For descriptions of the two-year-old’s change in self-perception,
see Mahler et al. (1975), Lewis and Brooks-Gunn (1979), Brooks-Gun
and Lewis (1982), and Levine (1983).
7. The occurrence of the Romeo and Juliet effect should not be inter-
preted as a warning to parents to be always accepting of their teenagers’
romantic choices. New players at this delicate game are likely to err
often and, consequently, would benefit from the direction of an adult
with greater perspective and experience. In providing such direction,
parents should recognize that teenagers, who see themselves as young
adults, will not respond well to control attempts that are typical of
parent-child relationships. Especially in the clearly adult arena of mat-
ing, adult tools of influence (preference and persuasion) will be more
effective than traditional forms of parental control (prohibitions and
punishments). Although the experience of the Montague and Capulet
families is an extreme example, heavy-handed restrictions on a young
romantic alliance may well turn it clandestine, torrid, and sad.
A full description of the Colorado couples study can be found in
Driscoll et al. (1972).
8. See Mazis (1975) and Mazis et al. (1973) for formal reports of the
phosphate study.
9. For evidence, see Ashmore et al. (1971), Wicklund and Brehm
(1974), Worchel and Arnold (1973), Worchel et al. (1975), and Worchel
(1991).
10. The Purdue study was done by Zellinger et al. (1974).

11. The University of Chicago jury experiment on inadmissible
evidence was reported by Broeder (1959).
12. The initial statements of commodity theory appeared in Brock
(1968) and Fromkin and Brock (1971). For an updated statement, see
Brock and Bannon (1992).
13. For ethical reasons, the information provided to the customers
was always true. There was an impending beef shortage and this news
had, indeed, come to the company through its exclusive sources. See
Knishinsky (1982) for full details of the project.
14. Worchel et al. (1975).
15. See Davies (1962, 1969).
16. See Lytton (1979), and Rosenthal and Robertson (1959).
17. The quote comes from MacKenzie (1974).

1. For evidence of such perceptual and decisional narrowing see
Berkowitz (1967), Bodenhausen (1990), Cohen (1978), Easterbrook (1959),
Gilbert and Osborn (1989), Hockey and Hamilton (1970), Mackworth
(1965), Milgram (1970), and Tversky and Kahnemann (1974).
2. Quoted in the PBS-TV documentary The Information Society.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
An array of people deserve and have my appreciation for their aid in
making this book possible. Several of my academic colleagues read and
provided perceptive comments on the entire manuscript in its initial
draft form, greatly strengthening the subsequent version. They are Gus
Levine, Doug Kenrick, Art Beaman, and Mark Zanna. In addition, the
first draft was read by a few family members and friends—Richard and
Gloria Cialdini, Bobette Gorden, and Ted Hall—who offered not only
much-needed emotional support but insightful substantive commentary
as well.
A second, larger group provided helpful suggestions for selected
chapters or groups of chapters: Todd Anderson, Sandy Braver, Catherine
Chambers, Judy Cialdini, Nancy Eisenberg, Larry Ettkin, Joanne Gersten,
Jeff Goldstein, Betsy Hans, Valerie Hans, Joe Hepworth, Holly Hunt,
Ann Inskeep, Barry Leshowitz, Darwyn Linder, Debbie Littler, John
Mowen, Igor Pavlov, Janis Posner, Trish Puryear, Marilyn Rall, John
Reich, Peter Reingen, Diane Ruble, Phyllis Sensenig, Roman Sherman,
and Henry Wellman.
Certain people were instrumental at the beginning stages. John Staley
was the first publishing professional to recognize the project’s potential.
Jim Sherman, Al Goethals, John Keating, and Dan Wegner provided
early, positive reviews that encouraged author and editors alike. William
Morrow and Company’s then president, Larry Hughes, sent a small
but enthusiastic note that fortified me importantly for the task that lay
ahead. Last and hardly least, Maria Guarnaschelli believed with me
from the start in the book I wanted to write. It is to her editorial credit
that the finished product remains that book, much improved. For her
insightful direction and her potent efforts in the book’s behalf, I am
most grateful.
In addition, I would be remiss if I did not recognize the skill and effi-
ciency of Sally Carney at manuscript preparation and the sound counsel
of my attorney, Robert Brandes.
Finally, throughout the project, no one was more on my side than
Bobette Gorden, who lived every word with me.
