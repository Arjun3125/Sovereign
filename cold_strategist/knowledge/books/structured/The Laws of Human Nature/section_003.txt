chapter 18.) It cannot be put into words. It is too awesome.
Feeling a part of that tenuous experiment of life is a kind of reverse
grandiosity—you are not disturbed by your relative smallness but
rather ecstatic at the sense of being a drop in this ocean.
Then, overwhelmed by the afflictions I suffered in connection with my sons,
I sent again and inquired of the god what I should do to pass the rest of my
life most happily; and he answered me: “Knowing thyself, O Croesus—thus
shall you live and be happy.” . . . [But] spoiled by the wealth I had and by
those who were begging me to become their leader, by the gifts they gave
me and by the people who flattered me, saying that if I would consent to
take command they would all obey me and I should be the greatest of men
—puffed up by such words, when all the princes round about chose me to be
their leader in the war, I accepted the command, deeming myself fit to be
the greatest; but, as it seems, I did not know myself. For I thought I was
capable of carrying on war against you; but I was no match for you. . . .
Therefore, as I was thus without knowledge, I have my just deserts.

Reconnect to the Masculine or
Feminine Within You
The Law of Gender Rigidity
All of us have masculine and feminine qualities—some of this is
genetic, and some of it comes from the profound influence of the
parent of the opposite sex. But in the need to present a consistent
identity in society, we tend to repress these qualities, overidentifying
with the masculine or feminine role expected of us. And we pay a
price for this. We lose valuable dimensions to our character. Our
thinking and ways of acting become rigid. Our relationships with
members of the opposite sex suffer as we project onto them our own
fantasies and hostilities. You must become aware of these lost
masculine or feminine traits and slowly reconnect to them,
unleashing creative powers in the process. You will become more fluid
in your thinking. In bringing out the masculine or feminine undertone
to your character, you will fascinate people by being authentically
yourself. Do not play the expected gender role, but rather create the
one that suits you.
The Authentic Gender
As a young girl, Caterina Sforza dreamed of great deeds that she would
be a part of as a member of the illustrious Sforza family of Milan. Born
in 1463, Caterina was the daughter out of wedlock of a beautiful
Milanese noblewoman and Galeazzo Maria Sforza, who became Duke
of Milan upon the death of his father in 1466. As duke, Galeazzo
ordered that his daughter be brought into the castle, Porta Giovia,
where he lived with his new wife, and that she be raised like any
legitimate member of the Sforza family. His wife, Caterina’s

[PAGE 354]
stepmother, treated her as one of her own. The girl was to have the
finest education. The man who had served as Galeazzo’s tutor, the
famous humanist Francesco Filelfo, would now serve as Caterina’s
tutor. He taught her Latin, Greek, philosophy, the sciences, and even
military history.
Often alone, Caterina would wander almost daily into the vast castle
library, one of the largest in Europe. She had her favorite books that
she would read over and over. One of these was a history of the Sforza
family, written by Filelfo himself in the style of Homer. There, in this
enormous volume with its elaborate illustrations, she would read about
the remarkable rise to power of the Sforza family, from condottiere
(captains in mercenary armies) to ruling the duchy of Milan itself. The
Sforzas were renowned for their cleverness and bravery in battle.
Along with this, she loved to read books that recounted the chivalric
tales of real-life knights in armor, and the stories of great leaders in the
past; among these, one of her favorites was Illustrious Women by
Boccaccio, which related the deeds of the most celebrated women in
history. And as she whiled away her time in the library, all of these
books converging in her mind, she would daydream about the future
glory of the family, somehow herself in the midst of it all. And at the
center of these fantasies was the image of her father, a man who to her
was as great and legendary as anyone she had read about.
Although the encounters with her father were often brief, to
Caterina they were intense. He treated her as an equal, marveling at
her intelligence and encouraging her in her studies. From early on, she
identified with her father—experiencing his traumas and triumphs as if
they were her own. As were all the Sforza children, girls included,
Caterina was taught sword fighting and underwent rigorous physical
training. As part of this side of her education, she would go on hunting
expeditions with the family in the nearby woods of Pavia. She was
trained to hunt and kill wild boars, stags, and other animals. On these
excursions she would watch her father with awe. He was a superior
horseman, riding with such impetuosity, as if nothing could harm him.
In the hunt, taking on the largest animals, he showed no signs of fear.
At court, he was the consummate diplomat yet always maintained the
upper hand. He confided in her his methods—think ahead, plot several
moves in advance, always with the goal of seizing the initiative in any
situation.

[PAGE 355]
There was another side to her father, however, that deepened her
identification with him. He loved spectacle; he was like an artist. She
would never forget the time the family toured the region and visited
Florence. They brought with them various theater troupes, the actors
wearing outlandish costumes. They dined in the country inside the
most beautifully colored tents. On the march, the brightly caparisoned
horses and the accompanying soldiers—all decked in the Sforza colors,
scarlet and white—would fill the landscape. It was a hypnotic and
thrilling sight, all orchestrated by her father. He delighted in always
wearing the latest in Milanese fashions, with his elaborate and
bejeweled silk gowns. She came to share this interest, clothes and
jewels becoming her passion. He might seem so virile in battle, but she
would see him crying like a baby as he listened to his favorite choral
music. He had an endless appetite for all aspects of life, and her love
and admiration for him knew no bounds.
And so in 1473, when her father informed the ten-year-old Caterina
of the marriage he had arranged for her, her only thought was to fulfill
her duty as a Sforza and please her father. The man Galeazzo had
chosen for her was Girolamo Riario, the thirty-year-old nephew of
Pope Sixtus IV, a marriage that would forge a valuable alliance
between Rome and Milan. As part of the arrangement, the pope
purchased the city of Imola, in Romagna, which the Sforzas had taken
decades before, christening the new couple the Count and Countess of
Imola. Later the pope would add the nearby town of Forlì to their
possessions, giving them control of a very strategically located part of
northeastern Italy, just south of Venice.
In her initial encounters with him, Caterina’s husband seemed a
most unpleasant man. He was moody, self-absorbed, and high-strung.
He appeared interested in her only for sex and could not wait for her to
come of age. Fortunately, he continued to live in Rome and she stayed
in Milan. But a few years later some disgruntled noblemen in Milan
murdered her beloved father, and the power of the Sforzas seemed in
jeopardy. Her position as the marriage pawn solidifying the
partnership with Rome was now more important than ever. She
quickly installed herself in Rome. There she would have to play the
exemplary wife and keep on the good side of her husband. But the
more she saw of Girolamo, the less she respected him. He was a
hothead, making enemies wherever he turned. She had not imagined

[PAGE 356]
that a man could be so weak, and compared with her father he failed by
every measure.
She turned her attention to the pope. She worked hard to gain his
favor and that of his courtiers. Caterina was now a beautiful young
woman with blond hair, a novelty in Rome. She ordered the most
elaborate gowns to be sent from Milan. She made sure to never be seen
wearing the same outfit twice. If she sported a turban with a long veil,
it suddenly became the latest craze. She reveled in the attention she
received as the most fashionable woman in Rome, Botticelli using her
as a model for some of his greatest paintings. Being so well read and
cultivated, she was the delight of the artists and writers in town, and
the Romans began to warm up to her.
Within a few years, however, everything unraveled. Her husband
instigated a feud with one of the leading families in Italy, the Colonnas.
Then in 1484 the pope suddenly died, and without his protection
Caterina and her husband were in grave danger. The Colonnas were
plotting their revenge. The Romans hated Girolamo. And it was almost
a certainty that the new pope would be a friend of the Colonnas, in
which case Caterina and her husband would lose everything, including
the towns of Forlì and Imola. Considering the weak position of her own
family in Milan, the situation began to look desperate.
Until a new pope was elected, Girolamo was still the captain of the
papal armies, now stationed just outside Rome. For days Caterina
watched her husband, who was paralyzed with fear and unable to make
a decision. He dared not enter Rome, fearing battle with the Colonnas
and their many allies in the crowded streets. He would wait it out, but
with time their options seemed to narrow, and the news kept getting
worse—mobs had sacked the palace they lived in; what few allies they
had in Rome had now deserted them; the cardinals were congregating
to elect the new pope.
It was August and the sweltering heat made Caterina—seven
months pregnant with her fourth child—feel faint and continually
nauseated. But as she contemplated the impending doom, the thought
of her father began to occupy her mind; it was as if she could feel his
spirit inhabiting her. Thinking as he would think about the
predicament she faced, she felt a rush of excitement as she formulated
an audacious plan. Without telling a soul of her intentions, in the dark

[PAGE 357]
of night she mounted a horse and snuck out of camp, riding as fast as
she could to Rome.
As she had expected, in her condition no one recognized her and
she was allowed to enter the city. She headed straight for the Castel
Sant’Angelo, the most strategic point in Rome—just across the Tiber
River from the city center and close to the Vatican. With its
impregnable walls and its cannons that could be aimed at all parts of
Rome, the person who controlled the castle controlled the city. Rome
was in tumult, mobs filling the streets everywhere. The castle was still
held by a lieutenant loyal to Girolamo. Identifying herself, Caterina
was let into Sant’Angelo.
Once inside, in the name of her husband she took possession of the
castle, throwing out the lieutenant, whom she did not trust. Sending
word out through the castle to soldiers who swore loyalty to her, she
managed to smuggle in more troops. With the cannons of Sant’Angelo
now pointing at all roads leading to the Vatican, she made it
impossible for the cardinals to meet in one location and elect the new
pope. To make her threats real, she had her soldiers fire the cannons as
a warning. She meant business. Her terms for surrendering the castle
were simple—that all of the property of the Riarios be guaranteed to
remain in their hands, including Forlì and Imola.
A few evenings after she had taken over Sant’Angelo, wearing some
armor over her gown, she marched along the ramparts of the castle. It
gave her a feeling of great power, so far above the city, looking down at
the frantic men below, helpless to fight against her, a single woman
hobbled by pregnancy. When an envoy of the cardinal who was
organizing the conclave to elect the new pope was sent to negotiate
with her and seemed reluctant to agree to her conditions of surrender,
she shouted down from the ramparts, so all could hear, “So [the
cardinal] wants a battle of wits with me, does he? What he doesn’t
understand is that I have the brains of Duke Galeazzo and I am as
brilliant as he!”
As she waited for their response, she knew she controlled the
situation. Her only fear was that her husband would surrender and
betray her, or that the August heat would make her too ill to wait it out.
Finally, sensing her resolve, a group of cardinals came to the castle to
negotiate, and they acceded to her demands. The following morning, as
the drawbridge was lowered to let the countess leave the castle, she

[PAGE 358]
noticed an enormous crowd pushing close to her. Romans of all classes
had come to catch a glimpse of the woman who had controlled Rome
for eleven days. They had taken the countess for a rather frivolous
young woman addicted to clothes, the pope’s little pet. Now they stared
at her in astonishment—she was wearing one of her silk gowns, with a
heavy sword dangling from a man’s belt, her pregnancy more than
evident. They had never seen such a sight.
Their titles now secure, the count and countess moved to Forlì to
rule their domain. With no more funds coming from the papacy,
Girolamo’s main concern was how to get more money. And so he
increased the taxes on his subjects, stirring up much discontent in the
process. He quickly made enemies of the powerful Orsi family in the
region. Fearing plots against his life, the count holed himself up in
their palace. Slowly Caterina took over much of the day-to-day ruling
of their realm. Thinking ahead, she installed a trusted ally as the new
commander of the castle Ravaldino, which dominated the area. She did
everything she could to ingratiate herself with the locals, but in a few
short years her husband had done too much damage.
On April 14, 1488, a group of men, clad in armor and led by
Ludovico Orsi, stormed into the palace and stabbed the count to death,
throwing his body out the window and into the city square. The
countess, dining with her family in a nearby room, heard the shouts
and quickly shuffled her six children into a safer room in the palace’s
tower. She bolted the door and from a window, under which several of
her most trusted allies had gathered, she shouted instructions to them:
they were to notify the Sforzas in Milan and her other allies in the
region and urge them to send armies to rescue her; under no
circumstances should the keeper of Ravaldino ever surrender the
castle. Within minutes the assassins had broken into her room, taking
her and her children captive.
Several days later, Ludovico Orsi and his fellow conspirator
Giacomo del Ronche marched Caterina up to Ravaldino—she was to
order the castle’s commander to surrender it to the assassins. As the
commander she had installed, Tommaso Feo, looked down from the
ramparts, Caterina seemed to fear for her life. Her voice breaking with
emotion, she begged Feo to give up the fortress, but he refused.
As the two of them continued their dialogue, Ronche and Orsi
sensed the countess and Feo were playing some sort of game, talking in

[PAGE 359]
code. Ronche had had enough of this. Pressing the sharp edge of his
lance tight against her chest, he threatened to run her through unless
she got Feo to surrender, and he gave her the sternest glare. Suddenly
the countess’s expression changed. She leaned further into the blade,
her face inches from Ronche, and with a voice dripping with disdain,
she told him, “Oh, Giacomo del Ronche, don’t you try to frighten
me. . . . You can hurt me, but you can’t scare me, because I am the
daughter of a man who knew no fear. Do what you want: you have
killed my lord, you can certainly kill me. After all, I’m just a woman!”
Confounded by her words and demeanor, Ronche and Orsi decided
they had to find other means to pressure her.
Several days later Feo communicated with the assassins that he
would indeed hand over the fortress, but only if the countess would
pay him his back wages and sign a letter absolving him of any guilt for
such surrender. Once again, Orsi and Ronche led her to the castle and
watched her closely as she seemed to negotiate with Feo. Finally Feo
insisted that the countess enter the fortress to sign the document. He
feared the assassins were trying to trick him and he insisted she enter
alone. Once the letter was signed, he would do as he had promised.
The conspirators, feeling they had no choice, granted his request
but gave the countess a brief time frame to conclude the business. For
a fleeting moment, just as she disappeared over the drawbridge into
Ravaldino, she turned with a sneer and gave the Italian equivalent of
“the finger” to Ronche and Orsi. The entire drama of the past few days
had been planned and staged by her and Feo, with whom she had
communicated through various messengers. She knew that the
Milanese had sent an army to rescue her and she only had to play for
time. A few hours later Feo stood on the ramparts and yelled down that
he was holding the countess hostage and that was that.
The enraged assassins had had enough. The next day they returned
to the castle with her six children and called Caterina to the ramparts.
With daggers and spears pointed at them in the most menacing
fashion, and with the children wailing and begging for mercy, they
ordered Caterina to surrender the fortress or they would kill them all.
Surely they had already proven they were more than willing to shed
blood. She might be fearless and the daughter of a Sforza, but no
mother could possibly watch her children die before her eyes. Caterina
wasted no time. She shouted down: “Do it then, you fools! I am already
pregnant with another child by Count Riario and I have the means to

[PAGE 360]
make more!” at which she lifted her skirts, as if to emphasize her
meaning.
Caterina had foreseen the maneuver with the children and had
calculated that the assassins were weak and indecisive—they should
have killed her and her family on that first day, amid the mayhem.
Now they would not dare to kill them in cold blood: the assassins knew
that the Sforzas, on their way to Forlì, would take terrible revenge on
them if they ever did such a deed. And if she surrendered now, she and
her children would all be imprisoned, and some poison would find its
way into their food. She didn’t care what they thought of her as a
mother. She had to keep stalling. To emphasize her resolve, after
refusing to surrender, she had the cannons of the castle fire at the Orsi
palace.
Ten days later a Milanese army arrived to rescue her, and the
assassins scattered. The countess was quickly restored to power, the
new pope himself confirming her rule as regent until her eldest son,
Ottaviano, came of age. And as word of all that she had done—and
what she had yelled down to the assassins from the ramparts of
Ravaldino—spread throughout Italy, the legend of Caterina Sforza, the
beautiful warrior countess of Forlì, began to take on a life of its own.
Within a year after the death of her husband, the countess had
taken a lover, Giacomo Feo, the brother of the commander she had
installed in Ravaldino. Giacomo was seven years younger than
Caterina, and he was the polar opposite of Girolamo—handsome and
virile, he had come from the lower classes, having served as the stable
boy to the Riario family. Most important, he not only loved Caterina,
he worshipped her and showered her with attention. The countess had
spent her whole life mastering her emotions and subordinating her
personal interests to practical matters. Suddenly feeling herself
overwhelmed by Giacomo’s affection, she lost her habitual self-control
and fell hopelessly in love.
She made Giacomo the new commander of Ravaldino. As he now
had to live in the castle, she built a palace for herself inside it and soon
barely left its confines. Giacomo was decidedly insecure about his
status. Caterina had him knighted, and in a secret ceremony they
married. To allay his self-doubts, she increasingly handed over to him
governing powers of Forlì and Imola, and began to retire from public
affairs. She ignored the warnings of courtiers and diplomats that

[PAGE 361]
Giacomo was out for himself and was in over his head. She did not
listen to her sons, who feared Giacomo had plans to get rid of them. In
her eyes, her husband could do no wrong. Then one day in 1495, as she
and Giacomo left the castle for a picnic, a group of assassins
surrounded her husband and killed him before her eyes.
Caught off guard by this action, Caterina reacted with fury. She
rounded up the conspirators and had them executed and their families
imprisoned. In the months after this, she fell into a deep depression,
even contemplating suicide. What had happened to her over the past
few years? How had she lost her way and given up her power? What
had happened to her girlhood dreams and the spirit of her father that
was her own? Something had clouded her mind. She turned to religion
and she returned to ruling her realm. Slowly she recovered.
Then one day she received a visit from Giovanni de’ Medici, a thirty-
year-old member of the famous family and one of Florence’s leading
businessmen. He had come to forge commercial ties between the cities.
More than anyone else, he reminded her of her father. He was
handsome, clever, extremely well read, and yet there was a softness to
his character. Finally here was a man who was her equal in knowledge,
power, and refinement. The admiration was mutual. Soon they were
inseparable, and in 1498 they married, uniting two of the most
illustrious families in Italy.
Now she could finally dream of creating a great regional power, but
events beyond her control would spoil her plans. That same year
Giovanni died from illness. And before she had time to grieve for him,
she had to deal with the latest and most dangerous threat of all to her
realm: The new pope, Alexander VI (formerly known as Roderigo
Borgia), had his eye on Forlì. He wanted to extend the papal domains
through conquest, his son Cesare Borgia serving as the commander of
the papal forces. Forlì would be a key acquisition for the pope, and he
began to maneuver to politically isolate Caterina from her allies.
To prepare for the imminent invasion, Caterina forged a new
alliance with the Venetians and built an elaborate series of defenses
within Ravaldino. The pope tried to pressure her to surrender her
domain, making her all kinds of promises in return. She knew better
than to trust a Borgia. But by the fall of 1499, it seemed that the end
had finally come. The pope had allied himself with France, and Cesare
Borgia had appeared in the region with an army of twelve thousand,

[PAGE 362]
fortified by the addition of two thousand experienced French soldiers.
They quickly took Imola and easily entered the city of Forlì itself. All
that remained was Ravaldino, which by late December was surrounded
by Borgia’s troops.
On December 26, Cesare Borgia himself rode up to the castle on his
white horse, dressed all in black—quite a sight. As Caterina looked
down from the ramparts and contemplated the scene, she thought of
her father. It was the anniversary of his assassination. He represented
everything she valued, and she would not disappoint him. She was the
most like him of all his children. As he would have done, she had
thought ahead—her plan was to play for time until her remaining allies
could come to her defense. She had cleverly fortified Ravaldino in a
way that would allow her to keep retreating behind barricades if the
walls were breached. In the end, they would have to take the castle
from her by force, and she was more than prepared to die in defense of
it, sword in hand.
As she listened to Borgia address her, it was clear he had come to
flatter and flirt—everyone knew his reputation as a devilish seducer,
and many in Italy thought Caterina had rather loose morals. She
listened and smiled, occasionally reminding him of her past deeds and
her reputation as a Sforza—if he wanted her to surrender, he would
have to do better. He persisted in his courtship and asked to parley
with her personally.
She appeared to finally succumb to his charm; she was a woman,
after all. She ordered the drawbridge to be lowered and started walking
toward him. He continued to press his case, and she gave him certain
looks and smiles that indicated she was falling under his spell. Now
only inches away, he reached for her arm, and she playfully withdrew
it. They should discuss matters in the castle, she said with a coy
expression, and began to walk back, inviting him to follow. As he
stepped onto the drawbridge to catch up with her, it began to rise, and
he leaped back to the other side just in time. Enraged and embarrassed
by the trick she had tried to play, he swore revenge.
During the next few days he unleashed a torrent of cannon fire at
the castle walls, finally opening a breach. Borgia’s troops flooded in,
led by the more experienced French. It was now hand-to-hand combat,
and at the front of her remaining troops was Caterina. The head of the
French troops, Yves d’Allegre, stared at her in amazement as the

[PAGE 363]
beautiful countess—her ornamented cuirass over her dress—charged at
his men from the front line, handling her sword deftly, without a trace
of fear.
She and her men were about to withdraw further into the castle,
hoping to prolong the battle for days, as she had planned, when one of
her own soldiers grabbed her from behind and, his sword at her throat,
marched her over to the other side. Borgia had put a price on her head,
and the soldier had betrayed her for the reward. The siege was over,
and Borgia himself took possession of his great prize. That night he
raped her and kept her confined in his rooms, trying to make it seem to
the world that the infamous warrior countess had willingly succumbed
to his charms.
Even under duress she refused to sign away her domain, and so she
was brought to Rome and soon thrown into the dreaded prison at
Castel Sant’Angelo. For one long year, in a small and windowless cell,
she endured her loneliness and the endless tortures devised by the
Borgias. Her health deteriorated and she seemed destined to die in
prison, defiant to the end, but the chivalric French captain Yves
d’Allegre had fallen under her spell. He persisted in demanding, in the
name of the French king, to have her freed, and he finally succeeded,
getting her safe passage to Florence.
In retirement from public life, Caterina began to receive letters from
men from all parts of Europe. Some had seen her over the years; most
had only heard of her. They obsessed over her story, confessed their
love, and begged for some memento, some relic to worship. One man
who had caught a glimpse of her when she had first come to Rome
wrote to her, “If I sleep, it seems that I am with you; if I eat, I leave my
food and talk to you. . . . You are engraved in my heart.”
Weakened by her year in prison, the countess died in 1509.
• • •
Interpretation: In Caterina Sforza’s time, the roles that a woman
could play were severely restricted. Her primary role was to be the
good mother and wife, but if unmarried, she could devote her life to
religion, or in rare cases she could become a courtesan. It was as if a
circle had been drawn around each and every woman, and she dared
not explore beyond that circle. It was in a woman’s earliest years and
education that she internalized these restrictions. If she studied only a

[PAGE 364]
limited number of subjects and practiced only certain skills, she
couldn’t expand her role even if she wanted to. Knowledge was power.
Caterina stands out as a remarkable exception, and it was because
she benefited from a unique confluence of circumstances. The Sforzas
were new to power. They had discovered in their rise to the top that a
strong and capable wife could be of great assistance. They developed
the practice of training their daughters in hunting and sword fighting
as a way to toughen them up and make them fearless—important
qualities to have as marriage pawns. Caterina’s father, however, took
this further. Perhaps he saw in his daughter a female reflection of
himself. Giving her his own tutor signaled some sort of identification
he felt between them.
And so a unique experiment began in the castle at Porta Giovia.
Isolated from the outside world and allowed a tremendous degree of
freedom, Caterina could develop herself in any direction she desired.
Intellectually she could explore all forms of knowledge. She could
indulge herself in all of her natural interests—in her case, fashion and
the arts. In her physical training, she could give free rein to her own
bold and adventurous spirit. In this early education, she could bring
out the many different sides of her character.
And so when she entered public life at the age of ten, she naturally
drifted beyond that restricted circle imposed on women. She could play
many roles. As a dutiful Sforza, she could be the loyal wife. Naturally
empathetic and caring, she could be the devoted mother. She felt great
pleasure in being the most fashionable and beautiful young woman at
the papal court. But when the actions of her husband appeared to
doom her and her family, she felt herself called to play another role.
Trained to think for herself and inspired by her father, she could turn
into the daring soldier, bringing an entire city under her control. She
could become the keen strategist, plotting several moves ahead in a
crisis. She could lead her troops, sword in hand. As a young girl she
had fantasized about playing these various roles, and it felt natural and
deeply satisfying to do so in real life.
We could say of Caterina that she had a feminine spirit with a
pronounced masculine undertone, the reverse of her father. And these
feminine and masculine traits were blended together, giving her a
unique style of thinking and acting. When it came to ruling, she
displayed a high degree of empathy, something quite unusual for the

[PAGE 365]
time. When plague struck Forlì, she comforted the sick, at great risk to
her own life. She was willing to suffer the worst conditions in prison to
safeguard the inheritance for her children, a rare act of self-sacrifice
for a person of power. But at the same time she was a shrewd and
tough negotiator, and she had no tolerance for the incompetent or the
weak. She was ambitious and proud of it.
In conflicts, she always strategized to outwit her aggressive male
opponents and avoid bloodshed. With Cesare Borgia, she tried to lure
him onto the drawbridge using her feminine wiles; later, she tried to
lure him deeper and deeper into the castle, trapping him in a
protracted battle, giving her allies plenty of time to rescue her. She
nearly succeeded in both efforts.
This ability to play many different roles, to blend the masculine
with the feminine, was the source of her power. The only time she
relinquished this was in her marriage to Giacomo Feo. When she fell in
love with Feo, she was in a highly vulnerable position. The pressures
on her had been immense—dealing with a hopeless and abusive
husband, surviving the numerous pregnancies that had worn her
down, holding together the tenuous political alliances she had built up.
And so suddenly experiencing Feo’s adoring attention, it was natural
for her to seek a respite from her burdens, to relinquish power and
control for love. But in narrowing herself down to the role of the
devoted wife, she had to repress her naturally expansive character. She
had to expend her energy in placating her husband’s insecurities. In
the process she lost all initiative and paid the price, experiencing a
deep depression that nearly killed her. She learned her lesson and
afterward would remain true to herself for the rest of her life.
Perhaps what is most surprising about the story of Caterina Sforza
is the effect she had on the men and women of her time. We would
expect that people would have condemned her as a witch or virago and
shunned her for all her flouting of gender conventions. Instead, she
fascinated almost everyone who came in contact with her. Women
admired her strength. Isabella d’Este, the ruler of Mantua and her
contemporary, found her inspiring and wrote after her capture by
Borgia, “If the French criticize the cowardliness of our men, at least
they should praise the daring and valor of the Italian woman.” Men of
all types—artists, soldiers, priests, nobility, servants—obsessed over
her. Even those who wanted to destroy her, like Cesare Borgia, felt an
initial attraction and the desire to possess her.

[PAGE 366]
Men could talk battle and strategy with her and feel like they were
talking to an equal, not like the other women in their lives, with whom
they could barely converse. But more important, they sensed a freedom
in her that was exciting. They also had to play a gender role, one that
was not as constricting as a woman’s role but had its disadvantages.
They were expected to be always in control, tough and indomitable.
Secretly they were drawn to this dangerous woman with whom they
could lose control. She was not a feminine doll, all passive and existing
only to please men. She was unrepressed and authentic, which inspired
in them the desire to let go as well, to move past their own constricted
roles.
Understand: You might like to imagine that much has changed
when it comes to gender roles, that the world of Caterina Sforza is too
distant from our own to be relevant. But in thinking so you would be
greatly mistaken. The specific details of gender roles might fluctuate
according to culture and time period, but the pattern is essentially the
same and is as follows: We are all born as complete beings, with many
sides to us. We have qualities of the opposite sex, both genetically and
from the influence of the parent of the other gender. Our character has
natural depths and dimensions to it. When it comes to boys, studies
have shown that an early age they are actually more emotionally
reactive than girls. They have high degrees of empathy and sensitivity.
Girls have an adventurous and exploratory spirit that is natural to
them. They have powerful wills, which they like to exert in
transforming their environment.
As we get older, however, we have to present to the world a
consistent identity. We have to play certain roles and live up to certain
expectations. We have to trim and lop off natural qualities. Boys lose
their rich range of emotions and, in the struggle to get ahead, repress
their natural empathy. Girls have to sacrifice their assertive sides. They
are supposed to be nice, smiling, deferential, always considering other
people’s feelings before their own. A woman can be a boss, but she
must be tender and pliant, never too aggressive.
In this process, we become less and less dimensional; we conform
to the expected roles of our culture and time period. We lose valuable
and rich parts to our character. Sometimes we can realize this only
when we encounter those who are less repressed and we feel
fascination with them. Certainly Caterina Sforza had such an effect.
There are also many male counterparts to this in history—the

[PAGE 367]
nineteenth-century British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, Duke
Ellington, John F. Kennedy, David Bowie, all men who displayed an
unmistakable feminine undertone and intrigued people all the more
for this.
Your task is to let go of the rigidity that takes hold of you as you
overidentify with the expected gender role. Power lies in exploring that
middle range between the masculine and the feminine, in playing
against people’s expectations. Return to the harder or softer sides of
your character that you have lost or repressed. In relating to people,
expand your repertoire by developing greater empathy, or by learning
to be less deferential. When confronting a problem or resistance from
others, train yourself to respond in different ways—attacking when you
normally defend, or vice versa. In your thinking, learn to blend the
analytical with the intuitive in order to become more creative (see the
final section of this chapter for more on this).
Do not be afraid to bring out the more sensitive or ambitious sides
to your character. These repressed parts of you are yearning to be let
out. In the theater of life, expand the roles that you play. Don’t worry
about people’s reactions to any changes in you they sense. You are not
so easy to categorize, which will fascinate them and give you the power
to play with their perceptions of you, altering them at will.
It is the terrible deception of love that it begins by engaging us in play not
with a woman of the external world but with a doll fashioned in our brain—
the only woman moreover that we have always at our disposal, the only one
we shall ever possess.
—Marcel Proust
Keys to Human Nature
We humans like to believe that we are consistent and mature, and that
we have reasonable control over our lives. We make decisions based on
rational considerations, on what will benefit us the most. We have free
will. We know who we are, more or less. But in one particular aspect of
life these self-opinions are all easily shattered—when we fall in love.
When in love, we become prey to emotions we cannot control. We
make choices of partners we cannot rationally explain, and often these
choices end up being unfortunate. Many of us will have at least one
successful relationship in our lives, but we will tend to have many more
that were decidedly unsuccessful, that ended unhappily. And often we

[PAGE 368]
repeat the same types of bad choices of partners, as if compelled by
some inner demon.
We like to tell ourselves in retrospect that when we were in love, a
type of temporary madness overcame us. We think of such moments as
representing the exception, not the rule, to our character. But let us
entertain for the moment the opposite possibility—in our conscious
day-to-day life, we are sleepwalking, unaware of who we really are; we
present a front of reasonableness to the world, and we mistake the
mask for reality. When we fall in love, we are actually being more
ourselves. The mask slips off. We realize then how deeply unconscious
forces determine many of our actions. We are more connected to the
reality of the essential irrationality in our nature.
Let us look at some of the common changes that occur when we are
in love.
Normally our minds are in a state of distraction. The deeper we fall
in love, however, the more our attention is completely absorbed in one
person. We become obsessive.
We like to present a particular appearance to the world, one that
highlights our strengths. When in love, however, opposite traits often
come to the fore. A person who is normally strong and independent
can suddenly become rather helpless, dependent, and hysterical. A
nurturing, empathetic person can suddenly become tyrannical,
demanding, and self-absorbed.
As adults we feel relatively mature and practical, but in love we can
suddenly regress to behavior that can only be seen as childish. We
experience fears and insecurities that are greatly exaggerated. We feel
terror at the thought of being abandoned, like a baby who has been left
alone for a few minutes. We have wild mood swings—from love to hate,
from trust to paranoia.
Normally we like to imagine that we are good judges of other
people’s character. Once infatuated or in love, however, we mistake the
narcissist for a genius, the suffocator for a nurturer, the slacker for the
exciting rebel, the control freak for the protector. Others can often see
the truth and try to disabuse us of our fantasies, but we won’t listen.
And what is worse, we will often continue to make the same types of
mistaken judgments again and again.

[PAGE 369]
In looking at these altered states, we might be tempted to describe
them as forms of possession. We are normally rational person A, but
under the influence of an infatuation, irrational person B begins to
emerge. At first, A and B can fluctuate and even blend into each other,
but the deeper we fall in love, the more it is person B who dominates.
Person B sees qualities in people that are not there, acts in ways that
are counterproductive and even self-destructive, is quite immature,
with unrealistic expectations, and makes decisions that are often
mysterious later on to person A.
When it comes to our behavior in these situations, we never really
completely understand what is happening. Too much of our
unconscious is at play, and we have no rational access to its processes.
But the eminent psychologist Carl Jung—who analyzed over the course
of his very long career thousands of men and women with stories of
painful love affairs—offered perhaps the most profound explanation
for what happens to us when we fall in love. According to Jung, we are
actually possessed in such moments. He gave the entity (person B) that
takes hold of us the name anima (for the male) and animus (for the
female). This entity exists in our unconscious but comes to the surface
when a person of the opposite sex fascinates us. The following is the
origin of the anima and the animus, and how they operate.
We all possess hormones and genes of the opposite sex. These
contrasexual traits are in the minority (to a greater or lesser extent,
depending on the individual), but they are within us all and they form
a part of our character. Equally significant is the influence on our
psyche of the parent of the opposite sex, from whom we absorb
feminine or masculine traits.
In our earliest years we were completely open and susceptible to the
influence of others. The parent of the opposite sex was our first
encounter with someone dramatically different from us. As we related
to their alien nature, much of our personality was formed in response,
becoming more dimensional and multifaceted. (With the parent of the
same sex there is often a level of comfort and immediate identification
that does not require the same adaptive energy).
For instance, small boys are often comfortable expressing emotions
and traits that they’ve learned from the mother, such as overt affection,
empathy, and sensitivity. Small girls, conversely, are often comfortable
expressing traits they’ve learned from the father, such as aggression,

[PAGE 370]
boldness, intellectual rigor, and physical prowess. Each child may also
naturally possess these opposite-gender traits in him- or herself. In
addition, each parent will also have a shadow side that the child must
assimilate or deal with. For instance, a mother may be narcissistic
rather than empathetic, and a father may be domineering or weak
rather than protective and strong.
Children must adapt to this. In any event, the boy and the girl will
internalize the positive and the negative qualities of the parent of the
opposite sex in ways that are unconscious and profound. And the
association with the parent of the opposite sex will be charged with all
kinds of emotions—physical and sensual connections, tremendous
feelings of excitement, fascination, or disappointment at what one was
not given.
Soon, however, comes a critical period in our early lives in which we
must separate from our parents and forge our identity. And the
simplest and most powerful way to create this identity is around
gender roles, the masculine and the feminine. The boy will tend to
have an ambivalent relationship to his mother that will mark him for
life. On the one hand he craves the security and adoring attention she
gives him; on the other hand he feels threatened by her, as if she might
suffocate him in her femininity and he would lose himself. He fears her
authority and her power over his life. From a certain age forward, he
feels the need to differentiate himself. He needs to establish his own
sense of masculine identity. Certainly the physical changes that occur
as he gets older will fuel this identity with the masculine, but in the
process he will tend to overidentify with the role (unless he identifies
with the feminine role instead), playing up his toughness and
independence to emphasize his separation from the mother. The other
sides to his character—the empathy, the gentleness, the need for
connection, which he absorbed from the mother or were naturally a
part of him—will tend to become repressed and sink into the
unconscious.
The girl may have an adventurous spirit and may incorporate the
willpower and determination of her father into her own personality.
But as she gets older, she will most likely feel pressure to conform to
certain cultural norms and to forge her identity around what is
considered feminine. Girls are supposed to be nice, sweet, and
deferential. They are supposed to put the interests of others before
their own. They are supposed to tame any wild streaks, to look pretty

[PAGE 371]
and to be objects of desire. For the individual girl, these expectations
turn into voices she hears in her head, continually judging her and
making her doubt her self-worth. These pressures may be subtler in
our day and age, but they still exert a powerful influence. The more
exploratory, aggressive, and darker sides of her character—both
naturally occurring and absorbed from the father—will tend to become
repressed and sink into the unconscious, if she adopts a more
traditionally feminine role.
The unconscious feminine part of the boy and the man is what Jung
calls the anima. The unconscious masculine part of the girl and
woman are the animus. Because they are parts of ourselves that are
deeply buried, we are never really aware of them in our daily life. But
once we become fascinated with a person of the opposite sex, the
anima and animus stir to life. The attraction we feel toward another
might be purely physical, but more often the person who draws our
attention unconsciously bears some resemblance—physical or
psychological—to our mother or father. Remember that this primal
relationship is full of charged energy, excitement, and obsessions that
are repressed but yearning to come out. A person who triggers these
associations in us will be a magnet for our attention, even though we
are not aware of the source of our attraction.
If the relationship to the mother or father was mostly positive, we
will tend to project onto the other person the desirable qualities that
our parent had, in the hope of reexperiencing that early paradise. Take,
for instance, a young man whose mother nurtured and adored him. He
may have been a sweet, loving little boy, devoted to his mother and
reflecting her nurturing energy, but he repressed these traits in himself
as he grew into an independent man with a masculine image to uphold.
In the woman who triggers an association with his mother he will see
the capacity to adore him that he secretly craves. This feeling of getting
what he wants will intensify his excitement and physical attraction.
She will supply him the qualities he never developed in himself. He is
falling in love with his own anima, in the form of the desired woman.
If the feelings toward the mother or father were mostly ambivalent
(their attention inconsistent), we will often try to fix the original
relationship by falling in love with someone who reminds us of our
imperfect parent figure, in the hope that we can subtract their negative
qualities and get what we never quite got in our earliest years. If the
relationship was mostly negative, we may go in search of someone with

[PAGE 372]
the opposite qualities to that parent, often of a dark, shadowy nature.
For instance, a girl who had a father who was too strict, distant, and
critical perhaps had the secret desire to rebel but didn’t dare to. As a
young woman she might be drawn to a rebellious, unconventional
young man who represents the wild side she was never able to express,
and is the polar opposite of her father. The rebel is her animus, now
externalized in the form of the young man.
In any case, whether the association is positive, negative, or
ambivalent, powerful emotions are triggered, and feeling ourselves
transported to the primal relationship in our childhood, we act in ways
that are often contrary to the persona we present. We become
hysterical, needy, obsessive, controlling. The anima and animus have
their own personalities, and so when they come to life we act like
person B. Because we are not really relating to women and men as they
are, but rather to our projections, we will eventually feel disappointed
in them, as if they are to blame for not being what we had imagined.
The relationship will often tend to fall apart from the misreading and
miscommunications on both sides, and not aware of the source of this,
we will go through precisely the same cycle with the next person.
There are infinite variations on these patterns, because everyone
has very particular circumstances and mixes of the masculine and
feminine. For instance, there are men who are more psychologically
feminine than women and women who are more psychologically
masculine than men. If they are heterosexual, the man will be drawn to
masculine women who have the qualities he never developed in
himself. He has more of an animus than an anima. The woman will be
drawn to feminine men. There are many such contrasexual couples,
some more overt than others, and they can be successful if both sides
get what they want—a famous historical example would be the
composer Frédéric Chopin and the writer George Sand, Sand being
more like the husband and Chopin like the wife. If they are
homosexual, the man or woman will still be in search of the
contrasexual qualities undeveloped from within. In general, people are
imbalanced, overidentifying with the masculine or feminine and drawn
to the polar opposite.
Your task as a student of human nature is threefold: First you must
try to observe the anima and the animus as they manifest themselves
in others, particularly in their intimate relationships. By paying
attention to their behavior and patterns in these situations, you will

[PAGE 373]
have access to their unconscious that is normally denied to you. You
will see the parts of themselves they have repressed, and you can use
such knowledge to great effect. Pay special attention to those who are
hypermasculine or hyperfeminine. You can be sure that below the
surface lurks a very feminine anima for the man and a very masculine
animus for the woman. When people go extra far in repressing their
feminine or masculine qualities, these will tend to leak out in a
caricatured form.
The hypermasculine man, for instance, will be secretly obsessed
with clothes and his looks. He will display an unusual interest in
people’s appearances, including other men, and make rather snippy
judgments about them. Richard Nixon desperately tried to project a
macho image to those who worked for him as president, but he was
constantly commenting on and fussing over the color of the suits they
wore and the drapes in his office. The hypermasculine man will
express strong opinions about cars, technology, or politics that are not
based on real knowledge, and when called on this, he will become
rather hysterical in his defense, throw a tantrum, or pout. He is always
trying to contain his emotions, but they can often have a life of their
own. For instance, without wanting to, he will suddenly become quite
sentimental.
The hyperfeminine woman will often be concealing a great deal of
repressed anger and resentment at the role she has been forced to play.
Her seductive, girlish behavior with men is actually a ploy for power, to
tease, entrap, and hurt the target. Her masculine side will leak out in
passive-aggressive behavior, attempts to dominate people in
relationships in underhanded ways. Underneath the sweet, deferential
façade, she can be quite willful and highly judgmental of others. Her
willfulness, always under the surface, will come out in rather irrational
stubbornness in petty matters.
Your second task is to become aware of the projecting mechanism
within yourself. (See the next section for common types of
projections.) Projections have a positive role to play in your life, and
you could not stop them even if you wanted to, because they are so
automatic and unconscious. Without them, you would not find yourself
paying deep attention to a person, becoming fascinated with him or
her, idealizing, and falling in love. But once the relationship develops,
you need to have the power and awareness to withdraw the
projections, so that you can begin to see women and men as they really

[PAGE 374]
are. In doing so, perhaps you will realize how truly incompatible you
are, or the opposite. Once connected to the real person, you can
continue to idealize him or her, but this will be based on actual positive
qualities he or she possesses. Perhaps you can find his or her faults
charming. You can accomplish all of this by becoming aware of your
own patterns and the types of qualities you tend to project onto others.
This also has relevance to relationships with the opposite sex that
are not intimate. Imagine that in an office situation a colleague
criticizes your work or postpones a meeting you asked for. If that
person happens to be of the opposite sex, all kinds of emotions—
resentments, fears, disappointments, hostility—will be stirred up,
along with various projections, whereas with someone of your own
gender there would be much less of a reaction. Seeing this dynamic in
everyday life, you will be better able to control it and have smoother
relationships with those of the opposite sex.
Your third task is to look inward, to see those feminine or masculine
qualities that are repressed and undeveloped within you. You will catch
glimpses of your anima or animus in your relationships with the
opposite sex. That assertiveness you desire to see in a man, or empathy
in a woman, is something you need to develop within yourself,
bringing out that feminine or masculine undertone. What you are
doing in essence is integrating into your everyday personality the traits
that are within you but are repressed. They will no longer operate
independently and automatically, in the form of possession. They will
become part of your everyday self, and people will be drawn to the
authenticity they sense in you. (For more on this, see the final section
of this chapter.)
—
Finally, when it comes to gender roles, we like to imagine a continual
line of progress leading to perfect equality, and to believe that we are
not far from reaching this ideal. But this is hardly the truth. Although
on one level we can see definite progress, on another level, one that is
deeper, we can see increasing tension and polarization between the
sexes, as if the old patterns of inequality between men and women
exert an unconscious influence upon us.

[PAGE 375]
This tension can sometimes feel like a war, and it stems from a
growing psychological distance between the genders, in which people
of the opposite sex seem like alien creatures, with habits and patterns
of behavior we cannot begin to fathom. This distance can turn into
hostility among some. Although we can see this in both men and
women, the hostility is stronger among men. Perhaps this is related to
the latent hostility many men feel toward the mother figure, and the
feeling of dependency and weakness she unconsciously triggers. The
male sense of masculinity often has a defensive edge that reveals
underlying insecurities. Such insecurity has only become more acute
with shifting gender roles, and it increases the suspiciousness and
hostility between men and women.
This outer conflict between the genders, however, is merely a
reflection of an unresolved inner conflict. As long as the inner feminine
or masculine is denied, the outer distance will only grow. When we
bridge this distance from within, our attitude toward the opposite sex
changes as well. We feel a deeper connection. We can talk and relate to
them as if relating to parts of ourselves. The polarity between the sexes
still exists and still causes us to be attracted and fall in love, but now it
includes the desire to get closer to the feminine or the masculine. This
is much different from the polarization between the genders, in which
distance and hostility eventually come to the fore in the relationship
and push people further away. The inner connection will vastly
improve the outer connection and should be the ideal we aim for.
Gender Projection—Types
Although there are infinite variations, below you will find six of the
more common types of gender projections. You must use this
knowledge in three ways: First, you must recognize in yourself any
tendency toward one of these forms of projection. This will help you
understand something profound about your earliest years and make it
much easier for you to withdraw your projections on other people.
Second, you must use this as an invaluable tool for gaining access to
the unconscious of other people, to seeing their anima and animus in
action.
And finally, you must be attentive to how others will project onto
you their needs and fantasies. Keep in mind that when you are the
target of other people’s projections, the temptation is to want to live up

[PAGE 376]
to their idealization of you, to be their fantasy. You get caught up in
their excitement and you want to believe you are as great, strong, or
empathetic as they imagine. Without realizing it, you begin to play the
role they want you to play. You become the mother or father figure
they crave. Inevitably, however, you will come to resent this—you
cannot be yourself; you are not appreciated for your true qualities.
Better to be aware of this dynamic before it entraps you.
The Devilish Romantic: For the woman in this scenario, the man who
fascinates her—often older and successful—might seem like a rake, the
type who cannot help but chase after young women. But he is also
romantic. When he’s in love, he showers the woman with attention.
She decides she will seduce him and become the target of his attention.
She will play to his fantasies. How can he not want to settle down with
her and reform himself? She will bask in his love. But somehow he is
not as strong, masculine, or romantic as she had imagined. He is a bit
self-absorbed. She does not get the desired attention, or it does not last
very long. He cannot be reformed, and leaves her.
This is often the projection of women who had rather intense, even
flirtatious relationships with the father. Such fathers often find their
wives boring, and the young daughter more charming and playful.
They turn to the daughter for inspiration; the daughter becomes
addicted to their attention and adept at playing the kind of girl that
daddy wants. It gives her a sense of power. It becomes her lifelong goal
to recapture this attention and the power that goes with it. Any
association with the father figure will spark the projecting mechanism,
and she will invent or exaggerate the man’s romantic nature.
A prime example of this type would be Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.
Jack Bouvier, her father, adored his two daughters, but Jacqueline was
his favorite. Jack was devilishly handsome and dashing. He was a
narcissist obsessed with his body and the fine clothes that he wore. He
considered himself macho, a real risk taker, but underneath the façade
he was in fact quite feminine in his tastes and totally immature. He
was also a notorious womanizer. He treated Jackie more like a
playmate and lover than a daughter. For Jackie, he could do no wrong.
She took perverse pride in his popularity with women. In the frequent
fights between her mother and father, she always took his side.
Compared to the fun-loving father, the mother was prudish and rigid.

[PAGE 377]
Spending so much time in his company, even after her parents
divorced, and thinking of him constantly, Jackie deeply absorbed his
energy and spirit. As a young woman, she turned all of her attention to
older, powerful, and unconventional men, with whom she could re-
create the role she had played with her father—always the little girl in
need of his love, but also quite flirtatious. And she was continually
disappointed in the men she had chosen. John F. Kennedy was the
closest to her ideal, for in so many ways he was just like her father in
looks and in spirit. Kennedy, however, would never give her the
attention she craved. He was too self-absorbed. He was too busy
having affairs with other women. He was not really the romantic type.
She was continually frustrated in this relationship, but she was trapped
in this pattern, later marrying Aristotle Onassis, an older,
unconventional man of great power who seemed so dashing and
romantic but who would treat her horribly and cheat on her
continually.
Women in this scenario have become trapped by the early attention
paid to them by the father. They have to be continually charming,
inspiring, and flirtatious to elicit that attention later on. Their animus
is seductive, but with an aggressive, masculine edge, having absorbed
so much of the father’s energy. But they are in a continual search for a
man who does not exist. If the man were completely attentive and
tirelessly romantic, they would grow bored with him. He would be seen
as too weak. They are secretly drawn to the devilish side of their
fantasy man and to the narcissism that comes with it. Women trapped
in this projection will grow resentful over the years about how much
energy they have to expend playing to men’s fantasies and how little
they get in return. The only way out of the trap for such women is to
see the pattern itself, to stop mythologizing the father, and to focus
instead on the damage he has caused by the inappropriate attention he
paid to them.
The Elusive Woman of Perfection: He thinks he has found the ideal
woman. She will give him what he’s been missing in his prior
relationships, whether that’s some wildness, some comfort and
compassion, or a creative spark. Although he has had few actual
encounters with the woman in question, he can imagine all kinds of
positive experiences with her. The more he thinks of her, the more he’s
certain he cannot live without her. When he talks of this perfect
woman, you will notice there’s not a lot of concrete detail about what

[PAGE 378]
makes her so perfect. If he does manage to forge a relationship, he will
quickly become disenchanted. She’s not who he thought she was; she
misled him. He then moves on to the next woman to project his fantasy
onto.
This is a common form of male projection. It contains all of the
elements he thinks he never got from his mother, never got from the
other women in his life. This ideal mate will haunt his dreams. She will
not appear to him in the form of someone he knows; she is a woman
fashioned in his imagination—often young, elusive, but promising
something great. In real life, certain types of women will tend to trigger
this projection. She is usually quite hard to pin down and conforms to
what Freud called the narcissistic woman—self-contained, not really
needing a man or anybody to complete her. She can be a bit cold at the
core and a blank screen upon which men can project whatever they
want. Alternatively, she can seem to be a free spirit, full of creative
energy but without a clear sense of her own identity. For men she
serves as a muse, a great spark to their imagination, a lure to loosen up
their own rigid mind.
The men prone to this projection often had mothers who were not
totally there for them. Perhaps such a mother expected the son to give
her the attention and validation she was not getting from her husband.
Because of this reversal, when the boy becomes a man, he feels a great
emptiness inside that he constantly needs to fill. He cannot exactly
verbalize what he wants or what he missed, hence the vagueness of his
fantasy. He will spend his life searching for this elusive figure and
never settle on a flesh-and-blood female. It’s always the next one who
will be perfect. If he falls for the narcissistic type, he will repeat the
problem he experienced with his mother, falling for a woman who
cannot give him what he wants. His own anima is a bit dreamy,
introspective, and moody, which is the behavior he will tend to exhibit
when in love.
Men of this type must recognize the nature of their pattern. What
they really need is to find and interact with a real woman, accept her
inevitable flaws, and give more of themselves. They often prefer to
chase their fantasy, because in such a scenario they are in control and
have the freedom to leave when reality sets in. To break the pattern,
such men will have to give up some of this control. When it comes to
their need for a muse, they must learn to find such inspiration from
within, to bring out more of the anima within themselves. They are too

[PAGE 379]
alienated from their own feminine spirit and need to loosen up their
own thought processes. Not needing this wildness from their fantasy
woman, they will better relate to the actual women in their life.
The Lovable Rebel: For the woman who is drawn to this type, the man
who intrigues her has a noticeable disdain for authority. He is a
nonconformist. Unlike the Devilish Romantic, this man will often be
young and not so successful. He will also tend to be outside her usual
circle of acquaintances. To have a relationship with him would be ever
so slightly taboo—certainly her father would not approve, and perhaps
not her friends or colleagues. If a relationship does ensue, however,
she will see a totally different side to him. He can’t hold down a good
job, not because he’s a rebel but because he’s lazy and ineffectual.
Despite the tattoos and shaved head, he’s quite conventional,
controlling, and domineering. The relationship will break apart, but
the fantasy will remain.
The woman with this projection often had a strong, patriarchal
father who was distant and strict. The father represents order, rules,
and conventions. He was often quite critical of his daughter—she was
never good or pretty or smart enough. She internalized this critical
voice and hears it in her head all the time. As a girl she dreamed of
rebelling and asserting herself against the father’s control, but too
often she was reduced to obeying and playing the deferential daughter.
Her desire to rebel was repressed and went into her animus, which is
quite angry and resentful. Instead of developing the rebelliousness
herself, she looks to externalize it in the form of the rebellious male. If
she senses a man might be like this, based on his appearance, she will
project fantasies that are charged and sexual. Oftentimes she chooses a
man who is relatively young because this makes him less threatening,
less of a patriarch. But his youth and immaturity make it almost
impossible to form a stable relationship, and her angry side will come
out as she grows disenchanted.
Once a woman recognizes she is prone to this projection, she must
come to terms with a simple fact: what she really wants is to develop
the independence, assertiveness, and power to disobey in herself. It is
never too late to do so, but these qualities must be built up and
developed in small steps, everyday challenges in which she practices
saying no, breaking some rules, et cetera. Becoming more assertive,
she can begin to have relationships that are more equal and satisfying.

[PAGE 380]
The Fallen Woman: To the man in question, the woman who
fascinates him seems so different from those he has known. Perhaps
she comes from a different culture or social class. Perhaps she is not as
educated as he is. There might be something dubious about her
character and her past; she is certainly less physically restrained than
most women. He thinks she’s earthy. She seems to be in need of
protection, education, and money. He will be the one to rescue and
elevate her. But somehow the closer he gets to her, the less it turns out
as he had expected.
In Swann’s Way, volume 1 of the novel In Search of Lost Time by
Marcel Proust, the protagonist, Charles Swann—based on a real person
—is an aesthete, a connoisseur of art. He is also a Don Juan who is
deathly afraid of any relationship or form of commitment. He has
seduced many women of his class. But then he meets a woman named
Odette, who is from a decidedly different social circle. She is
uneducated, a bit vulgar, and some would say she is a courtesan. She
intrigues him. Then one day, while staring at a reproduction of a
biblical scene from a Botticelli fresco, he decides she resembles a
woman in the painting. Now he is fascinated and begins to idealize her.
Odette must have had a hard life, and she deserves better. Despite his
fear of commitment, he will marry her and educate her in the finer
things of life. What he doesn’t realize is that she does not at all
resemble the woman he fantasizes about. She is extremely clever and
strong willed, much stronger than he is. She will end up making him
her passive slave, as she continues to have affairs with other men and
women.
Men of this type often had strong mother figures in their childhood.
They became good, obedient boys, excellent students at school.
Consciously they are attracted to well-educated women, to those who
seem good and perfect. But unconsciously they are drawn to women
who are imperfect, bad, of dubious character. They secretly crave what
is the opposite of themselves. It is the classic split of the mother/whore
—they want the mother figure for a wife but feel a much stronger
physical attraction to the whore, the Fallen Woman, the type who likes
to display her body. They have repressed the playful, sensual, and
earthy sides of the character they had as boys. They are too rigid and
civilized. The only way they can relate to these qualities is through
women who appear to be so different from themselves. Like Swann,
they find a way to idealize them with some highbrow reference that has

[PAGE 381]
no relation to reality. They project onto such women weakness and
vulnerability. They tell themselves they want to help and protect them.
But what really attracts them is the danger and naughty pleasures
these women seem to promise. Underestimating the strength of such
women, they often end up as their pawns. Their anima is passive and
masochistic.
Men who engage in this kind of projection need to develop the less
conventional sides of their character. They need to move outside their
comfort zone and try new experiences on their own. They require more
challenges, and even a bit of danger that will help loosen them up.
Perhaps they need to take more risks at work. They also need to
develop the more physical and sensual side of their character. Not
having to get what they crave by looking for the Fallen Woman type,
they can actually begin to satisfy their urges with any type of woman,
not passively waiting for her to lead them astray but actively initiating
the guilty pleasures.
The Superior Man: He seems brilliant, skilled, strong, and stable. He
radiates confidence and power. He could be a high-powered
businessman, a professor, an artist, a guru. Even though he may be
older and not so physically attractive, his self-assurance gives him an
attractive aura. For the woman attracted to this type, a relationship
with him would give her an indirect feeling of strength and superiority.
In the novel Middlemarch (1872) by George Eliot, the main
character, Dorothea Brooke, is a nineteen-year-old orphan raised by
her wealthy uncle. Dorothea is quite beautiful and would be a desirable
match for marriage. In fact, a local young man named Sir James
Chettam is actively courting her. But one evening she meets the much
older Edward Causabon, a wealthy landowner who has devoted his life
to scholarly pursuits, and he intrigues her. She starts to pay him
attention and he courts her, much to the horror of her sister and uncle.
To them he is ugly, with moles on his face and a sallow complexion. He
slurps his food and talks very little. But to Dorothea his face is full of a
spiritual quality. He is too above people to care about etiquette. He
talks little because no one would understand him. Being married to
him would be like being married to Pascal or Kant. She’ll learn Greek
and Latin and help him complete his great masterpiece, The Key to All
Mythologies. And he will help educate and elevate her. He will be the
father she has been unconsciously missing. Only after being married to
him does she discover the truth—he’s dead inside, and very controlling.

[PAGE 382]
He sees her as a glorified secretary. She becomes trapped in a loveless
marriage.
Although the relationship details might be quite different now, this
type of projection is all too common among women. It stems from
feelings of inferiority. The woman in this case has internalized the
voices of the father and others who have been so critical of her, who
have lowered her self-esteem by telling her who she is and how she
should behave. Not having ever developed her own strength or
confidence, she will tend to search for these qualities in men and
exaggerate any traces of them. Many of the men who respond to her
sense her low self-esteem and find this alluring. They like the adoring
attention of a woman, often younger, whom they can lord over and
control. This would be the classic professor seducing the student.
Because such men are rarely as brilliant, clever, and self-assured as she
imagines, the woman either is disappointed and leaves or is trapped in
her low self-esteem, bending to his manipulations and blaming herself
for any problems.
What such a woman needs to do is first realize that the source of her
insecurity is the critical opinions of others, which she has accepted and
internalized. It does not stem from her inherent lack of intelligence or
worthiness. She must actively work at developing her assertiveness and
self-confidence through her actions—taking on projects, starting a
business, mastering a craft. With men, she must see herself as their
natural equal, as potentially strong and creative as they are, or even
more so. With genuine self-confidence she will then be able to gauge
the true worth and character of the men she meets.
The Woman to Worship Him: He’s driven and ambitious, but his life is
hard. It’s a harsh, unforgiving world out there, and it’s not easy to find
any comfort. He feels something missing in his life. Then along comes
a woman who is attentive to him, warm, and engaging. She seems to
admire him. He feels overwhelmingly drawn to her and her energy.
This is the woman to complete him, to help comfort him. But then, as
the relationship develops, she no longer seems quite so nice and
attentive. She certainly has stopped admiring him. He concludes that
she has deceived him or has changed. Such a betrayal makes him
angry.
This male projection generally stems from a particular type of
relationship with the mother—she adores her son and showers him

[PAGE 383]
with attention. Perhaps this is to compensate for never quite getting
what she wants from her husband. She fills the boy with confidence; he
becomes addicted to her attention and craves her warm, enveloping
presence, which is what she wants.
When he grows up, he is often quite ambitious, always trying to live
up to the expectations of his mother. He pushes himself hard. He
chooses a certain type of woman to pursue and then subtly positions
her to play the mother role—to comfort, adore, and pump up his ego.
In many instances, the woman will come to understand how he has
manipulated her into this role, and she will resent it. She will stop
being so soothing and reverential. He will blame her for changing, but
in fact he is the one projecting qualities that were never exactly there
and trying to make her conform to his expectations. The ensuing
breakup will be very painful for the man, because he has invested
energy from his earliest years and will feel this as abandonment from
the mother figure. Even if he is successful in getting the woman to play
the role, he himself will feel resentment at his dependency on her, the
same dependency and ambivalence he had toward his mother. He may
sabotage the relationship or withdraw. His anima has a sharp,
recriminating edge, always ready to complain and blame.
The man in this case must see the pattern of these relationships in
his life. What this should signal to him is that he needs to develop from
within more of the mothering qualities that he projects onto women.
He must see the nature of his ambition as stemming from his desire to
please his mother and live up to her expectations. He tends to drive
himself too hard. He must learn to comfort and soothe himself, to
withdraw from time to time and be satisfied with his accomplishments.
He needs to be able to care for himself. This will drastically improve
his relationships. He will give more, instead of waiting to be adored
and taken care of. He will relate to women as they are, and in the end
they will perhaps feel unconsciously impelled to provide more of the
comfort he needs, without being pushed into this.
The Original Man/Woman
A common experience for us humans is that at a certain point in life—
often near the age of forty—we go through what is known as a midlife
crisis. Our work has become mechanical and soulless. Our intimate
relationships have lost their excitement and spirit. We crave change,

[PAGE 384]
and we look for it through a new career or relationship, some new
experiences, even some danger. Such changes may give us a short-term
therapeutic jolt, but they leave the real source of the problem
untouched, and the malaise will return.
Let us look at this phenomenon from a different angle—as a crisis of
identity. As children, we had a rather fluid sense of self. We absorbed
the energy of everyone and everything around us. We felt a very wide
range of emotions and were open to experience. But in our youth we
had to shape a social self, one that was cohesive and would allow us to
fit into a group. To do so we had to trim and tighten up our freer-
flowing spirit. And much of this tightening revolved around gender
roles. We had to repress masculine or feminine aspects of ourselves, in
order to feel and present a more consistent self.
In our late teens and into our twenties, we continually adjust this
identity in order to fit in—it is still a work in progress, and we derive
some pleasure in forging this identity. We feel our lives can go in many
directions, and the many possibilities enchant us. But as the years go
by, the gender role we play gets more and more fixed, and we begin to
sense that we have lost something essential, that we are almost
strangers to who we were in our youth. Our creative energies have
dried up. Naturally we look outward for the source of this crisis, but it
comes from within. We have become imbalanced, too rigidly identified
with our role and the mask we present to others. Our original nature
incorporated more of the qualities that we absorbed from the mother
or father, and of the traits of the opposite sex that are biologically a
part of us. At a certain point, we inwardly rebel at the loss of what is so
essentially a part of us.
In primitive cultures around the world, the wisest man or woman in
the tribe was the shaman, the healer who could communicate with the
spirit world. The male shaman had an inner woman or wife whom he
listened to closely and who guided him. The female shaman had the
inner husband. The shamans’ power came from the depth of their
communication with this inner figure, which was experienced as a real
woman or man from within. The shaman figure reflects a profound
psychological truth that our most primitive ancestors had access to. In
fact, in the myths of many ancient cultures—Persian, Hebrew, Greek,
Egyptian—original humans were believed to be both male and female;
this made them so powerful that the gods feared them and split them
in half.

[PAGE 385]
Understand: The return to your original nature contains
elemental power. By relating more to the natural feminine or
masculine parts within you, you will unleash energy that has been
repressed; your mind will recover its natural fluidity; you will
understand and relate better to those of the opposite sex; and by
ridding yourself of the defensiveness you have in relation to your
gender role, you will feel secure in who you are. This return requires
that you play with styles of thinking and acting that are more
masculine or feminine, depending on your imbalance. But before
describing such a process, we must first come to terms with a deeply
ingrained human prejudice about the masculine and the feminine.
For millennia, it has been men who largely defined masculine and
feminine roles and who imposed value judgments on them. Feminine
styles of thinking were associated with irrationality, and feminine ways
of acting seen as weak and inferior. We may have outwardly
progressed in terms of inequality between the genders, but inwardly
these judgments still have profound roots in us. The masculine style of
thinking is still esteemed as superior, and femininity is still
experienced as soft and weak. Many women have internalized these
judgments. They feel that being equal means being able to be as tough
and aggressive as men. But what is truly needed in the modern world is
to see the masculine and the feminine as completely equal in potential
reasoning power and strength of action, but in different ways.
Let us say there are feminine and masculine styles when it comes to
thinking, taking action, learning from experience, and relating to other
people. These styles have been reflected in the behavior of men and
women for thousands of years. Some are related to physiological
differences, some stem mostly from culture. Certainly there are men
who have more feminine styles and women more masculine styles, but
almost all of us are imbalanced to one side or the other. Our task is to
open ourselves up to the opposite. We have only our rigidity to lose.
Masculine and feminine styles of thinking: Masculine thinking tends
toward focusing on what separates phenomena from one another and
categorizing them. It looks for contrasts between things to better label
them. It wants to take things apart, like a machine, and analyze the
separate parts that go into the whole. Its thought process is linear,
figuring out the sequence of steps that goes into an event. It prefers to
look at things from the outside, with emotional detachment. The
masculine way of thinking tends to prefer specialization, to dig deep

[PAGE 386]
into something specific. It feels pleasure in uncovering the order in
phenomena. It likes to build elaborate structures, whether in a book or
a business.
Feminine thinking orients itself differently. It likes to focus on the
whole, how the parts connect to one another, the overall gestalt. In
looking at a group of people, it wants to see how they relate to one
another. Instead of freezing phenomena in time in order to examine
them, it focuses on the organic process itself, how one thing grows into
another. In trying to solve a puzzle, the feminine style will prefer to
meditate on several aspects, absorb the patterns, and let answers or
solutions come to the individual over time, as if they needed to be
cooked. This form of thinking leads to insights when the hidden
connections between things suddenly become visible in intuitive
flashes. As opposed to specialization, it is more interested in how
different fields or forms of knowledge can connect to one another. In
studying another culture, for instance, it will want to get closer to it, to
understand how it is experienced from within. It is more sensitive to
information from the senses, not merely from abstract reasoning.
For too long the masculine style has been seen as more rational and
scientific, but this does not reflect the reality. All of the greatest
scientists in history have displayed a powerful mix of the masculine
and feminine styles. The biologist Louis Pasteur’s greatest discoveries
came from his ability to open his mind to as many explanations as
possible, to let them cook in his mind, in order to see the connections
between wide-ranging phenomena. Einstein attributed all of his
greatest discoveries to intuitions, in which long hours of thinking gave
way to sudden insights about the interconnection of certain facts. The
anthropologist Margaret Mead used the latest abstract models from
her time to rigorously analyze indigenous cultures, but she combined
this with months of living within it and gaining a feel from the inside
position.
In business, Warren Buffett is an example of someone who blends
the two styles. When he considers buying a company, he breaks it
down into its component parts and analyzes them in statistical depth,
but he also tries to get a feel for the overall gestalt of the business, how
the employees relate to one another, the spirit of the group as instilled
by the man or woman at the top—a lot of the intangibles most
businesspeople ignore. He looks at a company from both the outside
and the inside.

[PAGE 387]
Almost all people will lean more toward one style of thinking. What
you want for yourself is to create balance by leaning more in the other
direction. If you are more on the masculine side, you want to widen the
fields you look at, finding connections between different forms of
knowledge. In looking for solutions, you want to consider more
possibilities, give greater time to the deliberative process, and allow for
freer associations. You need to take seriously the intuitions that come
to you after much deliberation, and not discount the value of emotions
in thinking. Without a sense of excitement and inspiration, your
thinking can become stale and lifeless.
If you lean more in the feminine direction, you need to be capable of
focusing and digging into specific problems, tamping down the
impulse to widen your search and multitask. You have to find pleasure
in boring into one aspect of a problem. Reconstructing a causal chain
and continually refining it will give depth to your thinking. You tend to
see structure and order as dull affairs, giving greater emphasis to
expressing an idea and feeling inspired by it. Instead, you need to
derive pleasure in paying deep attention to the structure of a book,
argument, or project. Being creative and clear with the structure will
give your material its power to influence people. Sometimes you need
to gain greater emotional distance to understand a problem, and you
must force yourself to do so.
Masculine and feminine styles of action: When it comes to taking action,
the masculine tendency is to move forward, explore the situation,
attack, and vanquish. If there are obstacles in the way, it will try to
push through them, this desire aptly expressed by the ancient military
leader Hannibal—“I will either find a way or make a way.” It derives
pleasure from staying on the offensive and taking risks. It prefers to
maintain its independence and room to maneuver.
When confronted with a problem or the need to take action, the
feminine style often prefers to first withdraw from the immediate
situation and contemplate more deeply the options. It will often look
for ways to avoid the conflict, to smooth out relations, to win without
having to go to battle. Sometimes the best action is nonaction—let the
dynamic play itself out to understand it better; let the enemy hang
itself by its aggressive actions.
This was the style of Queen Elizabeth I, whose primary strategy was
to wait and see: when confronted with an imminent invasion by

[PAGE 388]
Spain’s vast seafaring armada, she decided to not commit to a strategy
until she knew exactly when the armada was launched and the weather
conditions of the moment, working to slow down its advance and let
the bad weather destroy it, with minimal loss of life. Instead of
charging forward, the feminine style lays traps for the enemy.
Independence is not an essential value in action; in fact, it is better to
focus on interdependent relationships and how one move might harm
an ally and cause ripple effects to an alliance.
In the West, this feminine style of strategizing and acting is
instinctively judged as weak and timid. But in other cultures the style is
viewed quite differently. To Chinese strategists, wu-wei, or nonaction,
is often the height of wisdom and aggressive action a sign of stupidity
because it narrows one’s options. There is in fact tremendous strength
contained within the feminine style—patience, resilience, and
flexibility. To the great samurai warrior Miyamoto Musashi, the ability
to stand back and wait, to let the opponent tire himself out mentally
before counterattacking, was critical for success.
For those with the aggressive, masculine inclination, balance would
come from training yourself to step back before taking any action.
Consider the possibility that it is better to wait and see how things play
out, or even to not respond at all. Taking action without proper
consideration reveals weakness and a lack of self-control. For balance,
always try to consider the interdependent relationships you are
involved in and how each group or individual will be affected by any
action. If you find yourself blocked in your career later in life, you must
learn the power of withdrawing and reflecting on who you are, your
needs, your strengths and weaknesses, your true interests before
making any important decisions. This could require weeks or months
of introspection. Some of the greatest leaders in history honed their
best ideas while in prison. As the French would say, reculer pour
mieux sauter (“step back in order to leap forward”).
For those with the feminine style, it is best to accustom yourself to
various degrees of conflict and confrontation, so that any avoidance of
it is strategic and not out of fear. This requires baby steps, confronting
people in small ways in everyday situations before handling larger
conflicts. Drop the need to always consider the other side’s feelings;
sometimes there are bad people who need to be thwarted, and being
empathetic only empowers them. You need to be comfortable saying
no and turning people down. Sometimes when you try to smooth

[PAGE 389]
things out, it is not out of empathy or strategy but out of an aversion to
displeasing people. You have been trained to be deferential, and you
need to get rid of this impulse. You need to reconnect to the bold and
adventurous spirit you once had and widen your strategic options to
both offense and defense. Sometimes you can overthink things and
come up with too many options. Action for its own sake can be
therapeutic, and taking aggressive action can discomfit your
opponents.
Masculine and feminine styles of self-assessment and learning: As studies
have shown, when men make mistakes they tend to look outward and
find other people or circumstances to blame. Men’s sense of self is
deeply tied to their success, and they do not like to look inward if they
fail. This makes it difficult to learn from failures. On the other hand,
men will tend to feel that they are completely responsible for any
success in life. This will make them blind to the element of luck and the
help of others, which will feed their grandiose tendencies (see
