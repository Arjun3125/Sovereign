this). They do not know their calling; they could do many things, they
think, and often try different jobs. They wander around and feel empty
inside. They naturally envy those who act with a sense of purpose, and
will go so far as to attach themselves to such a person’s life, partly
wishing to get some of what they themselves are missing and partly
desiring to harm the other person.

[PAGE 312]
In general, be wary of those who are too eager to attach themselves
to your life, too impatient to make themselves useful. They try to draw
you into a relationship not by their experience and competence but by
the flattery and attention they give you. Their form of attack is to
gather information on you that they can leak out or spread as gossip,
harming your reputation. Learn to hire and work with those who have
experience rather than just a pleasing manner.
The Insecure Master: For some people, reaching a high position
validates their self-opinion and boosts their self-esteem. But there are
some who are more anxious. Holding a high position tends to increase
their insecurities, which they are careful to conceal. Secretly they doubt
whether they are worthy of the responsibility. They look at others who
might have more talent, even those below them, with an envious eye.
You will work for such bosses under the assumption that they are
self-assured and confident. How else could they have become the boss?
You will work extra hard to impress them, show them you’re a person
on the way up, only to find yourself after several months suddenly
demoted or fired, which makes little sense, since you had clearly
delivered results. You did not realize you were dealing with the
insecure variety and had inadvertently triggered their self-doubts.
They secretly envy your youth, your energy, your promise, and the
signs of your talent. Even worse if you are socially gifted and they are
not. They will justify the firing or demotion with some narrative they
have concocted; you will never discover the truth.
Michael Eisner, all-powerful CEO of Disney for twenty years, is just
such a type. In 1995 he fired his number two man, Jeffrey Katzenberg,
head of the film studio, ostensibly because of his abrasive personality,
saying he was not a team player. In truth, Katzenberg had had far too
much success in his position; the films he oversaw became the main
source of Disney’s revenue. He had the golden touch. Never admitting
this to himself, Eisner clearly envied Katzenberg for his talent and
transmuted this into hostility. This pattern repeated itself time and
again with new creative people he brought in.
Pay attention to those above you for signs of insecurity and envy.
They will inevitably have a track record of firing people for strange
reasons. They will not seem particularly happy with that excellent
report you turned in. Always play it safe by deferring to bosses, making
them look better, and earning their trust. Couch your brilliant ideas as

[PAGE 313]
their ideas. Let them get all the credit for your hard work. Your time to
shine will come, but not if you inadvertently stimulate their
insecurities.
Envy Triggers
Although certain types are more prone to envy, you must also be aware
that there are circumstances that will tend to trigger envy in almost
anyone. You must be extra alert in such situations.
The most common trigger is a sudden change in your status, which
alters your relationship to friends and peers. This is particularly true
among people in your own profession. This has been known for a long
time. As Hesiod noted in the eighth century BC, “The potter envies the
potter, the craftsman the craftsman, the writer the writer.” If you
experience success, those in your field who have similar aspirations but
who are still struggling will naturally feel envious. You should be
reasonably tolerant of this because if the tables were reversed, you
would probably feel the same. Do not take so personally their faint
praise and veiled criticisms. But be aware that among some of these
peers envy can turn active and dangerous.
Renaissance artists who suddenly got commissions became targets
for envious rivals, who could turn quite vicious. Michelangelo clearly
envied the younger and talented Raphael and did what he could to
sully his reputation and block his commissions. Writers are
notoriously envious of other writers, particularly those with more
lucrative deals.
The best you can do in such situations is to have some self-
deprecating humor and to not rub people’s faces in your success,
which, after all, might contain some elements of luck. In fact, when
discussing your success with others who might envy you, always
emphasize or play up the element of luck. For those closest to you,
offer to help them in their struggles as best you can, without appearing
patronizing. In a similar vein, never make the mistake of praising a
writer in front of another writer, or an artist in front of an artist, unless
the person being praised is dead. If you detect signs of a more active
envy in peers, get as far away from them as possible.
Keep in mind that people who are getting older, with their careers
on the decline, have delicate egos and are quite prone to experiencing

[PAGE 314]
envy.
Sometimes it is people’s natural gifts and talents that will stir up the
most intense forms of envy. We can strive to become proficient in a
field, but we cannot reengineer our physiology. Some people are born
with better looks, more raw athletic skill, an unusually vivid
imagination, or an open and generous nature. If people with natural
gifts also possess a good work ethic and have some luck in life, envy
will follow them wherever they go. Often making it worse for such
types, they also tend to be quite naive. They themselves do not feel
envy toward others, so they cannot understand the emotion at all.
Unaware of the dangers, they naturally display their talents and attract
even more envy. Mary Shelley was all of this—gifted with a brilliant
imagination and superior intellectual capabilities, and also quite naive.
What is worse, envying types secretly loathe those who are immune to
feeling envy. It makes their envious nature doubly apparent to
themselves and stirs the desire to hurt and wound.
If you have any natural gifts that elevate you above others, you must
be aware of the dangers and avoid flaunting such talents. Instead you
want to strategically reveal some flaws to blunt people’s envy and mask
your natural superiority. If you are gifted in the sciences, make it clear
to others how you wish you had more social skills. Show your
intellectual clumsiness at subjects outside your expertise.
John F. Kennedy seemed almost too perfect to the American public.
So handsome, intelligent, and charismatic, and with such a beautiful
wife—it was hard to identify with or like him. As soon as he made his
big mistake in the failed invasion of Cuba (known as the Bay of Pigs)
early on in his administration, and took full responsibility for the
debacle, his poll numbers skyrocketed. The mistake had humanized
him. Although this was not done by design, you can have a similar
effect by discussing the mistakes you have made in the past and
showing some selective awkwardness in certain areas that do not
diminish your overall reputation.
Women who achieve success and fame are more prone to attracting
envy and hostility, although this will always be veiled as something else
—such women are said to be too cold, or ambitious, or unfeminine.
Oftentimes we choose to admire people who achieve great things,
admiration being the opposite of envy. We do not feel personally
challenged or insecure in the face of their excellence. We might also

[PAGE 315]
emulate them, use them as spurs toward trying to achieve more. But
unfortunately this is rarely the case with successful women. A high-
achieving woman inflicts greater feelings of inferiority in both other
women and men (“I’m inferior to a woman?”), which leads to envy and
hostility, not admiration.
Coco Chanel, the most successful businesswoman of her era,
especially considering her origins as an orphan (see chapter 5),
suffered from such envy her entire life. In 1931, at the height of her
power, she met Paul Iribe, an illustrator and designer whose career
was on the decline. Iribe was an expert seducer and they had much in
common. But several months into their relationship, he began to
criticize her for her extravagance and torment her about her other
flaws as he saw them. He wanted to control all aspects of her life.
Lonely and desperate for a relationship, she hung on, but she later
wrote of Iribe, “My growing celebrity eclipsed his declining glory. . . .
Iribe loved me with the secret hope of destroying me.” Love and envy
are not mutually exclusive.
Successful women will have to bear this burden until such
entrenched underlying values are changed. In the meantime, they will
have to be even more adept at deflecting envy and playing the humble
card.
Robert Rubin (b. 1938), two-term secretary of the treasury under
Bill Clinton, was a grand master when it came to masking his
excellence and defusing envy. He had begun his career at Goldman
Sachs in 1966, slowly rising through the ranks to become its cohead in
1990. He was one of the key figures who transformed Goldman Sachs
into the most powerful investment bank on Wall Street. He was a hard
worker and brilliant at finance, but as he became more powerful within
Goldman, he also became more deferential in all of his interactions. In
meetings in which he was clearly the most knowledgeable person, he
would make a point of asking for the opinions of the most junior
associate in attendance, and of listening to what he or she had to say
with rapt attention. When people who worked for him asked him what
should be done in relation to some crisis or problem, he would look at
them calmly and ask first, “What do you think?” He would take their
answer quite seriously.
As one colleague at Goldman later said of him, “There is no one
better at the humility shtick than Bob. The line, ‘just one’s man

[PAGE 316]
opinion’ was something he would utter a dozen times a day.” What is
remarkable is how Rubin earned the admiration of so many people and
how few had anything bad to say about him, considering the
competitive environment within the company. This reveals the power
you have to short-circuit envy by placing attention on other people
instead of yourself and engaging with them on a meaningful level.
If you find yourself under an envy attack, your best strategy is to
control your emotions. It is much easier to do this once you realize that
envy is the source. The envier feeds upon your overreaction as material
to criticize you, justify their actions, and entangle you in some further
drama. At all costs, maintain your composure. If possible, get some
physical distance as well—fire them, cut off contact, whatever is
possible. Do not imagine you can somehow repair the relationship.
Your generosity in trying this will only intensify their feelings of
inferiority. They will strike again. By all means defend yourself from
any public attacks or gossip that they spread, but do not harbor
revenge fantasies. The envier is miserable. The best strategy is let to
them stew in their “cold poison” from a distance, without any future
means of wounding you, as Mary did to Jane. Their chronic
unhappiness is punishment enough.
Finally, you might imagine that envy is a somewhat rare occurrence
in the modern world. After all, it is a primitive, childish emotion, and
we live in such sophisticated times. Furthermore, not many people
discuss or analyze envy as a major social factor. But the truth is that
envy is more prevalent now than ever before, largely because of social
media.
Through social media we have a continual window into the lives of
friends, pseudofriends, and celebrities. And what we see is not some
unvarnished peek into their world but a highly idealized image that
they present. We see only the most exciting images from their
vacations, the happy faces of their friends and children, accounts of
their continual self-improvement, the fascinating people they are
meeting, the great causes and projects they are involved in, the
examples of success in their endeavors. Are we having as much fun?
Are our lives as seemingly fulfilled as theirs? Are we perhaps missing
out on something? We generally believe, and for good reason, that we
are all entitled to share in the good life, but if our peers seem to have
more, someone or something must be to blame.

[PAGE 317]
What we experience in this case is a generalized feeling of
dissatisfaction. Low-grade envy sits inside us, waiting to be triggered
into the more acute variety if something we read or see intensifies our
insecurities. Such diffuse envy among large groups of people can even
become a political force, as demagogues can stir it against certain
individuals or groups of people who have or seem to have it easier than
others. People can be unified through their underlying envy, but as
with the personal variety, nobody will admit to this, nor will it ever be
seen as such. Public envy can be quickly turned against public figures,
especially in the form of schadenfreude when they experience some
misfortune. (Witness the piling on of hostility toward Martha Stewart
once she seemed to run afoul of the law.) Gossip about the powerful
becomes an industry.
What this means is simple: we will find more and more people
around us prone to feeling passive envy that can turn into the virulent
form if we are not careful. We must be prepared to feel its effects
coming from friends, colleagues, and the public if we are in the public
eye. In such an overheated social environment, learning to recognize
the signs and being able to identify envier types is an absolutely critical
skill to develop. And since we are now all more susceptible to feeling
envy ourselves, we must also learn how to manage this emotion within
ourselves, transforming it into something positive and productive.
Beyond Envy
Like most humans, you will tend to deny that you ever experience
envy, at least strong enough to act on. You are simply not being honest
with yourself. As described above, you are only conscious of the
indignation or resentment you feel that covers up the initial pangs of
envy. You need to overcome the natural resistance to seeing the
emotion as it first stirs within you.
We all compare ourselves with others; we all feel unsettled by those
who are superior in some area that we esteem; and we all react to this
by feeling some form of envy. (It is wired into our nature; studies have
shown that monkeys feel envy.) You can begin with a simple
experiment: next time you hear or read about the sudden success of
someone in your field, notice the inevitable feeling of wanting the same
(the pang) and the subsequent hostility, however vague, toward the
person you envy. It happens quickly and you can easily miss the

[PAGE 318]
transition, but try to catch it. It is natural to go through this emotional
sequence and there should be no guilt attached. Monitoring yourself
and seeing more such instances will only help you in the slow process
of moving beyond envy.
Let us be realistic, however, and realize that it is almost impossible
to rid ourselves of the compulsion to compare ourselves with others. It
is too ingrained in our nature as a social animal. Instead, what we must
aspire to is to slowly transform our comparing inclination into
something positive, productive, and prosocial. The following are five
simple exercises to help you in achieving this.
Move closer to what you envy. Envy thrives on relative closeness—in a
corporate environment where people see each other every day, in a
family, in a neighborhood, in any group of peers. But people tend to
hide their problems and to put their best face forward. We only see and
hear of their triumphs, their new relationships, their brilliant ideas
that will land them a gold mine. If we moved closer—if we saw the
quarrels that go on behind closed doors or the horrible boss that goes
with that new job—we would have less reason to feel envy. Nothing is
ever so perfect as it seems, and often we would see that we are
mistaken if we only looked closely enough. Spend time with that family
you envy and wish you had as your own, and you will begin to reassess
your opinion.
If you envy people with greater fame and attention, remind yourself
that with such attention comes a lot of hostility and scrutiny that is
quite painful. Wealthy people are often miserable. Read any account of
the last ten years of the life of Aristotle Onassis (1906–1975), one of the
wealthiest men in history, married to the glamorous Jacqueline
Kennedy, and you will see that his wealth brought him endless
nightmares, including the most spoiled and unloving of children.
The process of moving closer is twofold: on the one hand, try to
actually look behind the glittering façades people present, and on the
other hand, simply imagine the inevitable disadvantages that go along
with their position. This is not the same as leveling them down. You
are not diminishing the achievements of those who are great. You are
mitigating the envy you might feel for things in people’s personal lives.
Engage in downward comparisons. You normally focus on those who
seem to have more than you, but it would be wiser to look at those who
have less. There are always plenty of people to use for such a

[PAGE 319]
comparison. They live in harsher environments, deal with more threats
to their lives, and have deeper levels of insecurity about the future. You
can even look at friends who have it much worse than you. This should
stimulate not only empathy for the many who have less but also
greater gratitude for what you actually possess. Such gratitude is the
best antidote to envy.
As a related exercise, you can write up all the positive things in your
life that you tend to take for granted—the people who have been kind
and helpful to you, the health that you presently enjoy. Gratitude is a
muscle that requires exercise or it will atrophy.
Practice Mitfreude. Schadenfreude, the experience of pleasure in
the pain of other people, is distinctly related to envy, as several studies
have demonstrated. When we envy someone, we are prone to feel
excitement, even joy, if they experience a setback or suffer in some
way. But it would be wise to practice instead the opposite, what the
philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche called Mitfreude—“joying with.” As he
wrote, “The serpent that stings us means to hurt us and rejoices as it
does so; the lowest animal can imagine the pain of others. But to
imagine the joy of others and to rejoice at it is the highest privilege of
the highest animals.”
This means that instead of merely congratulating people on their
good fortune, something easy to do and easily forgotten, you must
instead actively try to feel their joy, as a form of empathy. This can be
somewhat unnatural, as our first tendency is to feel a pang of envy, but
we can train ourselves to imagine how it must feel to others to
experience their happiness or satisfaction. This not only cleans our
brain of ugly envy but also creates an unusual form of rapport. If we
are the targets of Mitfreude, we feel the other person’s genuine
excitement at our good fortune, instead of just hearing words, and it
induces us to feel the same for them. Because it is such a rare
occurrence, it contains great power to bond people. And in
internalizing other people’s joy, we increase our own capacity to feel
this emotion in relation to our own experiences.
Transmute envy into emulation. We cannot stop the comparing
mechanism in our brains, so it is best to redirect it into something
productive and creative. Instead of wanting to hurt or steal from the
person who has achieved more, we should desire to raise ourselves up
to his or her level. In this way, envy becomes a spur to excellence. We

[PAGE 320]
may even try to be around people who will stimulate such competitive
desires, people who are slightly above us in skill level.
To make this work requires a few psychological shifts. First, we
must come to believe that we have the capacity to raise ourselves up.
Confidence in our overall abilities to learn and improve will serve as a
tremendous antidote to envy. Instead of wishing to have what another
has and resorting to sabotage out of helplessness, we feel the urge to
get the same for ourselves and believe we have the ability to do so.
Second, we must develop a solid work ethic to back this up. If we are
rigorous and persistent, we will be able to overcome almost any
obstacle and elevate our position. People who are lazy and
undisciplined are much more prone to feeling envy.
Related to this, having a sense of purpose, a feel for your calling in
life, is a great way to immunize yourself against envy. You are focused
on your own life and plans, which are clear and invigorating. What
gives you satisfaction is realizing your potential, not earning attention
from the public, which is fleeting. You have much less need to
compare. Your sense of self-worth comes from within, not from
without.
Admire human greatness. Admiration is the polar opposite of envy—we
are acknowledging people’s achievements, celebrating them, without
having to feel insecure. We are admitting their superiority in the arts
or sciences or in business without feeling pain from this. But this goes
further. In recognizing the greatness of someone, we are celebrating
the highest potential of our species. We are experiencing Mitfreude
with the best in human nature. We share the pride that comes from
any great human achievement. Such admiration elevates us above the
pettiness of our day-to-day life and will have calming effect.
Although it is easier to admire without any taint of envy those who
are dead, we must try to include at least one living person in our
pantheon. If we are young enough, such objects of admiration can also
serve as models to emulate, at least to some degree.
Finally, it is worth cultivating moments in life in which we feel
immense satisfaction and happiness divorced from our own success or
achievements. This happens commonly when we find ourselves in a
beautiful landscape—the mountains, the sea, a forest. We do not feel
the prying, comparing eyes of others, the need to have more attention
or to assert ourselves. We are simply in awe of what we see, and it is

[PAGE 321]
intensely therapeutic. This can also occur when we contemplate the
immensity of the universe, the uncanny set of circumstances that had
to come together for us to be born, the vast reaches of time before us
and after us. These are sublime moments, and as far removed from the
pettiness and poisons of envy as possible.
For not many men . . . can love a friend who fortune prospers
without envying; and about the envious brain
cold poison clings and doubles all the pain
life brings him. His own woundings he must nurse,
and feel another’s gladness like a curse.
—Aeschylus

Know Your Limits
The Law of Grandiosity
We humans have a deep need to think highly of ourselves. If that
opinion of our goodness, greatness, and brilliance diverges
enough from reality, we become grandiose. We imagine our
superiority. Often a small measure of success will elevate our natural
grandiosity to even more dangerous levels. Our high self-opinion has
now been confirmed by events. We forget the role that luck may have
played in the success, or the contributions of others. We imagine we
have the golden touch. Losing contact with reality, we make
irrational decisions. That is why our success often does not last. Look
for the signs of elevated grandiosity in yourself and in others—
overbearing certainty in the positive outcome of your plans; excessive
touchiness if criticized; a disdain for any form of authority.
Counteract the pull of grandiosity by maintaining a realistic
assessment of yourself and your limits. Tie any feelings of greatness
to your work, your achievements, and your contributions to society.
The Success Delusion
By the summer of 1984, Michael Eisner (b. 1942), president of
Paramount Pictures, could no longer ignore the restlessness that had
been plaguing him for months. He was impatient to move on to a
bigger stage and shake the foundations of Hollywood. This restlessness
had been the story of his life. He had begun his career at ABC, and
never settling too comfortably within one department, after nine years
of various promotions he had risen to the position of head of prime-
time programming. But television began to seem small and
constricting to him. He needed a larger, grander stage. In 1976 Barry

[PAGE 323]
Diller—a former boss at ABC and now the chairman of Paramount
Pictures—offered him the job of heading Paramount’s film studio, and
he jumped at the chance.
Paramount had long been in the doldrums, but working with Diller,
Eisner transformed it into the hottest studio in Hollywood, with a
string of remarkably successful films—Saturday Night Fever, Grease,
Flashdance, and Terms of Endearment. Although Diller certainly
played a part in this turnaround, Eisner saw himself as the main
driving force behind the studio’s success. After all, he had invented a
surefire formula for creating profitable films.
The formula depended on keeping costs down, an obsession of his.
To do so, a film had to begin with a great concept, one that was
original, easy to summarize, and dramatic. Executives could hire the
most expensive writers, directors, and actors for a film, but if the
underlying concept was weak, all the money in the world would be
wasted. Films with a strong concept, however, would market
themselves. A studio could churn these relatively inexpensive films out
in volume, and even if they were only moderate hits, they would ensure
a steady flow of income. This thinking went against the grain of the
blockbuster mentality of the late 1970s, but who could argue with the
undeniable profits Eisner had generated for Paramount? Eisner
immortalized this formula in a memo that soon spread around
Hollywood and became gospel.
But after so many years of sharing the limelight with Diller at
Paramount, trying to please corporate CEOs, and pushing back against
marketing directors and finance people, Eisner had had enough. If
only he could run his own studio, unfettered. With the formula he had
created and with his relentless ambition, he could forge the greatest
and most profitable entertainment empire in the world. He was tired of
other people piggybacking on his ideas and success. Operating on top
and alone, he could control the show and take all the credit.
As Eisner contemplated this next critical move in his career that
summer of ’84, he finally settled upon the perfect target for his
ambitions—the Walt Disney Company. At first glance, this would seem
a puzzling choice. Since the death of Walt Disney in 1966, the Walt
Disney film studio seemed frozen in time, getting weirder with each
passing year. The place operated more like a stodgy men’s club. Many
executives stopped working after lunch and spent their afternoons in

[PAGE 324]
card games, or would lounge about in the steam room on site. Hardly
anyone was ever fired. The studio produced one animated film about
every four years and in 1983 produced a meager three live-action films.
They had not had a single hit film since The Love Bug in 1968. The
Disney lot in Burbank almost seemed like a ghost town. The actor Tom
Hanks, who worked on the lot in 1983, described it as “a Greyhound
bus station in the 1950s.”
Given its dilapidated condition, however, this would be the perfect
place for Eisner to work his magic. The studio and the corporation
could only move up. Its board members were desperate to turn it
around and avoid a hostile takeover. Eisner could dictate the terms of
his leadership position. Presenting himself to Roy Disney (Walt’s
nephew and the largest shareholder of Disney stock) as the company’s
savior, he laid out a detailed and inspiring plan for a dramatic
turnaround (greater than Paramount’s), and Roy was won over. With
Roy’s blessing the board approved the choice, and in September 1984
Eisner was named chairman and CEO of the Walt Disney Company.
Frank Wells, the former head of Warner Bros., was named president
and chief operating officer. Wells would focus on the business side. In
all matters Eisner was the boss; Wells was there to help and serve him.
Eisner wasted no time. He embarked on a major restructuring of
the company, which led to the departure of over a thousand employees.
He started filling the executive ranks with Paramount people, most
notably Jeffrey Katzenberg (b. 1950), who had worked as Eisner’s
right-hand man at Paramount and was now named chairman of Walt
Disney Studios. Katzenberg could be abrasive and downright rude, but
no one in Hollywood was more efficient or worked harder. He simply
got things done.
Within months Disney began to churn out a remarkable series of
hits, adhering to Eisner’s formula. Fifteen of its first seventeen films
(such as Down and Out in Beverly Hills and Who Framed Roger
Rabbit) generated profits, a run of success almost unheard of for any
studio in Hollywood.
One day, as Eisner explored the Burbank lot with Wells, they
entered the Disney library and discovered hundreds of cartoons from
the golden era that had never been shown. There on endless shelves
were stored all of the great Disney classic animated hits. Eisner’s eyes
lit up at the sight of this treasure. He could reissue all of these cartoons

[PAGE 325]
and animated films on video (the home video market was in the midst
of exploding) and it would be pure profit. Based on these cartoons, the
company could create stores to market the various Disney characters.
Disney was a virtual gold mine waiting to be exploited, and Eisner
would make the most of this.
Soon the stores opened, the videos sold like crazy, the film hits kept
pumping profit into the company, and Disney’s stock price soared. It
had replaced Paramount as the hottest film studio in town. Wanting to
cultivate a more public presence, Eisner decided to revive the old The
Wonderful World of Disney, an hourlong television show from the
fifties and sixties hosted by Walt Disney himself. This time Eisner
would be the host. He was not a natural in front of the camera, but he
felt audiences would grow to like him. He could be comforting to
children, like Walt himself. In fact, he began to feel the two of them
were somehow magically connected, as if he were more than just the
head of the corporation but rather the natural son and successor to
Walt Disney himself.
Despite all his success, however, the old restlessness returned. He
needed a new venture, a bigger challenge, and soon he found it. The
Walt Disney Company had plans to create a new theme park in Europe.
The last one to open, Tokyo Disneyland in 1983, had been a success.
Those in charge of theme parks had settled upon two potential sites for
the new Disneyland—one near Barcelona, Spain, the other near Paris.
Although the Barcelona site made more economic sense, since the
weather there was much better, Eisner chose the French site. This was
going to be more than a theme park. This was going to be a cultural
statement. He would hire the best architects in the world. Unlike the
usual fiberglass castles at the other theme parks, at Euro Disney—as it
came to be known—the castles would be built out of pink stone and
feature handcrafted stained-glass windows with scenes from various
fairy tales. It would be a place even snobby French elites would be
excited to visit. Eisner loved architecture, and here he could be a
modern-day Medici.
As the years went by, the cost of Euro Disney mounted. Letting go
of his usual obsession with the bottom line, Eisner felt that if he built it
right, the crowds would come and the park would eventually pay for
itself. But when it finally opened as planned in 1992, it quickly became
clear that Eisner had not understood French tastes and vacation
habits. The French were not so willing to wait in line for rides,

[PAGE 326]
particularly in bad weather. As in the other theme parks, no beer or
wine was served on the premises, and that seemed like sacrilege to the
French. The hotel rooms were too expensive for a family to stay there
more than a night. And despite all the attention to detail, the pink
stone castles still looked like kitschy versions of the originals.
Attendance was only half of what Eisner had anticipated. The debts
Disney had incurred in the construction had ballooned, and the money
coming in from visitors could not even service the interest on them. It
was shaping up to be a disaster, the first ever in his glorious career. As
he finally came to terms with this reality, he decided that Frank Wells
was to blame. It was his job to oversee the financial health of the
project, and he had failed. Whereas before Eisner had only had the
best things to say about their working relationship, now he often
complained about his second-in-command and contemplated firing
him.
In the middle of this growing debacle, Eisner felt a new threat on
the horizon—Jeffrey Katzenberg. He had once referred to Katzenberg
as his golden retriever—so loyal and hardworking. It was Katzenberg
who had overseen the string of early hits for the studio, including the
biggest hit of all, Beauty and the Beast, the film that had initiated the
renaissance of Disney’s animation department. But something about
Katzenberg was making him increasingly nervous. Perhaps it was the
memo that Katzenberg had written in 1990, in which he dissected the
string of flops Disney had recently produced in live action. “Since 1984,
we have slowly drifted away from our original vision of how to run a
business,” he wrote. Katzenberg criticized the studio’s decision to go
for bigger-budget films such as Dick Tracy, trying to make “event
movies.” Disney had fallen for “the blockbuster mentality” and had lost
its soul in the process.
The memo made Eisner uncomfortable. Dick Tracy was Eisner’s
own pet project. Was Katzenberg indirectly criticizing his boss? When
he thought about it, it seemed like this was a clear imitation of his own
infamous memo at Paramount, in which he had advocated for less
expensive, high-concept films. Now it occurred to him that Katzenberg
saw himself as the next Eisner. Maybe he was angling to take Eisner’s
job, to subtly undermine his authority. This began to eat away at him.
Why was Katzenberg now cutting him out of story meetings?

[PAGE 327]
The animation department soon became the primary generator of
profits for the studio, with new hits such as Aladdin and now The Lion
King, which had been Katzenberg’s baby—he had come up with the
story idea and developed it from start to finish. Magazine articles now
began to feature Katzenberg as if he were the creative genius behind
Disney’s resurgence in the genre. What about Roy Disney, the vice
chairman of animation? What about Eisner himself, who was in charge
of everything? To Eisner, Katzenberg was now playing the media,
building himself up. An executive had reported to Eisner that
Katzenberg was going around saying, “I’m the Walt Disney of today.”
Suspicion soon turned into hatred. Eisner could not stand to be around
him.
Then, in March of 1994, Frank Wells was killed in a helicopter
accident while on a skiing trip. To reassure shareholders and Wall
Street, Eisner soon announced that he would take over Wells’s position
as president. But suddenly here was Katzenberg pestering him with
phone calls and memos, reminding Eisner that he had promised him
the president’s job if Wells ever left the company. How insensitive, so
soon after the tragedy. He stopped returning Katzenberg’s phone calls.
Finally, in August 1994, Eisner fired Jeffrey Katzenberg, shocking
almost everyone in Hollywood. He had fired the most successful studio
executive in town. The Lion King had become one of the most
profitable films in Hollywood history. It was Katzenberg who was
behind Disney’s acquisition of Miramax, considered a great coup with
the ensuing success of Pulp Fiction. It seemed like madness on his
part, but Eisner did not care. Finally freed of Katzenberg’s shadow, he
could relax and now take Disney to the next level, on his own and with
no more distractions.
To prove he had not lost his touch, he soon dazzled the
entertainment world by engineering Disney’s purchase of ABC. The
sheer audacity of this coup once again made him the center of
attention. Now he was forging an entertainment empire beyond what
anyone had ever attempted or imagined. This move, however, created
a problem for him. The company had virtually doubled in size. It was
too complex, too big for one man. Only a year earlier he had undergone
open-heart surgery, and he could not handle the added stress.
He needed another Frank Wells, and his thoughts soon turned to
his old friend Michael Ovitz, one of the founders and the head of

[PAGE 328]
Creative Artists Agency. Ovitz was the greatest deal maker in
Hollywood history, perhaps the most powerful man in town. Together
they could dominate the field. Many within the business warned him
against this hire—Ovitz was not like Frank Wells; he was not a finance
guy or a master of detail, as Ovitz himself would have admitted. Eisner
ignored such advice. People were being too conventional in their
thinking. He decided to lure Ovitz away from CAA with a very lucrative
package and offer him the title of president. He assured Ovitz in
several discussions that although Ovitz would be second in command,
they would eventually run the company as coleaders.
In a phone call Ovitz finally agreed to all of the terms, but the
moment Eisner hung up, he realized he had made the biggest mistake
of his life. What had he been thinking? They might have been the
closest of friends, but how would two such larger-than-life men ever be
able to work together? Ovitz was power hungry. This would be the
Katzenberg problem times two. It was too late, however. He had gotten
the board’s approval for the hire. His own reputation, his decision-
making process as a CEO, was at stake. He would have to make it work.
He quickly decided upon a strategy—he would narrow Ovitz’s
responsibilities, keep a tight leash on him, and make him prove himself
as president. By doing so Ovitz could earn Eisner’s trust and get more
power. From day one Eisner wanted to signal to Ovitz who was boss.
Instead of moving him into Frank Wells’s old office on the sixth floor
at Disney headquarters, next to Eisner’s, Eisner put him in a rather
unimpressive office on the fifth floor. Ovitz liked to spread money
around with gifts and lavish parties to charm people; Eisner had his
team monitor every penny that Ovitz spent on such things, and watch
his every move. Was Ovitz contacting other executives behind Eisner’s
back? He would not nurture another Katzenberg at his breast.
Soon the following dynamic developed: Ovitz would approach him
with some potential deal, and Eisner would not discourage him from
exploring it. But once it came time to agree to the deal, Eisner would
give a firm no. Slowly word spread through the industry that Ovitz had
lost his touch and could no longer close a deal. Ovitz began to panic.
He wanted desperately to prove he had been worthy of the choice. He
offered to move to New York to help manage ABC, since the merger of
the two companies was not working out so smoothly, but Eisner said
no. He told his lieutenants to keep their distance from Ovitz. He was
not a man to be trusted—he was the son of a liquor salesman in the San

[PAGE 329]
Fernando Valley, and like his father, Ovitz was just a smooth salesman.
He was addicted to attention from the media. Within the company,
Ovitz had become completely isolated.
As the months dragged on in this saga, Ovitz could see what was
happening, and he complained bitterly to Eisner. He had left his
agency for Disney; he had staked his reputation on what he would do
as president, and Eisner was destroying his reputation. Nobody
respected him any longer in the business. Eisner’s treatment of Ovitz
was downright sadistic. In Eisner’s mind, however, Ovitz had failed the
test he had laid out; he had not proven himself to be patient; he was no
Frank Wells. In December of 1996, after a mere fourteen months on
the job, Ovitz was fired, taking with him an enormous severance
package. It was a dizzying and rapid fall from grace.
Finally liberated from this great mistake, Eisner began to
consolidate power within the company. ABC was not doing so well. He
would have to intervene and take some control. He began to attend
programming meetings; he talked of his own golden days at ABC and
of the great shows he had created there, such as Laverne & Shirley and
Happy Days. ABC needed to go back to that earlier philosophy and
create high-concept shows for the family.
As the internet began to take off, Eisner had to get involved in a big
way. He nixed the purchase of Yahoo!, pushed by his executives.
Instead Disney would start its own internet portal, called Go. Over the
years he had learned the lesson—it was always best to design and run
your own show. Disney would dominate the internet. He had proven
himself a turnaround genius twice before, and with Disney now in a
slump, he would do it a third time.
Soon, however, a wave of disasters hit the corporation, one after
another. After being fired, Katzenberg had sued Disney for the bonus—
based on performance—he was due under his contract. When he had
been president, Ovitz had tried to settle the suit before it went to court
and had gotten Katzenberg to agree to $90 million, but at the last
minute Eisner had nixed this, certain he did not owe Katzenberg
anything. In 2001 the judge ruled in Katzenberg’s favor, and they had
to settle for a whopping $280 million. Disney had poured vast
resources into the creation of Go, and it was a terrific flop that had to
be shut down. The costs from Euro Disney were still bleeding the
company. Disney had a partnership with Pixar, and together they had

[PAGE 330]
produced such hits as Toy Story. But now the CEO of Pixar, Steve
Jobs, made it clear he would never work with Disney again, deeply
resenting Eisner’s micromanaging. ABC was underperforming. Most of
the movies Disney produced were not just flops but expensive flops,
culminating in the biggest one of all, Pearl Harbor, which opened in
May of 2001.
Suddenly it seemed that Roy Disney had lost faith in Eisner. The
stock price was plummeting. He told Eisner it would be best for him to
resign. What ingratitude, what hubris! He, Eisner, was the man who
had singlehandedly brought the company back from the dead. He had
saved Roy from disaster and made him a fortune, Roy who had been
considered Walt’s idiot nephew. And now, in Eisner’s darkest hour,
Roy was going to betray him? Eisner had never felt more enraged. He
quickly struck back, forcing Roy to resign from the board. This only
seemed to embolden Roy. He organized a shareholder revolt known as
Save Disney, and in March of 2004 the shareholders voted a stinging
rebuke of Eisner’s leadership.
Soon the board decided to strip Eisner of his position as chairman
of the board. The empire he had forged was falling apart. In September
of 2005, with hardly an ally to lean on and feeling alone and betrayed,
Eisner officially resigned from Disney. How had it all unraveled so
quickly? They would come to miss him, he told friends, and he meant
all of Hollywood; there would never be another like him.

Interpretation: We can say that at a certain point in his career
Michael Eisner succumbed to a form of delusion when it came to
power, his thinking so divorced from reality that he made business
decisions with disastrous consequences. Let us follow the progress of
this particular form of delusion as it emerged and took over his mind.
At the beginning of his career at ABC, young Eisner had a solid
grasp on reality. He was fiercely practical. He understood and
exploited to the maximum his strengths—his ambitious and
competitive nature, his intense work ethic, his keen sense for the
entertainment tastes of the average American. Eisner had a quick mind
and the ability to encourage others to think creatively. Leaning on
these strengths, he rose quickly up the ladder. He possessed a high
degree of confidence in his talents, and the series of promotions he

[PAGE 331]
received at ABC confirmed this self-opinion. He could afford to be a
little cocky, because he had learned a lot on the job and his skills as a
programmer had improved immensely. He was on a fast track toward
the top, which he reached at the age of thirty-four by being named
head of prime-time programming at ABC.
As a person of high ambition, he soon felt that the world of
television was somewhat constricting. There were limits to the kinds of
entertainment he could program. The film world offered something
looser, greater, and more glamorous. It was natural, then, for him to
accept the position at Paramount. But at Paramount something
occurred that began the subtle process of the unbalancing of his mind.
Because the stage was bigger and he was the head of the studio, he
began to receive attention from the media and the public. He was
featured on the cover of magazines as the hottest film executive in
Hollywood. This was qualitatively different from the attention and
satisfaction that had come from the promotions at ABC. Now he had
millions of people admiring him. How could their opinions be wrong?
To them he was a genius, a new kind of hero altering the landscape of
the studio system.
This was intoxicating. It inevitably elevated his estimation of his
skills. But it came with a great danger. The success that Eisner had had
at Paramount was not completely of his own doing. When he had
arrived at the studio, several films were already in preproduction,
including Saturday Night Fever, which would spark the turnaround.
Barry Diller was the perfect foil to Eisner. He would argue with him
endlessly about his ideas, forcing Eisner to sharpen them. But puffed
up by the attention he was receiving, Eisner had to imagine that he
deserved the accolades he received strictly for his own efforts, and so
naturally he subtracted from his success the elements of good timing
and the contributions of others. Now his mind was subtly divorcing
itself from reality. Instead of rigorously focusing on the audience and
how to entertain people, he started to increasingly focus on himself,
believing in the myth of his greatness as promulgated by others. He
imagined he had the golden touch.
At Disney the pattern repeated and grew more intense. He basked
in the glow of his amazing success there, quickly forgetting the
incredible good luck he had had in inheriting the Disney library at the
time of the explosion of home video and family entertainment. He
discounted the critical role that Wells had played in balancing him out.

[PAGE 332]
With his sense of grandeur growing, he faced a dilemma. He had
become addicted to the attention that came from creating a splash,
doing something big. He could not content himself with simple success
and rising profits. He had to add to the myth to keep it alive. Euro
Disney would be the answer. He would show the world he was not just
a corporate executive but rather a renaissance man.
In building the park, he refused to listen to experienced advisers
who recommended the Barcelona site and advocated a modest theme
park to keep the costs down. He did not pay attention to French
culture but directed everything from Burbank. He operated under the
belief that his skills as the head of a film studio could be transferred to
theme parks and architecture. He was certainly overestimating his
creative powers, and now his business decisions revealed a large
enough detachment from reality to qualify as delusional. Once this
mental imbalance takes hold, it can only get worse, because to come
back down to earth is to admit that one’s earlier high self-opinion was
wrong, and the human animal will almost never admit that. Instead,
the tendency is to blame others for every failure or setback.
In the grips now of his delusion, he made his most serious mistake
of all—the firing of Jeffrey Katzenberg. The Disney system depended
on a steady flow of new animated hits, which fed the stores and theme
parks with new characters, merchandise, rides, and avenues for
publicity. Katzenberg clearly had developed the knack for creating such
hits, exemplified by the unprecedented success of The Lion King.
Firing him put the entire assembly line at risk. Who would take over?
Certainly not Roy Disney or Eisner himself? Furthermore, he had to
know that Katzenberg would take his skills elsewhere, which he did
when he cofounded a new studio, DreamWorks. There he churned out
more animated hits. The new studio drove up the price for skilled
animators, vastly increasing the cost of producing an animated film
and threatening Disney’s entire profit system. But instead of a firm
grip on this reality, Eisner was more focused on the competition for
attention. Katzenberg’s rise threatened his elevated self-opinion, and
he had to sacrifice profit and practicality to soothe his ego.
The downward spiral had begun. The acquisition of ABC, under the
belief that bigger is better, revealed his growing detachment from
reality. Television was a dying business model in the age of new media.
It was not a realistic business decision but a play for publicity. He had
created an entertainment behemoth, a blob without any clear identity.

[PAGE 333]
The hiring and firing of Ovitz revealed an even greater level of
delusion. People had become mere instruments for Eisner to use. Ovitz
was considered the most feared and powerful man in Hollywood.
Perhaps Eisner was unconsciously driven by the desire to humiliate
Ovitz. If he had the power to make Ovitz beg for crumbs, he must be
the most powerful man in Hollywood.
Soon all of the problems that stemmed from his delusional thought
process began to cascade—the continually rising costs of Euro Disney,
the Katzenberg bonus, the lack of hits in both film divisions, the
continual drain on resources from ABC, the Ovitz severance package.
The board members could no longer ignore the falling stock price. The
firing of Katzenberg and Ovitz made Eisner the most hated man in
Hollywood, and as his fortunes fell, all of his enemies came out of the
woodwork to hasten his destruction. His fall from power was fast and
spectacular.
Understand: The story of Michael Eisner is much closer to you
than you think. His fate could easily be yours, albeit most likely on a
smaller scale. The reason is simple: we humans possess a weakness
that is latent in us all and will push us into the delusional process
without our ever being aware of the dynamic. The weakness stems
from our natural tendency to overestimate our skills. We normally
have a self-opinion that is somewhat elevated in relation to reality. We
have a deep need to feel ourselves superior to others in something—
intelligence, beauty, charm, popularity, or saintliness. This can be a
positive. A degree of confidence impels us to take on challenges, to
push past our supposed limits, and to learn in the process. But once we
experience success on any level—increased attention from an
individual or group, a promotion, funding for a project—that
confidence will tend to rise too quickly, and there will be an ever-
growing discrepancy between our self-opinion and reality.
Any success that we have in life inevitably depends on some good
luck, timing, the contributions of others, the teachers who helped us
along the way, the whims of the public in need of something new. Our
tendency is to forget all of this and imagine that any success stems
from our superior self. We begin to assume we can handle new
challenges well before we are ready. After all, people have confirmed
our greatness with their attention, and we want to keep it coming. We
imagine we have the golden touch and that we can now magically
transfer our skills to some other medium or field. Without realizing it,

[PAGE 334]
we become more attuned to our ego and our fantasies than to the
people we work for and our audience. We grow distant from those who
are helping us, seeing them as tools to be used. And with any failures
that occur we tend to blame others. Success has an irresistible pull to it
that tends to cloud our minds.
Your task is the following: After any kind of success, analyze the
components. See the element of luck that is inevitably there, as well as
the role that other people, including mentors, played in your good
fortune. This will neutralize the tendency to inflate your powers.
Remind yourself that with success comes complacency, as attention
becomes more important than the work and old strategies are
repeated. With success you must raise your vigilance. Wipe the slate
clean with each new project, starting from zero. Try to pay less
attention to the applause as it grows louder. See the limits to what you
can accomplish and embrace them, working with what you have. Don’t
believe bigger is better; consolidating and concentrating your forces is
often the wiser choice. Be wary of offending with your growing sense of
superiority—you will need your allies. Compensate for the drug-like
effect of success by keeping your feet planted firmly on the ground. The
power you will build up in this slow and organic way will be more real
and lasting. Remember: the gods are merciless with those who fly too
high on the wings of grandiosity, and they will make you pay the price.
Existence alone had never been enough for him; he had always wanted
more. Perhaps it was only from the force of his desires that he had regarded
himself as a man to whom more was permitted than to others.
—Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Crime and Punishment
Keys to Human Nature
Let us say that you have a project to realize, or an individual or group
of people you wish to persuade to do something. We could describe a
realistic attitude toward reaching such goals in the following way:
Getting what you want is rarely easy. Success will depend on a lot of
effort and some luck. To make your project work, you will probably
have to jettison your previous strategy—circumstances are always
changing and you need to keep an open mind. The people you are
trying to reach never respond exactly as you might have imagined or
hoped. In fact, people will generally surprise and frustrate you in their
reactions. They have their own needs, experiences, and particular
psychology that are different from your own. To impress your targets,

[PAGE 335]
you will have to focus on them and their spirit. If you fail to accomplish
what you want, you will have to examine carefully what you did wrong
and strive to learn from the experience.
You can think of the project or task ahead of you as a block of
marble you must sculpt into something precise and beautiful. The
block is much larger than you and the material is quite resistant, but
the task is not impossible. With enough effort, focus, and resiliency
you can slowly carve it into what you need. You must begin, however,
with a proper sense of proportion—goals are hard to reach, people are
resistant, and you have limits to what you can do. With such a realistic
attitude, you can summon up the requisite patience and get to work.
Imagine, however, that your brain has succumbed to a
psychological disease that affects your perception of size and
proportion. Instead of seeing the task you are facing as rather large
and the material resistant, under the influence of this disease you
perceive the block of marble as relatively small and malleable. Losing
your sense of proportion, you believe it won’t take long to fashion the
block into the image you have in your mind of the finished product.
You imagine that the people you are trying to reach are not naturally
resistant but quite predictable. You know how they’ll respond to your
great idea—they’ll love it. In fact, they need you and your work more
than you need them. They should seek you out. The emphasis is not on
what you need to do to succeed but on what you feel you deserve. You
can foresee a lot of attention coming your way with this project, but if
you fail, other people must be to blame, because you have gifts, your
cause is the right one, and only those who are malicious or envious
could stand in your way.
We can call this psychological disease grandiosity. As you feel its
effects, the normal realistic proportions are reversed—your self
becomes larger and greater than anything else around it. That is the
lens through which you view the task and the people you need to reach.
This is not merely deep narcissism (see chapter 2), in which everything
must revolve around you. This is seeing yourself as enlarged (the root
of the word grandiosity meaning “big” or “great”), as superior and
worthy of not only attention but of being adored. It is a feeling of being
not merely human but godlike.
You may think of powerful, egotistical leaders in the public eye as
the ones who contract such a disease, but you would be very wrong in

[PAGE 336]
that assumption. Certainly we find many influential people, such as
Michael Eisner, with high-grade versions of grandiosity, where the
attention and accolades they receive create a more intense
enlargement of the self. But there is a low-grade, everyday version of
the disease that is common to almost all of us because it is a trait
embedded in human nature. It stems from our deep need to feel
important, esteemed by people, and superior to others in something.
You are rarely aware of your own grandiosity because by its nature
it alters your perception of reality and makes it hard to have an
accurate assessment of yourself. And so you are unaware of the
problems it might be causing you at this very moment. Your low-grade
grandiosity will cause you to overestimate your own skills and abilities
and to underestimate the obstacles that you face. And so you will take
on tasks that are beyond your actual capacity. You will feel certain that
people will respond to your idea in a particular way, and when they
don’t, you will become upset and blame others.
You may become restless and suddenly make a career change, not
realizing that grandiosity is at the root—your present work is not
confirming your greatness and superiority, because to be truly great
would require more years of training and the development of new
skills. Better to quit and be lured by the possibilities a new career
offers, allowing you to entertain fantasies of greatness. In this way, you
never quite master anything. You may have dozens of great ideas that
you never attempt to execute, because that would cause you to
confront the reality of your actual skill level. Without being aware of it,
you might become ever so slightly passive—you expect other people to
understand you, give you what you want, treat you well. Instead of
earning their praise, you feel entitled to it.
In all of these cases, your low-grade grandiosity will prevent you
from learning from your mistakes and developing yourself, because
you begin with the assumption that you are already large and great,
and it is too difficult to admit otherwise.
Your task as a student of human nature is threefold: First, you must
understand the phenomenon of grandiosity itself, why it is so
embedded in human nature, and why you will find many more
grandiose people in the world today than ever before. Second, you
need to recognize the signs of grandiosity and know how to manage the
people who display them. And third and most important, you must see

[PAGE 337]
the signs of the disease in yourself and learn not only how to control
your grandiose tendencies but also how to channel this energy into
something productive (see “Practical Grandiosity,” on this page, for
more on this).
According to the renowned psychoanalyst Heinz Kohut (1913–
1981), grandiosity has its roots in the earliest years of our life. In our
first months, most of us bonded completely with our mother. We had
no sense of a separate identity. She met our every need. We came to
believe that the breast that gave us food was actually a part of
ourselves. We were omnipotent—all we had to do was feel hungry or
feel any need, and the mother was there to meet it, as if we had magical
powers to control her. But then, slowly, we had to go through a second
phase of life in which we were forced to confront the reality—our
mother was a separate being who had other people to attend to. We
were not omnipotent but rather weak, quite small, and dependent.
This realization was painful and the source of much of our acting out—
we had a deep need to assert ourselves, to show we were not so
helpless, and to fantasize about powers we did not possess. (Children
will often imagine the ability to see through walls, to fly, or to read
people’s minds, and that is why they are drawn to stories of
superheroes.)
As we get older, we may not be physically small anymore, but our
sense of insignificance only gets worse. We come to realize we are one
person not just in a larger family, school, or city but in an entire globe
filled with billions of people. Our lives are relatively short. We have
limited skills and brainpower. There is so much we cannot control,
particularly with our careers and global trends. The idea that we will
die and be quickly forgotten, swallowed up in eternity, is quite
intolerable. We want to feel significant in some way, to protest against
our natural smallness, to expand our sense of self. What we
experienced at the age of three or four unconsciously haunts us our
entire lives. We alternate between moments of sensing our smallness
and trying to deny it. This makes us prone to finding ways to imagine
our superiority.
Some children do not go through that second phase in early
childhood in which they must confront their relative smallness, and
these children are more vulnerable to deeper forms of grandiosity later
in life. They are the pampered, spoiled ones. The mother and the father
continue to make such children feel like they are the center of the

[PAGE 338]
universe, shielding them from the pain of confronting the reality. Their
every wish becomes a command. If ever attempts are made to instill
the slightest amount of discipline, the parents are met with a tantrum.
Furthermore, such children come to disdain any form of authority.
Compared with themselves and what they can get, the father figure
seems rather weak.
This early pampering marks them for life. They need to be adored.
They become masters at manipulating others to pamper them and
shower them with attention. They naturally feel greater than anyone
above them. If they have any talent, they might rise quite far, as their
sense of being born with a crown on their head becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy. Unlike others, they never really alternate between feelings of
smallness and greatness; they know only the latter. Certainly Eisner
came from such a background, as he had a mother who met his every
need, completed his homework for him, and sheltered him from his
cold and sometimes cruel father.
In the past, we humans were able to channel our grandiose needs
into religion. In ancient times, our sense of smallness was not just
something bred into us by the many years we spent dependent on our
parents; it also came from our weakness in relation to the hostile
powers in nature. Gods and spirits represented these elemental powers
of nature that dwarfed our own. By worshipping them we could gain
their protection. Connected to something much larger than ourselves,
we felt enlarged. After all, the gods or God cared about the fate of our
tribe or city; they cared about our individual soul, a sign of our own
significance. We did not merely die and disappear. Many centuries
later, in a similar manner, we channeled this energy into worshipping
leaders who represented a great cause and promoted a future utopia,
such as Napoleon Bonaparte and the French Revolution, or Mao
Zedong and communism.
Today, in the Western world, religions and great causes have lost
their binding power; we find it hard to believe in them and to satisfy
our grandiose energy through identification with a greater power. The
need to feel larger and significant, however, does not simply disappear;
it is stronger than ever. And absent any other channels, people will
tend to direct this energy toward themselves. They will find a way to
expand their sense of self, to feel great and superior. Although rarely
conscious of this, what they are choosing to idealize and worship is the

[PAGE 339]
self. Because of this, we find more and more grandiose individuals
among us.
Other factors have also contributed to increases in grandiosity.
First, we find more people who experienced pampering attention in
their childhood than ever in the past. Feeling like they were once the
center of the universe becomes a hard thing to shake. They come to
believe that anything they do or produce should be seen as precious
and worthy of attention. Second, we find increasing numbers of people
who have little or no respect for authority or experts of any kind, no
matter the experts’ level of training and experience, which they
themselves lack. “Why should their opinion be any more valid than my
own?” they might tell themselves. “Nobody’s really that great; people
with power are just more privileged.” “My writing and music are just as
legitimate and worthy as anyone else’s.” Without a sense of anyone
rightly being above them and deserving authority, they can position
themselves among the highest.
Third, technology gives us the impression that everything in life can
be as fast and simple as the information we can glean online. It instills
the belief that we no longer have to spend years learning a skill;
instead, through a few tricks and with a few hours a week of practice
we can become proficient at anything. Similarly, people believe that
their skills can easily be transferred: “My ability to write means I can
also direct a film.” But more than anything it is social media that
spreads the grandiosity virus. Through social media we have almost
limitless powers to expand our presence, to create the illusion that we
have the attention and even adoration of thousands or millions of
people. We can possess the fame and ubiquity of the kings and queens
in the past, or even of the gods themselves.
With all of these elements combined, it is harder than ever for any
of us to maintain a realistic attitude and a proportionate sense of self.
In looking at the people around you, you must realize that their
grandiosity (and yours) can come in many different forms. Most
commonly people will try to satisfy the need by gaining social prestige.
People may claim they are interested in the work itself or in
contributing to humanity, but often deep down what is really
motivating them is the desire to have attention, to have their high self-
opinion confirmed by others who admire them, to feel powerful and
inflated. If they are talented, such types can get the attention they need

[PAGE 340]
for several years or longer, but inevitably, as in the story of Eisner,
their need for accolades will lure them into overreaching.
If people are disappointed in their careers yet still believe they are
great and unrecognized, they may turn to various compensations—
drugs, alcohol, sex with as many partners as possible, shopping, a
superior, mocking attitude, et cetera. Those with unsatisfied
grandiosity will often become filled with manic energy—one moment
telling everyone about the great screenplays they will write or the many
women they will seduce, and the next moment falling into depression
as reality intrudes.
People still tend to idealize leaders and worship them, and you must
see this as a form of grandiosity. By believing someone else will make
everything great, followers can feel something of this greatness. Their
minds can soar along with the rhetoric of the leader. They can feel
superior to those who are not believers. On a more personal level,
people will often idealize those they love, elevating them to god or
goddess status and by extension feeling some of this power reflected
back on them.
In the world today, you will also notice the prevalence of negative
forms of grandiosity. Many people feel the need to disguise their
grandiose urges not only from others but also from themselves. They
will frequently make a show of their humility—they are not interested
in power or feeling important, or so they say. They are happy with their
small lot in life. They do not want a lot of possessions, do not own a
car, and disdain status. But you will notice they have a need to display
this humility in a public manner. It is grandiose humility—their way to
get attention and to feel morally superior.
A variation on this is the grandiose victim—they have suffered a lot
and been the victim numerous times. Although they may like to frame
it as being simply unlucky and unfortunate, you will notice that they
often have a tendency to fall for the worst types in intimate
relationships, or put themselves in circumstances in which they are
certain to fail and suffer. In essence, they are compelled to create the
drama that will turn them into a victim. As it turns out, any
relationship with them will have to revolve around their needs; they
have suffered too much in the past to attend to your needs. They are
the center of the universe. Feeling and expressing their misfortune
gives them their sense of importance, of being superior in suffering.

[PAGE 341]
You can measure the levels of grandiosity in people in several
simple ways. For instance, notice how people respond to criticism of
them or their work. It’s normal for any of us to feel defensive and a bit
upset when criticized. But some people become enraged and hysterical,
because we have called into doubt their sense of greatness. You can be
sure that such a person has high levels of grandiosity. Similarly, such
types might conceal their rage behind a martyred, pained expression
meant to make you feel guilty. The emphasis is not on the criticism
itself and what they need to learn but on their sense of grievance.
If people are successful, notice how they act in more private
moments. Are they able to relax and laugh at themselves, letting go of
their public mask, or have they so overidentified with their powerful
public image that it carries over into their private life? In the latter
case, they have come to believe in their own myth and are in the grip of
powerful grandiosity.
Grandiose people are generally big talkers. They take credit for
anything that is even tangential to their work; they invent past
successes. They talk of their prescience, how they foresaw certain
trends or predicted certain events, none of which can be verified. All
such talk should make you doubly dubious. If people in the public eye
suddenly say something that gets them into trouble for being
insensitive, you can ascribe that to their potent grandiosity. They are
so attuned to their own great opinions that they assume everyone else
will interpret them in the right spirit and agree with them.
Higher grandiose types generally display low levels of empathy.
They are not good listeners. When the attention is not on them, they
have a faraway look in their eyes and their fingers twitch with
impatience. Only when the spotlight is on them do they become
animated. They tend to see people as extensions of themselves—tools
to be used in their schemes, sources of attention. Finally, they exhibit
nonverbal behavior that can only be described as grandiose. Their
gestures are big and dramatic. At a meeting, they take up a lot of
personal space. Their voice tends to be louder than others, and they
speak at a fast pace, giving no one else time to interrupt.
With those who exhibit moderate amounts of grandiosity, you
should be indulgent. Almost all of us alternate between periods in
which we feel superior and great and others in which we come back
down to earth. Look for such moments of realism in people as signs of

[PAGE 342]
normalcy. But with those whose self-opinion is so high they cannot
allow for any doubts, it is best to avoid relationships or entanglements.
In intimate relationships, they will tend to demand adoring one-sided
attention. If they are employees, business partners, or bosses, they will
oversell their skills. Their levels of confidence will distract you from the
deficiencies in their ideas, work habits, and character. If you cannot
avoid such a relationship, be aware of their tendency to feel certain
about the success of their ideas, and maintain your skepticism. Look at
the ideas themselves and don’t get caught up in their seductive self-
belief. Don’t entertain the illusion that you can confront them and try
to bring them down to earth; you may trigger a rage response.
If such types happen to be your rivals, consider yourself lucky. They
are easy to taunt and bait into overreactions. Casting doubts on their
greatness will make them apoplectic and doubly irrational.
Finally, you will need to manage your own grandiose tendencies.
Grandiosity has some positive and productive uses. The exuberance
and high self-belief that come from it can be channeled into your work
and help inspire you. (See “Practical Grandiosity,” on this page, for
more on this.) But in general it would be best for you to accept your
limitations and work with what you have, rather than fantasize about
godlike powers you can never attain. The greatest protection you can
have against grandiosity is to maintain a realistic attitude. You know
what subjects and activities you are naturally attracted to. You cannot
be skilled at everything. You need to play to your strengths and not
imagine you can be great at whatever you put your mind to. You must
have a thorough understanding of your energy levels, of how far you
can reasonably push yourself, and of how this changes with age. And
you must have a solid grasp on your social position—your allies, the
people with whom you have the greatest rapport, the natural audience
for your work. You cannot please everyone.
This self-awareness has a physical component to it that you must be
sensitive to. When you are doing activities that mesh with your natural
inclinations, you feel ease in the effort. You learn faster. You have more
energy and you can withstand the tedium that comes with learning
anything important. When you take on too much, more than you can
handle, you feel not only exhausted but also irritable and nervous. You
are prone to headaches. When you have success in life, you will
naturally feel a touch of fear, as if the good fortune could disappear.
You sense with this fear the dangers that can come from rising too high

[PAGE 343]
(almost like vertigo) and feeling too superior. Your anxiety is telling
you to come back down to earth. You want to listen to your body as it
signals to you when you are working against your strengths.
In knowing yourself, you accept your limits. You are simply one
person among many in the world, and not naturally superior to
anyone. You are not a god or an angel but a flawed human like the rest
of us. You accept the fact that you cannot control the people around
you and no strategy is ever foolproof. Human nature is too
unpredictable. With this self-knowledge and acceptance of limits you
will have a sense of proportion. You will search for greatness in your
work. And when you feel the pull to think more highly of yourself than
is reasonable, this self-knowledge will serve as a gravity mechanism,
pulling you back down and directing you toward the actions and
decisions that will best serve your particular nature.
Being realistic and pragmatic is what makes us humans so
powerful. It is how we overcame our physical weakness in a hostile
environment so many thousands of years ago, and learned to work
with others and form powerful communities and tools for survival.
Although we have veered away from this pragmatism, as we no longer
have to rely on our wits to survive, it is in fact our true nature as the
preeminent social animal on the planet. In becoming more realistic,
you are simply becoming more human.
The Grandiose Leader
If people with high levels of grandiosity also possess some talent and a
lot of assertive energy, they can rise to positions of great power. Their
boldness and confidence attract attention and give them a larger-than-
life presence. Mesmerized by their image, we often fail to see the
underlying irrationality in their decision-making process and so follow
them straight into some disaster. They can be very destructive.
You must realize a simple fact about these types—they depend on
the attention we give them. Without our attention, without being
adored by the public, they cannot have their high self-opinion
validated, and in such cases the very confidence they depend on
withers. To awe us and distract us from the reality, they employ certain
theatrical devices. It is imperative for us to see through their stage
tricks, to demythologize them and scale them back down to human

[PAGE 344]
size. In doing so, we can resist their allure and avoid the dangers they
represent. The following are six common illusions they like to create.
I am destined. Grandiose leaders often try to give the impression that
they were somehow destined for greatness. They tell stories of their
childhood and youth that indicate their uniqueness, as if fate had
singled them out. They highlight events that showed from early on
their unusual toughness or creativity, either making such stories up or
reinterpreting the past. They relate tales from earlier in their career in
which they overcame impossible odds. The future great leader was
already in gestation at a young age, or so they make it seem. When you
hear such things you must become skeptical. They are trying to forge a
myth, which they themselves probably have come to believe in. Look
for the more mundane facts behind the tales of destiny and, if possible,
publicize them.
I’m the common man/woman. In some cases grandiose leaders may
have risen from the lower classes, but in general they either come from
relatively privileged backgrounds or because of their success have lived
removed from the cares of everyday people for quite some time.
Nevertheless it is absolutely essential to present themselves to the
public as highly representative of the average man and woman out
there. Only through such a presentation can they attract the attention
and the adoration of large enough numbers to satisfy themselves.
Indira Gandhi, the prime minister of India from 1966 to 1977 and
1980 to 1984, came from political royalty, her father Jawaharlal Nehru
having been the first prime minister of the country. She was educated
in Europe and lived for most of her life far apart from the poorer
segments of India. But as a grandiose leader who later became quite
dictatorial, she positioned herself as one with the people, their voice
speaking through her. She altered her language when speaking in front
of large crowds and used homely metaphors when she visited small
villages. She would wear her sari as local women wore them and would
eat with her fingers. She liked to present herself as “Mother Indira,”
who ruled over India in a familiar, motherly manner. And this style she
assumed was highly effective in winning elections, even though it was
pure stagecraft.
The trick grandiose leaders play is to place the emphasis on their
cultural tastes, not on the actual class they come from. They may fly
first class and wear the most expensive suits, but they counteract this

[PAGE 345]
by seeming to have the same culinary tastes as the public, enjoy the
same movies as others, and avoid at all costs the whiff of cultural
elitism. In fact, they will go out of their way to ridicule the elites, even
though they probably depend on such experts to guide them. They are
simply just like the common folk out there, but with a lot more money
and power. The public can now identify with them despite the obvious
contradictions. But the grandiosity of this goes beyond merely gaining
more attention. These leaders become vastly enlarged by this
identification with the masses. They are not merely one man or woman
but embody an entire nation or interest group. To follow them is to be
loyal to the group itself. To criticize them is to want to crucify the
leader and betray the cause.
Even in the prosaic corporate world of business we find such
religious-style identification: Eisner, for instance, liked to present
himself as embodying the entire Disney spirit, whatever that meant. If
you notice such paradoxes and primitive forms of popular association,
stand back and analyze the reality of what is going on. You will find at
the core something quasi-mystical, highly irrational, and quite
dangerous in that the grandiose leader now feels licensed to do
whatever he or she wants in the name of the public.
I will deliver you. These types often rise to power in times of trouble
and crisis. Their self-confidence is comforting to the public or to
shareholders. They will be the ones to deliver the people from the
many problems they are facing. In order to pull this off, their promises
have to be large yet vague. By being large they can inspire dreams; by
being vague, nobody can hold the person to account if they don’t come
to pass, since there are no specifics to get hold of. The more grandiose
the promises and visions of the future, the more grandiose the faith
they will inspire. The message must be simple to digest, reducible to a
slogan, and promising something large that stirs the emotions. As part
of this strategy these types require convenient scapegoats, often the
elites or outsiders, to tighten the group identification and to stir the
emotions even further. The movement around the leader begins to
crystallize around hatred of these scapegoats, who begin to stand for
every bit of pain and injustice each person in the crowd has ever
experienced. The leader’s promise to bring these invented enemies
down increases the leader’s power exponentially.
What you will find here is that they are creating a cult more than
leading a political movement or a business. You will see that their

[PAGE 346]
name, image, and slogans must be reproduced in large numbers and
assume a godlike ubiquity. Certain colors, symbols, and perhaps music
are used to bind the group identity and appeal to the basest human
instincts. People who now believe in the cult are doubly mesmerized
and ready to excuse any kind of action. At such a point nothing will
dissuade true believers, but you must maintain your internal distance
and analytic powers.
I rewrite the rules. A secret wish of humans is to do without the usual
rules and conventions in place in any field—to gain power just by
following our own inner light. When grandiose leaders claim to have
such powers, we are secretly excited and wish to believe them.
Michael Cimino was the director of the Academy Award–winning
film The Deer Hunter (1978). To those who worked with and for him,
however, he was not simply a film director but rather a special genius
on a mission to disrupt the rigid, corporate Hollywood system. For his
next film, Heaven’s Gate (1980), he negotiated a contract that was
completely unique in Hollywood history, one that allowed him to
increase the budget as he saw fit and to create precisely the film he had
envisioned, with no strings attached. On the set, Cimino spent weeks
rehearsing the actors in the right kind of roller-skating he needed for
one scene. One day he waited hours before rolling cameras, just so the
perfect kind of cloud could pass into frame. The costs soared and the
film he initially turned in was over five hours long. In the end,
Heaven’s Gate was one of the greatest disasters in Hollywood history,
and it virtually destroyed Cimino’s career. It seemed that the
traditional contract had actually served a purpose—to rein in the
natural grandiosity of any film director and make him or her work
within limits. Most rules do have common sense and rationality behind
them.
As a variation on this, grandiose leaders will often rely on their
intuitions, disregarding the need for focus groups or any form of
scientific feedback. They have a special inside connection to the truth.
They like to create the myth that their hunches have led to fantastic
successes, but close scrutiny will reveal that their hunches miss as
often as they hit. When you hear leaders present themselves as the
consummate maverick, able to do away with rules and science, you
must see this only as a sign of madness, not divine inspiration.

[PAGE 347]
I have the golden touch. Those with heightened grandiosity will try to
create the legend that they have never really failed. If there were
failures or setbacks in their career, it was always the fault of others
who betrayed them. U.S. Army general Douglas MacArthur was a
genius at deflecting blame; to hear him say it, in his long career he had
never lost a battle, although in fact he had lost many. But by
trumpeting his successes and finding endless excuses, such as
betrayals, for his losses, he created the myth of his magical battlefield
powers. Grandiose leaders inevitably resort to such marketing magic.
Related to this is the belief that they can easily transfer their skills—
a movie executive can become a theme park designer, a businessman
can become the leader of a nation. Because they are magically gifted,
they can try their hand at anything that attracts them. This is often a
fatal move on their part, as they attempt things beyond their expertise
and quickly become overwhelmed with the complexity and chaos that
come from their lack of experience. In dealing with such types, look
carefully at their record and notice how many glaring failures they
have had. Although people under the influence of their grandiosity will
probably not listen, publicize the truth of their record in as neutral a
manner as possible.
I’m invulnerable. The grandiose leader takes risks. This is what often
attracts attention in the first place, and combined with the success that
often attends the bold, they seem larger than life. But this boldness is
not really under control. They must take actions that create a splash in
order to keep the attention coming that feeds their high self-opinion.
They cannot rest or retreat, because that would cause a lapse in
publicity. To make things worse, they come to feel invulnerable
because so many times in the past they have gotten away with risky
maneuvers, and if they faced setbacks, they managed to overcome
them through more audacity. Furthermore, these daring activities
make them feel alive and on edge. It becomes a drug. They need bigger
stakes and rewards to maintain the feeling of godlike invulnerability.
They can work twenty hours a day when under this form of pressure.
They can walk through fire.
In fact they are rather invulnerable, until that fatal hubristic
maneuver in which they finally go too far and it all crashes down. This
could be MacArthur’s grandiose tour of the United States after the
Korean War, in which his irrational need for attention became
painfully apparent; or Mao’s fatal decision to unleash the Cultural

[PAGE 348]
Revolution; or Stan O’Neal, CEO of Merrill Lynch, sticking with
mortgage-backed securities when everyone else was getting out,
essentially destroying one of the oldest financial institutions in the
country. Suddenly the aura of being invulnerable is shattered. This
occurs because their decisions are determined not by rational
considerations but by the need for attention and glory, and eventually
reality catches up, in one hard blow.
In general, in dealing with the grandiose leader, you want to try to
deflate the sacred, glorious image they have forged. They will overreact
and their followers will become rabid, but slowly a few followers may
have second thoughts. Creating a viral disenchantment is your best
hope.
Practical Grandiosity
Grandiosity is a form of primal energy we all possess. It impels us to
want something more than we have, to be recognized and esteemed by
others, and to feel connected to something larger. The problem is not
with the energy itself, which can be used to fuel our ambitions, but
with the direction it takes. Normally grandiosity makes us imagine we
are greater and more superior than is actually the case. We can call this
fantastical grandiosity because it is based on our fantasies and the
skewed impression we get from any attention we receive. The other
form, which we shall call practical grandiosity, is not easy to achieve
and does not come naturally to us, but it can be the source of
tremendous power and self-fulfillment.
Practical grandiosity is based not on fantasy but on reality. The
energy is channeled into our work and our desire to reach goals, to
solve problems, or to improve relationships. It impels us to develop
and hone our skills. Through our accomplishments we can feel greater.
We attract attention through our work. The attention we receive in this
way is gratifying and keeps us energized, but the greater sense of
gratification comes from the work itself and from overcoming our own
weaknesses. The desire for attention is under control and subordinate.
Our self-esteem is raised, but it is tied to real achievements, not to
nebulous, subjective fantasies. We feel our presence enlarged through
our work, through what we contribute to society.

[PAGE 349]
Although the precise way to channel the energy will depend on your
field and skill level, the following are five basic principles that are
essential for attaining the high level of fulfillment that can come from
this reality-based form of grandiosity.
Come to terms with your grandiose needs. You need to begin from a
position of honesty. You must admit to yourself that you do want to
feel important and be the center of attention. This is natural. Yes, you
want to feel superior. You have ambitions like everyone else. In the
past, your grandiose needs may have led you into some bad decisions,
which you can now acknowledge and analyze. Denial is your worst
enemy. Only with this self-awareness can you begin to transform the
energy into something practical and productive.
Concentrate the energy. Fantastical grandiosity will make you flit from
one fantastic idea to another, imagining all the accolades and attention
you’ll receive but never realizing any of them. You must do the
opposite. You want to get into the habit of focusing deeply and
completely on a single project or problem. You want the goal to be
relatively simple to reach, and within a time frame of months and not
years. You will want to break this down into mini steps and goals along
the way. Your objective here is to enter a state of flow, in which your
mind becomes increasingly absorbed in the work, to the point at which
ideas come to you at odd hours. This feeling of flow should be
pleasurable and addicting. You don’t allow yourself to engage in
fantasies about other projects on the horizon. You want to absorb
yourself in the work as deeply as possible. If you do not enter this state
of flow, you are inevitably multitasking and stopping the focus. Work
on overcoming this.
This could be a project you work on outside your job. It is not the
number of hours you put in but the intensity and consistent effort you
bring to it.
Related to this, you want this project to involve skills you already
have or are in the process of developing. Your goal is to see continual
improvement in your skill level, which will certainly come from the
depth of your focus. Your confidence will rise. That should be enough
to keep you advancing.
Maintain a dialogue with reality. Your project begins with an idea, and
as you try to hone this idea, you let your imagination take flight, being
open to various possibilities. At some point you move from the

[PAGE 350]
planning phase to execution. Now you must actively search for
feedback and criticism from people you respect or from your natural
audience. You want to hear about the flaws and inadequacies in your
plan, for that is the only way to improve your skills. If the project fails
to have the results you imagined, or the problem is not solved, embrace
this as the best way to learn. Analyze what you did wrong in depth,
being as brutal as possible.
Once you have feedback and have analyzed the results, you then
return to this project or start a new one, letting your imagination loose
again but incorporating what you have learned from the experience.
You keep cycling endlessly through this process, noticing with
excitement how you are improving by doing so. If you stay too long in
the imagination phase, what you create will tend to be grandiose and
detached from reality. If you only listen to feedback and try to make
the work a complete reflection of what others tell you or want, the
work will be conventional and flat. By maintaining a continual
dialogue between reality (feedback) and your imagination, you will
create something practical and powerful.
If you have any success with your projects, that is when you must
step back from the attention you are receiving. Look at the role that
luck may have played, or the help you received from others. Resist
falling for the success delusion. As you now focus on the next idea, see
yourself back at square one. Each new project represents a new
challenge and a fresh approach. You might very well fail. You need the
same level of focus as you had on the last project. Never rest on your
laurels or let up in your intensity.
Seek out calibrated challenges. The problem with fantastical grandiosity
is that you imagine some great new goal you will achieve—that brilliant
novel you will write, that lucrative start-up you will create. The
challenge is so great that you may start, but you will soon peter out as
you realize you are not up to it. Or if you are the ambitious, assertive
type, you might try to go all the way, but you will end up in the Euro
Disney syndrome, overwhelmed, failing in a large fashion, blaming
others for the fiasco, and never learning from the experience.
Your goal with practical grandiosity is to continually look for
challenges just above your skill level. If the projects you attempt are
below or at your skill level, you will become easily bored and less
focused. If they are too ambitious, you will feel crushed by your failure.

[PAGE 351]
However, if they are calibrated to be more challenging than the last
project, but to a moderate degree, you will find yourself excited and
energized. You must be up to this challenge so your focus levels will
rise as well. This is the optimum path toward learning. If you fail, you
will not feel overwhelmed and you will learn even more. If you succeed,
your confidence increases, but it is tied to your work and to having met
the challenge. Your sense of accomplishment will satisfy your need for
greatness.
Let loose your grandiose energy. Once you have tamed this energy,
made it serve your ambitions and goals, you should feel safe to let it
loose upon occasion. Think of it as a wild animal that needs to roam
free now and then or it will go mad from restlessness. What this means
is that you occasionally allow yourself to entertain ideas or projects
that represent greater challenges than you have considered in the past.
You feel increasingly confident and you want to test yourself. Consider
developing a new skill in an unrelated field, or writing that novel you
once considered a distraction from the real work. Or simply give freer
rein to your imagination when in the planning process.
If you are in the public eye and must perform before others, let go of
the restraint you have developed and let your grandiose energy fill you
with high levels of self-belief. This will animate your gestures and give
you greater charisma. If you are a leader and your group is facing
difficulties or a crisis, let yourself feel unusually grandiose and
confident in the success of your mission, to lift up and inspire the
troops. That was the kind of grandiosity that made Winston Churchill
such an effective leader during World War II.
In any event, you can allow yourself to feel ever so godlike because
you have come so far with your improved skills and actual
achievements. If you have taken the time to properly work through the
other principles, you will naturally return back down to earth after a
few days or hours of grandiose exuberance.
—
Finally, at the source of our infantile grandiosity was a feeling of
intense connection to the mother. This was so complete and satisfying
that we spend much of our time trying to recapture that feeling in
some way. It is the source of our desire to transcend our banal

[PAGE 352]
existence, to want something so large we cannot express what it is. We
have glimmers of that original connection in intimate relationships
and in moments of unconditional love, but these are rare and fleeting.
Entering a state of flow with our work or cultivating deeper levels of
empathy with people (see chapter 2) will give us more such moments
and satisfy the urge. We feel oneness with the work or with other
people. We can take this even further by experiencing a deeper
connection to life itself, what Sigmund Freud called “the oceanic
feeling.”
Consider this in the following way: The formation of life itself on the
planet Earth so many billions of years ago required a concatenation of
events that were highly improbable. The beginning of life was a
tenuous experiment that could have expired at any moment early on.
The evolution since then of so many forms of life is astounding, and at
the end point of that evolution is the only animal we know to be
conscious of this entire process, the human.
Your being alive is an equally unlikely and uncanny event. It
required a very particular chain of events leading to the meeting of
your parents and your birth, all of which could have gone very
differently. At this moment, as you read this, you are conscious of life
along with billions of others, and only for a brief time, until you die.
Fully taking in this reality is what we shall call the Sublime. (For more
on this, see
