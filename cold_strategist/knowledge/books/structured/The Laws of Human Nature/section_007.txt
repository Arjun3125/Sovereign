Related to this, you must learn to balance presence and absence. If
you are too present and familiar, always available and visible, you
seem too banal. You give people no room to idealize you. But if you are
too aloof, people cannot identify with you. In general, it is best to lean
slightly more in the direction of absence, so that when you do appear
before the group, you generate excitement and drama. If done right, in
those moments when you are not available, people will be thinking of
you. Today people have lost this art. They are far too present and
familiar, their every move displayed on social media. That might make
you relatable, but it also makes you seem just like everyone else, and it
is impossible to project authority with such an ordinary presence.
Keep in mind that talking too much is a type of overpresence that
grates and reveals weakness. Silence is a form of absence and
withdrawal that draws attention; it spells self-control and power; when
you do talk, it has a greater effect. In a similar fashion, if you commit a
mistake, do not overexplain and overapologize. You make it clear you

[PAGE 514]
accept responsibility and are accountable for any failures, and then you
move on. Your contrition should be relatively quiet; your subsequent
actions will show you have learned the lesson. Avoid appearing
defensive and whiny if attacked. You are above that.
Develop this aura early on, as a way to enthrall people. Do not make
the mix too strong, or you will seem insane. It is an undertone that
makes people wonder in a good way. It is a matter not of faking
qualities you do not have, but rather of bringing out more of your
natural complexity.
Never appear to take, always to give: the Taboo. Taking something from
people they have assumed they possessed—money, rights or privileges,
time that is their own—creates a basic insecurity and will call into
question your authority and all the credit you have amassed. You make
the members of the group feel uncertain about the future in a most
visceral manner. You stir up doubts about your legitimacy as a leader:
“What more will you take? Are you abusing the power that you have?
Have you been fooling us all along?” Even the hint of this will harm
your reputation. If sacrifices are necessary, you are the first to make
them, and they are not simply symbolic. Try to frame any loss of
resources or privileges as temporary, and make it clear how quickly
you will restore them. Follow the path of Queen Elizabeth I and make
the husbanding of resources your primary concern, so that you never
end up in this position. Make it so that you can afford to be generous.
Related to this, you must avoid overpromising to people. In the
moment, it might feel good to let them hear of the great things you will
do for them, but people generally have an acute memory for promises,
and if you fail to deliver, it will stick in their mind, even if you try to
blame others or circumstances. If this happens a second time, your
authority begins to sharply erode. Not giving what you promised to
deliver will feel like something you have taken away. Everyone can talk
a good game and promise, and so you seem like just anyone else we
encounter, and the disappointment can be profound.
Rejuvenate your authority: Adaptability. Your authority will grow with
each action that inspires trust and respect. It gives you the luxury to
remain in power long enough to realize great projects. But as you get
older, the authority you established can become rigid and stodgy. You
become the father figure who starts to seem oppressive by how long he
has monopolized power, no matter how deeply people admired him in

[PAGE 515]
the past. A new generation inevitably emerges that is immune to your
charm, to the aura you have created. They see you as a relic. You also
have the tendency as you get older to become ever so slightly intolerant
and tyrannical, as you cannot help but expect people to follow you.
Without being aware, you start to feel entitled, and people sense this.
Besides, the public wants newness and fresh faces.
The first step in avoiding this danger is to maintain the kind of
sensitivity that Elizabeth displayed throughout her life, noting the
moods behind people’s words, gauging the effect you have on
newcomers and young people. Losing that empathy should be your
greatest fear, as you will begin to cocoon yourself in your great
reputation.
The second step is to look for new markets and audiences to appeal
to, which will force you to adapt. If possible, expand the reach of your
authority. Without making a fool of yourself by attempting to appeal to
a younger crowd that you cannot really understand, try to alter your
style somewhat with the passing years. In the arts, this has been the
secret to success of people like Pablo Picasso, or Alfred Hitchcock, or
Coco Chanel. Such flexibility in those who are in their fifties and
beyond will give you a touch of the divine and immortal—your spirit
remains alive and open, and your authority is renewed.
The Inner Authority
We all have a higher and a lower self. At certain moments in life, we
can definitely feel one part or the other as the stronger. When we
accomplish things, when we finish what we start, we can sense the
outlines of this higher self. We feel it as well when we think of others
before ourselves, when we let go of our ego, when instead of merely
reacting to events, we step back and think and strategize the best way
forward. But equally we know all too well the stirrings of the lower self,
when we take everything personally and become petty, or when we
want to escape reality through some addictive pleasure, or when we
waste time, or when we feel confused and unmotivated.
Although we most often float between these two sides, if we look at
ourselves closely, we have to admit that the lower half is the stronger
one. It is the more primitive and animal part of our nature. If nothing
impels us to do otherwise, we naturally become indolent, crave quick

[PAGE 516]
pleasures, turn inward, and brood over petty matters. It often takes
great effort and awareness to tame this lower half and bring out the
higher side; it is not our first impulse.
The key to making the struggle between the two sides more even
and to perhaps tip the scales toward the higher is to cultivate what we
shall call the inner authority. It serves as the voice, the conscience of
our higher self. This voice is already there; we hear it at times, but it is
weak. We need to increase the frequency with which we hear it and its
volume. Think of this voice as dictating a code of behavior, and every
day we must make ourselves listen to it. It tells us the following.
You have a responsibility to contribute to the culture and times you live in.
Right now, you are living off the fruits of millions of people in the past
who have made your life incomparably easier through their struggles
and inventions. You have benefited from an education that embodies
the wisdom of thousands of years of experience. It is so easy to take
this all for granted, to imagine that it all just came about naturally and
that you are entitled to have all of these powers. That is the view of
spoiled children, and you must see any signs of such an attitude within
you as shameful. This world needs constant improvement and renewal.
You are here not merely to gratify your impulses and consume what
others have made but to make and contribute as well, to serve a higher
purpose.
To serve this higher purpose, you must cultivate what is unique about you.
Stop listening so much to the words and opinions of others, telling you
who you are and what you should like and dislike. Judge things and
people for yourself. Question what you think and why you feel a certain
way. Know yourself thoroughly—your innate tastes and inclinations,
the fields that naturally attract you. Work every day on improving
those skills that mesh with your unique spirit and purpose. Add to the
needed diversity of culture by creating something that reflects your
uniqueness. Embrace what makes you different. Not following this
course is the real reason you feel depressed at times. Moments of
depression are a call to listen again to your inner authority.
In a world full of endless distractions, you must focus and prioritize. Certain
activities are a waste of time. Certain people of a low nature will drag
you down, and you must avoid them. Keep your eye on your long- and
short-term goals, and remain concentrated and alert. Allow yourself
the luxury of exploring and wandering creatively, but always with an
underlying purpose.

[PAGE 517]
You must adhere to the highest standards in your work. You strive for
excellence, to make something that will resonate with the public and
last. To fall short of this is to disappoint people and to let down your
audience, and that makes you feel ashamed. To maintain such
standards, you must develop self-discipline and the proper work
habits. You must pay great attention to the details in your work and
place a premium value on effort. The first thought or idea that comes
to you is most often incomplete and inadequate. Think more
thoroughly and deeply about your ideas, some of which you must
discard. Do not become attached to your initial ideas, but rather treat
them roughly. Keep in mind that your life is short, that it could end any
day. You must have a sense of urgency to make the most of this limited
time. You don’t need deadlines or people telling you what to do and
when to finish. Any motivation you need comes from within. You are
complete and self-reliant.
When it comes to operating with this inner authority, we can
consider Leonardo da Vinci our model. His motto in life was ostinato
rigore, “relentless rigor.” Whenever Leonardo was given a
commission, he went well beyond the task, poring over every detail to
make the work more lifelike or effective. No one had to tell him to do
this. He was ferociously diligent and hard on himself. Although his
interests ranged far and wide, when he attacked a particular problem,
it was with complete focus. He had a sense of a personal mission—to
serve mankind, to contribute toward its progress. Impelled by this
inner authority, he pushed beyond all of the limits that he had
inherited—being an illegitimate son with little direction or education
early on in his life. Such a voice will likewise help us push beyond the
obstacles that life places in our path.
It might seem at first glance that having such a voice from within
could lead to a rather harsh and unpleasant life, but in fact it is the
opposite. There is nothing more disorienting and depressing than to
see the years pass by without a sense of direction, grasping to reach
goals that keep changing, and squandering our youthful energies.
Much as the outer authority helps keep the group unified, its energy
channeled toward productive and higher ends, the inner authority
brings you a sense of cohesion and force. You are not gnawed by the
anxiety that comes with living below your potential.
Feeling the higher self in ascendance, you can afford to indulge that
lower self, to let it out at moments to release tension and not become a

[PAGE 518]
prisoner of your Shadow. And most important, you no longer need the
comfort and guidance of a parent or leader. You have become your own
mother and father, your own leader, truly independent and operating
according to your inner authority.
The select man, the excellent man is urged, by interior necessity, to appeal
from himself to some standard beyond himself, superior to himself, whose
service he freely accepts. . . . We distinguished the excellent man from the
common man by saying that the former is one who makes great demands
on himself, and the latter the one who makes no demands on himself, but
contents himself with what he is, and is delighted with himself. Contrary to
what is usually thought, it is the man of excellence . . . who lives in essential
servitude. Life has no savor for him unless he makes it consist in service to
something transcendental. Hence he does not look upon the necessity of
serving as an oppression. When, by chance, such necessity is lacking, he
grows restless and invents some new standard, more difficult, more exigent,
with which to coerce himself. This is life lived as a discipline—the noble life.
—José Ortega y Gasset

See the Hostility Behind the
Friendly Façade
The Law of Aggression
On the surface, the people around you appear so polite and
civilized. But beneath the mask, they are all inevitably dealing
with frustrations. They have a need to influence people and gain
power over circumstances. Feeling blocked in their endeavors, they
often try to assert themselves in manipulative ways that catch you by
surprise. And then there are those whose need for power and
impatience to obtain it are greater than others. They turn
particularly aggressive, getting their way by intimidating people,
being relentless and willing to do almost anything. You must
transform yourself into a superior observer of people’s unsatisfied
aggressive desires, paying extra attention to the chronic aggressors
and passive aggressors in our midst. You must recognize the signs—
the past patterns of behavior, the obsessive need to control everything
in their environment—that indicate the dangerous types. They depend
on making you emotional—afraid, angry—and unable to think
straight. Do not give them this power. When it comes to your own
aggressive energy, learn to tame and channel it for productive
purposes—standing up for yourself, attacking problems with
relentless energy, realizing great ambitions.
The Sophisticated Aggressor
In late 1857, Maurice B. Clark, a twenty-eight-year-old Englishman
living in Cleveland, Ohio, made the most important decision yet in his
young life: he would quit his comfortable job as a high-level buyer and
seller for a produce firm and start his own business in the same line.

[PAGE 520]
He had the ambition of becoming yet another new millionaire in this
bustling city, and he had nothing but confidence in his powers to get
there: he was a born hustler with a nose for making money.
Clark had fled England some ten years earlier, fearing imminent
arrest for having struck his employer and knocked him unconscious.
(He always had a bit of a temper.) He had emigrated to the United
States, traveled west from New York, landed all kinds of odd jobs, and
then ended up in Cleveland, where he quickly rose through the ranks of
merchants. Cleveland was something of a boomtown, located on a river
and Lake Erie and serving as a key transportation hub connecting the
East to the West. There would never be a better time for Clark to push
his way forward and make a fortune.
There was only one problem—he did not have enough money to
start the business. He would need a collaborator with some capital,
and as he thought about this, he came up with a possible business
partner, a young man named John D. Rockefeller whom Clark had
befriended at a commercial college both had attended a few years
before.
At first glance, it seemed an odd choice. Rockefeller was only
eighteen years old. He was working as a bookkeeper at a fairly large
produce-shipping firm named Hewitt and Tuttle, and he was in so
many ways the polar opposite of Clark: Clark loved to live well, with a
taste for fine things, gambling, and the ladies; he was feisty and
combative. Rockefeller was fiercely religious, unusually sober and
mild-mannered for his age. How could they possibly get along? And
Clark had calculated that his partner would have to put up at least
$2,000 to get the company under way. How would a bookkeeper from
a family of limited means have such savings? On the other hand, in his
two years at Hewitt and Tuttle, Rockefeller had earned a reputation as
one of the most fiercely efficient and honest clerks in town, a man who
could be relied upon to account for every penny spent and keep the
company in the black. More important, as Rockefeller was so young,
Clark could dominate the relationship. It was worth asking him.
To Clark’s surprise, when he suggested the partnership, Rockefeller
not only jumped at the opportunity with uncharacteristic zeal but
quickly came up with the $2,000, somehow borrowing the funds.
Rockefeller quit his job and the new company, called Clark and
Rockefeller, opened for business in April 1858.

[PAGE 521]
In its first years Clark and Rockefeller was a thriving enterprise. The
two men balanced each other out, and there was much business to be
had in Cleveland. But as time went on, Clark began to feel increasingly
irritated by the young man, and even a bit contemptuous of him. He
was more straitlaced than Clark had imagined; he had no discernible
vices. His main pleasure seemed to come from the accounting books
that he kept so well and finding ways to save money. Although still so
young, he already had a slumped posture from poring over his ledgers
day and night. He dressed like a middle-aged banker, and acted that
way as well. Clark’s brother James, who worked in the office, dubbed
him “the Sunday-school superintendent.”
Slowly Clark began to see Rockefeller as too dull and dreary to be
one of the faces of the company. Clark brought in a new partner from
an elite Cleveland family and dropped Rockefeller’s name from the
company title, hoping that would draw even more business.
Surprisingly, Rockefeller did not seem to object to this; he was all in
favor of making more money and cared little about titles.
Their produce business was booming, but soon word spread
through Cleveland of a new commodity that could spark the region’s
equivalent of a gold rush—the recent discovery of rich veins of oil in
nearby western Pennsylvania. In 1862 a young Englishman named
Samuel Andrews—an inventor/entrepreneur who had known Clark in
England—visited their offices and pleaded with Clark to become
partners in the oil business. He bragged of the limitless potential in oil
—the lucrative series of products that could be made out of the
material and the cheapness of producing them. With just a little capital
they could start their own refinery and make a fortune.
Clark’s response was lukewarm—it was a business that experienced
tremendous ups and downs, prices continually rising and falling, and
with the Civil War now raging, it seemed a bad time to commit so fully.
It would be better to get involved on some lower level. But then
Andrews gave his pitch to Rockefeller, and something seemed to spark
to life in the young man’s eyes. Rockefeller convinced Clark that they
should fund the refinery—he would personally ensure its success. Clark
had never seen Rockefeller so enthusiastic about anything. It must
mean something, he thought, and so he relented to the pressure from
the two men. In 1863 they formed a new refining business called
Andrews, Clark and Company.

[PAGE 522]
That same year, twenty other refineries sprouted up in Cleveland,
and the competition was fierce. To Clark, it was quite amusing to watch
Rockefeller in action. He spent hours in the refinery, sweeping the
floors, polishing the metal, rolling out barrels, stacking hoops. It was
like a love affair. He worked well into the night trying to figure out
ways to streamline the refinery and squeeze more money out of it. It
had become the principal generator of profit for their firm, and Clark
could not help but be pleased that he had agreed to fund it. Oil,
however, had become Rockefeller’s obsession, and he constantly
bombarded Clark with new ideas for expansion, all at a time when the
price of oil was fluctuating more than ever. Clark told him to go more
slowly; he found the chaos in the oil business unnerving.
Increasingly, Clark found it hard to hide his irritation: Rockefeller
was getting a bit puffed up with the success of the refinery. Clark had
to remind the former bookkeeper of whose idea it had been all along to
start their business. Like a refrain, he kept telling Rockefeller, “What in
the world would you have done without me?” Then he discovered that
Rockefeller had borrowed $100,000 for the refinery without
consulting him, and he angrily ordered Rockefeller to never go behind
his back again and to stop looking to expand the business. But nothing
he said or did seemed to stop him. For someone so quiet and
unassuming, Rockefeller could be annoyingly relentless, like a child. A
few months after Clark had berated him, Rockefeller hit him with
another request to sign for a big loan, and Clark finally exploded: “If
that’s the way you want to do business, we’d better dissolve, and let
you run your own affairs to suit yourself.”
Clark had no desire to break up the partnership at this point—it was
too profitable, and despite the qualities that grated on his nerves, he
needed Rockefeller as the man to look after the dull details of their
growing enterprise. He simply wanted to intimidate Rockefeller with
this threat, which seemed to be the only way to get him to back off on
his tireless quest to quickly grow the refinery business. As usual,
Rockefeller said little and seemed to defer.
Then, the following month, Rockefeller invited Clark and Andrews
to his house to discuss future plans. And despite all of Clark’s previous
admonitions, Rockefeller outlined even bolder ideas for expanding the
refinery, and once again Clark could not control himself. “We’d better
split up!” he yelled. Then something odd happened—Rockefeller
agreed to this and got Clark and Andrews to affirm that they were all in

[PAGE 523]
favor of dissolving the partnership. He did this without the slightest
trace of anger or resentment.
Clark had played a lot of poker, and he felt certain Rockefeller was
bluffing, trying to force his hand. If he refused to budge on the young
man’s desire to expand the business, Rockefeller would have to back
down. He could not afford to be on his own; he needed Clark more
than the other way around. He would be forced to realize his rashness
and ask to resume the partnership. In doing so, Rockefeller would be
humbled. Clark could set the terms and demand that Rockefeller
follow his lead.
To his amazement, however, the next day Clark read in the local
newspaper the announcement of the dissolution of their business, the
notice obviously placed there by Rockefeller himself. When Clark
confronted him later that day, Rockefeller calmly replied he was
merely putting into action what they had agreed upon the day before,
that it had been Clark’s idea to start with, and that he thought Clark
was right. He suggested they hold an auction and sell the company to
the highest bidder. Something about his dull, businesslike manner was
infuriating. At this point, agreeing to the auction was not the worst
option. Clark would outbid him and be rid of this insufferable upstart
once and for all.
On the day of the auction in February 1865, Clark used a lawyer to
represent his side, while Rockefeller represented himself, yet another
sign of his arrogance and lack of sophistication. The price kept ticking
upward, and finally Rockefeller bid $72,500, a rather ridiculous and
shocking price to pay, a sum that Clark could not possibly afford. How
would Rockefeller have so much money, and how could he possibly run
this business without Clark? He clearly had lost any business sense
that he had had. If that was what he was willing to pay, and he had the
funds, let him have it and good riddance. As part of the sale,
Rockefeller got the refinery but had to let go of the produce business
with no compensation. Clark was more than satisfied, although it
bothered him that Andrews had decided to go along with Rockefeller
and remain his partner.
In the months to come, however, Maurice Clark began to reassess
what had happened: he started to have the uneasy feeling that
Rockefeller had been planning this for months, perhaps more than a
year. Rockefeller must have courted bankers and secured bank loans

[PAGE 524]
well before the auction, to be able to afford the high price. He must
have also secured Andrews to his side in advance. He could detect a
gloating look in Rockefeller’s eye the day the refinery became his,
something he had never seen before in the sober young man. Was that
quiet and dull appearance of his merely an act? As the years revealed
the immense wealth Rockefeller would accumulate through this first
move, Clark could not help but entertain the thought he had somehow
been played.
—
Colonel Oliver H. Payne was the equivalent of Cleveland aristocracy.
He came from an illustrious family that included one of the founders of
the city itself. He had attended Yale University and had become a
decorated Civil War hero. And after the war he had started several
successful business enterprises. He had one of the finest mansions in
town on Euclid Avenue, nicknamed Millionaire’s Row. But he had
larger ambitions, perhaps politics; he thought of himself as
presidential material.
One of his thriving businesses was a refinery, which was the second
biggest in town. But toward the end of 1871, Payne began to hear
strange rumors of some kind of agreement between a few refinery
owners and the largest railroads: the railroads would lower their rates
for the particular refineries that had joined this secret organization, in
exchange for a guaranteed volume of traffic. Those outside this
organization would find their rates rising, making business difficult if
not impossible. And the chief refinery owner, and the only one in
Cleveland, behind this agreement was apparently none other than
John D. Rockefeller.
Rockefeller had expanded to two refineries in Cleveland and had
renamed the company Standard Oil. Standard Oil was now the
country’s largest refining business, but the competition remained stiff,
even within Cleveland and its now twenty-eight refineries, including
those of Standard Oil. Because of this booming business, more and
more millionaires had built their mansions on Euclid Avenue. But if
Rockefeller controlled entrée into this new organization, he could do
great damage to his competitors. It was in the midst of these rumors

[PAGE 525]
that Rockefeller arranged for a very private meeting between him and
Payne at a Cleveland bank.
Payne knew Rockefeller well. They had been born two weeks apart,
had gone to the same high school, and lived near each other on Euclid
Avenue. He admired Rockefeller’s business savvy but also feared him.
Rockefeller was the kind of man who could not stand to lose in
anything. If someone passed him by in a horse-drawn carriage,
Rockefeller would have to whip his horses and overtake it. They
worshipped in the same church; Payne knew he was a man of high
principle, but he was also quite mysterious and secretive.
In their meeting, Rockefeller confided in Payne: he was the first
outsider to be told of the existence of this secret organization, to be
called the Southern Improvement Company (SIC). Rockefeller claimed
it was the railroads that had come up with the idea of the SIC to
increase their profits, and that he had really had no choice but to enter
into the agreement. He did not invite Payne to join the SIC. Instead he
offered to buy out Payne’s refinery at a very nice price, to give Payne a
hefty amount of Standard Oil stock that would certainly mint him a
fortune, and to bring him in as a high-level executive with an
illustrious title. He would make far more money this way than by
trying to compete with Standard Oil.
Rockefeller said all of this in the politest tone. He was going to keep
expanding and bring some much-needed order to the anarchic oil
industry. It was a crusade of his, and he was inviting Payne to be a
fellow crusader from within Standard Oil. It was a compelling way to
present his case, but Payne hesitated. He had moments of exasperation
in dealing with this unpredictable business, but he had not thought of
selling the refinery. It was all so sudden. Sensing his indecision,
Rockefeller gave him a look of great sympathy and offered Payne the
chance to examine Standard Oil’s ledgers, to convince him of the
futility of resistance. Payne could hardly turn that down, and what he
saw in a few short hours astounded him: Standard Oil had
considerably higher profit margins than his own. Nobody had
suspected to what extent Standard Oil was outpacing its rivals. For
Payne, it was enough, and he accepted Rockefeller’s offer.
News of the sale of Payne’s refinery, as well as the growing rumors
of the existence of the SIC, completely rattled the other refinery owners

[PAGE 526]
in town. With Payne’s refinery in his pocket, Rockefeller was in a very
strong position.
Within weeks, J. W. Fawcett of Fawcett and Critchley, another
major refinery in town, received a visit from Rockefeller. His pitch was
ever so slightly more ominous than what he had delivered to Payne:
the business was too unpredictable; Cleveland was farther away from
the oil-producing towns, and the refiners had to pay more for crude oil
to be shipped there; they were at a continual disadvantage; with the
prices of oil continuing to fluctuate, many of them would go bust;
Rockefeller was going to consolidate them and give Cleveland some
leverage with the railroads; he was doing them all a favor, relieving
them of the tremendous burdens of the business and giving them
money before they went broke, which with the SIC was certain to
happen.
The price he offered for Fawcett’s refinery was certainly less
generous than what he had paid Payne, as were the shares and the
position within Standard Oil that went along with the proposition, and
Fawcett was quite reluctant to sell, but a glance at Standard Oil’s books
overwhelmed him, and he surrendered to Rockefeller’s terms.
Now more and more refinery owners received a visit from
Rockefeller, and one after another succumbed to the pressure, since
holding out put them in a weaker negotiating position, as the price
Rockefeller offered for their refineries kept getting lower. One holdout
owner was Isaac Hewitt, Rockefeller’s former boss when he was a
fledgling bookkeeper. Selling the refinery at such a low price could ruin
Hewitt. He begged Rockefeller for mercy and to be left alone with his
business. Rockefeller, ever gentle and polite, told him that he could not
possibly compete with Standard Oil moving forward. “I have ways of
making money you know nothing about,” he explained. Hewitt sold his
refinery for more than half the price he had wanted.
By the middle of March, the existence of the SIC had become public
and the pressure had mounted for such an organization to be
disbanded or suffer legal consequences. The railroads relented, and so
did Rockefeller, who did not seem all that upset at this news. The
matter was settled, the SIC disappeared, but in the months to come
some people in Cleveland began to wonder if all was not what it had
appeared to be. The SIC had never really taken effect; it had remained
just a rumor, and Standard Oil, it seemed, was the principal source of

[PAGE 527]
that rumor. In the meantime, Rockefeller had effected what had
become known as the Cleveland Massacre—in just a few months, he
had bought out twenty of the twenty-six refineries outside his control.
Many elegant mansions of former millionaires on Euclid Avenue were
now being sold or boarded up, as Rockefeller had carefully knocked
them out of the business. He had acted as if the railroads were calling
all the shots with the SIC, but perhaps it had been the other way
around.
—
In the years to come, those in the railroad business began to greatly
fear the growing power of Standard Oil. After the Cleveland Massacre,
Rockefeller applied the same tactics to refineries in Pittsburgh,
Philadelphia, and New York. His method was always the same: aiming
first for the biggest refineries in the respective town, showing them his
books, which were now even more impressive, getting a few big fish to
surrender, and instilling panic in the others. Those who held out he
would ruthlessly undersell and drive out of the market. By 1875,
Rockefeller controlled all of the major refining centers in the United
States and virtually monopolized the worldwide market for kerosene,
the principal product used for lighting.
Such power gave him far too much leverage over railroad rates, but
to make matters worse, Rockefeller had begun to dominate the
pipeline business, the other way of transporting oil. He built up a
whole series of pipelines throughout Pennsylvania and had gained
control of several railroads that helped ship the oil the rest of the way
to the East Coast, giving him his own transportation networks. If he
continued unimpeded in this campaign, his position would be
impregnable. And nobody was more afraid of this prospect than Tom
Scott, president of the Pennsylvania Railroad, at the time the largest
and most powerful corporation in America.
Scott had led a most distinguished life. During the Civil War, he had
served as Lincoln’s assistant secretary of war, in charge of ensuring the
smooth functioning of the railroads in aiding the North’s effort. As
head of the Pennsylvania Railroad, he had ambitions of endlessly
expanding the company’s reach, but Rockefeller stood in the way, and
it was time to do battle with Standard Oil.

[PAGE 528]
Scott had all the necessary resources to take on Rockefeller, and he
had a plan. For the past few years, anticipating Rockefeller’s
maneuvers, he had built up his own enormous network of pipelines
that would work in conjunction with his railroad to move oil to
refineries. He would ramp up the construction of new pipelines and
purchase new refineries that sprang up, creating his own rival network,
ensuring his railroad enough business to check Rockefeller’s progress,
then work to weaken him further. But as it became clear what he was
up to, Rockefeller’s response was totally unexpected and rather
shocking: Standard Oil shut down almost all its Pennsylvania
refineries, giving Scott’s pipelines and railroads virtually no oil to ship.
If they managed to get their hands on some oil, Rockefeller rigorously
undersold them to any refineries outside his system, and he seemed to
not care how low the price would go. He also made it hard for Scott to
get his hands on the oil the company needed to lubricate train engines
and wheels.
Pennsylvania Railroad had overextended itself in this campaign and
was losing money at a rapid rate, but Rockefeller had to be losing just
as much. He seemed to be aiming for mutual suicide. Scott was in too
deep to back out of this war, and so he was forced to cut costs by firing
hundreds of railroad workers and reducing wages for those who
remained. Scott’s workers retaliated with a general railroad strike that
quickly turned violent and bloody, as workers spread throughout the
state destroying thousands of Pennsylvania Railroad freight cars. Scott
retaliated brutally, but the strike persisted and the shareholders in the
Pennsylvania Railroad were growing quite nervous. All the while,
Rockefeller seemed unperturbed and continued with his pressure
campaign, as if he had nothing to lose.
Scott had had enough. Somehow Rockefeller could absorb these
huge losses, but he could not. He had literally run out of money. Not
only did he agree to put a stop to his campaign, but he had to sell to
Rockefeller the lion’s share of his refineries, storage tanks, steamships,
and pipelines. Scott would never recover from this humiliating and
rather sudden defeat: a year later he suffered a stroke, and within a few
years he died at the age of fifty-eight.

Although it appeared that Rockefeller’s control of the oil business was
now complete, a businessman and engineer named Byron Benson had
an idea about how to poke a hole in his expanding empire. Rockefeller
could call the shots with his immense resources, but he could not
compete with technological progress. What gave Rockefeller an
advantage was that pipelines were relatively short, at most thirty miles
long. He could dominate by creating pipeline networks all across
Pennsylvania and by controlling many of the railroads operating
between the refineries and the pipelines. Even if someone had an
independent pipeline, at some point he would depend on Standard Oil
to transport the oil the rest of the way.
What if, however, Benson could design something new—one long,
continuous pipeline that would run from the oil fields of western
Pennsylvania to the Eastern Seaboard? In that way he could deliver oil
directly to the few independent East Coast refineries that remained
and guarantee low prices for them, bypassing Rockefeller’s network.
This would halt Rockefeller’s momentum, and with more of these long-
range pipelines, rivals to Standard Oil could begin to compete on fairer
terms.
It would not be easy. The pipeline would require some novel
engineering to make the oil flow upward over the hills and mountains
that would inevitably be in the way, but Benson had been working on
this. And because Rockefeller had made so many enemies and so many
feared his growing monopoly, Benson was able to raise very large sums
of money from investors, more than enough to cover the high cost of
building such a pipeline.
Benson named his enterprise the Tidewater Pipeline Company, and
in 1878 construction began. But almost immediately he had to deal
with an insidious campaign to halt the work on the pipeline. Benson
depended on railroad tank cars to transport the heavy materials to the
construction site, but it seemed that over the years Rockefeller had
bought up the lion’s share of such cars and had virtually cornered the
market. Wherever he turned to find tank cars, Benson ran into
Standard Oil subsidiaries that controlled them. Benson had to find
other means of moving the material, and this added to his costs and
wasted valuable time. All of this only made him more determined to
finish the job and outwit Rockefeller.

[PAGE 530]
This, however, was only the beginning. Benson needed to make his
route to the sea as easy as possible, to save money, and that would
mean running it through Maryland. But now word reached him that,
through lots of generous bribes, Rockefeller had gotten the Maryland
legislature to give an exclusive pipeline charter to Standard Oil. This
meant Tidewater would have to pass through the hillier and even
mountainous areas farther north in Pennsylvania, making the route
more circuitous and the job more expensive.
Then, however, came the most threatening blow of all: Rockefeller
suddenly went on a real estate buying spree, purchasing large tracts of
farmland in Pennsylvania, right in the way of Tidewater’s advance to
the sea. No price seemed too high for Standard Oil to pay. Benson did
what he could to fight back and buy his own land, but rumors began to
spread among the farmers in the area of the danger if they sold parts of
their land to Tidewater—being so long, the pipeline would be subject to
leaks that could ruin their crops. Clearly, Standard Oil was the source
of the rumors, and they had an effect.
To Benson, Rockefeller was like a relentless, invisible demon
attacking him from all directions, ratcheting up the costs and the
pressure. But Benson could be just as relentless. If Rockefeller bought
out an entire valley, Benson made the pipeline change course, even if it
meant going over more hills. The route became a ridiculous zigzag, but
the pipeline kept inching its way east and finally reached the coast in
May of 1879.
Once the pipeline went into operation, however, no one could
predict if its elaborate pumping system could move the oil up steep
climbs. Slowly the first flow of crude oil made its way through the
pipeline, ascending even the highest mountain, and after seven days
the first drops reached the end point. The Tidewater Pipeline was
considered one of the great engineering feats of the day, and Benson
became an overnight hero. Finally someone had outwitted and
outfought Standard Oil.
To Benson’s amazement, however, Rockefeller now only ratcheted
up the pressure. Tidewater had bled money and had little left in
reserve, but here was Rockefeller drastically reducing rates on
Standard Oil’s own pipelines and railroads, transporting oil virtually
for free. Tidewater could not find a drop of oil to ship, and this was
bringing the company to its knees. By March of 1880 Benson had had

[PAGE 531]
enough, and he struck a deal with Standard Oil on the most favorable
terms he could get, joining the two companies. But this was only a
preliminary move. In the months to come, Rockefeller bought up more
and more shares in Tidewater, bringing it completely under his
control. Like so many others before him, in trying to fight against
Rockefeller, Benson had only made him stronger and more invincible.
How could anyone hope to fight against such an indomitable force?

In the 1880s the demand for kerosene to light houses and offices
exploded, and Rockefeller controlled the market. And in cities and
towns across America, local grocers and retailers began to notice a
revolutionary new system introduced by Standard Oil. The company
had set up storage tanks in all corners of the country and financed tank
wagons to transport the kerosene to almost every town. Not only would
Standard Oil salesmen personally sell the company’s kerosene to
stores, but they would also go from house to house, selling heaters and
stoves directly to homeowners, at the lowest prices.
This threatened the business of many local retailers, and when they
protested, Standard Oil representatives would tell them that they
would stop the practice if the retailers sold exclusively Standard Oil
products. For those who refused, Standard Oil would start its own
grocery store in the area and, with cheap prices, drive the rebellious
store owners out of business. In some areas, furious retailers would
turn to a rival company, such as Republic Oil, which specialized in
selling to retailers who hated Rockefeller. Little did they know that
Standard Oil had secretly set up and owned Republic Oil.
With all of these practices Rockefeller had created a growing
number of enemies, but none of them was as dogged and fanatical as
George Rice, a man who had managed to maintain a small,
independent refinery in Ohio. He tried to get lawmakers to investigate
the company’s practices. He published a newsletter called Black Death,
which compiled all the muckraking articles on Rockefeller. And to
somehow find a way to make a profit and snub his nose at Rockefeller,
he decided he would personally travel and sell his own oil in several
towns, bypassing the new system that had cornered the market.

[PAGE 532]
It was hard to imagine that Standard Oil could possibly care about
him; the amount of oil he was trying to sell was miniscule and his
success was quite limited. But when he managed to sell a mere seventy
barrels of kerosene to a retailer in Louisville, suddenly he learned that
the railroad that had agreed, while he was on the road, to ship his oil to
him now refused to carry his product. He knew who was behind this,
but he managed to find other, more expensive means to get shipments
of oil.
He moved to another town near Louisville, only to find Standard Oil
salesmen there who had anticipated his presence and carefully kept
underselling him. He found himself pushed to ever-smaller towns
farther south, but once again there were the Standard Oil men blocking
his way, and soon he could not sell a drop of oil. It was as if they had
spies everywhere and were tracking his progress. But more than
anything, he felt the ubiquitous presence of Rockefeller himself, who
clearly knew of his little campaign and was out to crush this tiniest of
competitors at all costs. Finally realizing what he was truly up against,
Rice gave up the fight and returned home.
—
In the early 1900s, after Rockefeller had resigned as head of Standard
Oil, he began to fascinate the American public. He was by far the
wealthiest man in the world, the first billionaire on the planet, but the
stories of the way he had conducted his battles and the monopoly he
had forged made them wonder about his character. He was a notorious
recluse, and few knew anything concrete about him. Then some among
his many enemies initiated a series of court cases to break up the
Standard Oil monopoly. Rockefeller was forced to testify, and to the
public’s amazement, he was not at all like the devil they had imagined.
As one newspaper writer reported: “He seems the embodiment of
sweetness and light. His serenity could not be disturbed. . . . At times
his manner was mildly reproachful, at others tenderly persuasive, but
never did he betray an ill temper or vexation.”
As he emerged as the world’s most generous philanthropist, and as
the public came to appreciate the cheap oil he provided, they changed
their opinion of him. After all, as the major shareholder in Standard
Oil he had immense influence, and he had agreed to the breakup of the

[PAGE 533]
Standard Oil monopoly. Little did they know that behind the scenes he
operated as he always had done: finding loopholes in the law, keeping
the monopoly together through secret agreements, and maintaining
his control. He would not allow anyone to block his path, and certainly
not the government.

Interpretation: The story of the rise to power of John D. Rockefeller
has to be considered one of the most remarkable in history. In a
relatively short period of time (some twenty years), he rose from the
bottom of society (his family had suffered periods of poverty) to
become the founder and owner of the largest corporation in America,
and shortly after that to emerge as the wealthiest man in the world. In
the process, as so often happens in such cases, his story became
shrouded in all kinds of myths. He was either a demon or a god of
capitalism. But lost in all of these emotional responses is the answer to
a simple question: how did one man—with little help—accumulate so
much power in so little time?
If we examine him closely, we must conclude that it wasn’t through
supreme intelligence or some particular talent or creative vision. He
had some of those qualities, but nothing strong enough to account for
his outrageous success. In truth, what we can attribute it to more than
anything is the sheer relentless force of will that he possessed to utterly
dominate every situation and rival he encountered, and to exploit every
opportunity that crossed his path. We shall call this aggressive energy.
Such energy can have productive purposes (see the last section in the
chapter for more on this), and certainly Rockefeller had some
achievements that benefited the society of his time. But as so often
happens with highly aggressive people, this energy pushed him to
monopolize virtually all power in a complex industry. It made him
wipe out all rivals and any possible competition, bend laws to his
benefit, standardize all practices according to his desires, and in the
end, depress innovation in the field.
Let us divorce Rockefeller’s story from the usual emotional
responses and simply look at him dispassionately, as a kind of
specimen to help us understand the nature of highly aggressive
individuals and what makes large numbers of people submit to their
will. In this way we can also learn some valuable lessons about human

[PAGE 534]
nature and how we can begin to counter those who continually work to
monopolize power, often to the detriment of the rest of us.
Rockefeller grew up in peculiar circumstances. His father, William,
was a notorious con artist. And from the very beginning, the father set
a rather unpleasant pattern for the family: He would leave his wife,
Eliza, and four children (John being the eldest) for months on end in
their flimsy cabin in western New York and travel the region plying his
various con games. During this time, the family would have barely
enough money to survive. Eliza had to find a way to make every penny
count. Then the father would reappear with wads of cash and gifts for
the family. He was amusing (a great storyteller) but at times rather
cruel and even violent. Then he would leave again, and the pattern
would reset. It was impossible to predict when he would return, and
the members of the family were continually on edge when he was there
and when he was not.
As a teenager, John had to go to work to help bring some stability to
the family’s finances. And as he advanced in his career, he could not
escape the anxieties that had plagued him in his childhood. He had a
desperate need to make everything orderly and predictable in his
environment. He immersed himself deeply in his accounting books—
nothing was more predictable than the pluses and minuses on a ledger
sheet. At the same time, he had great ambitions for making a fortune;
his father had instilled in him an almost visceral love of money.
And so, when he first learned of what could be accomplished with
an oil refinery, he saw his great opportunity. But his attraction to the
oil business may seem at first glance rather strange. It was a Wild West
environment, totally anarchic; fortunes could be made or lost in a
matter of months. In many ways, the oil business was like his father—
exciting, promising sudden riches, but treacherously unpredictable.
Unconsciously he was drawn to it for those very reasons—he could
relive his worst fears from childhood and surmount them by
establishing rigorous control over the oil industry. It would be like
conquering the father himself. The chaos would only spur him to
greater heights, as he would have to work doubly hard to tame its
wildness.
And so, in these first years of business, we can see the motivating
factor that would drive all his subsequent actions—the overwhelming
need for control. The more complicated and difficult this task, the

[PAGE 535]
more relentless the energy he would summon to achieve such a goal.
And out of this need came a second one, almost as important—to
justify his aggressive actions to the world and to himself. Rockefeller
was a deeply religious man. He could not live with the thought that
what drove his actions was a desire to control people and acquire the
vast sums of money necessary for such a purpose. That would have
been to see himself in too ugly and soulless a light.
To repress such a thought, he constructed what we shall call the
aggressor’s narrative. He had to convince himself that his quest for
power served some higher purpose. There was a belief at the time
among Protestants that to make a lot of money was a sign of grace
from God. With wealth, the religious individual could give back to the
community and help support the local parish. But Rockefeller took this
further. He believed that establishing order in the oil business was a
divine mission, like ordering the cosmos. He was on a crusade to bring
cheap prices and predictability to American households. Turning
Standard Oil into a monopoly blended seamlessly with his deep
religious convictions.
Sincerely believing in this crusade, it did not bother his conscience
to ruthlessly manipulate and ruin his rivals, to bribe legislators, to run
roughshod over laws, to form fake rival enterprises to Standard Oil, to
spark and use the violence of a strike (with Pennsylvania Railroad) that
would help him in the long run. Belief in this narrative made him all
the more energetic and aggressive, and for those who faced him, it
could be confusing—perhaps there was some good in what he was
doing; perhaps he was not a demon after all.
Finally, to realize his dream of control, Rockefeller transformed
himself into a superior reader of men and their psychology. And the
most important quality for him to gauge in the various rivals he faced
was their relative willpower and resiliency. He could sense this in
people’s body language and in the patterns of their actions. Most
people, he determined, are rather weak. They are mostly led by their
emotions, which change by the day. They want things to be rather easy
in life and tend to take the path of least resistance. They don’t have a
stomach for protracted battles. They want money for the pleasures and
comforts it can bring, for their yachts and mansions. They want to look
powerful, to satisfy their ego. Make them afraid or confused or
frustrated, or offer them an easy way out, and they would surrender to

[PAGE 536]
his stronger will. If they got angry, all the better. Anger burns itself out
quickly, and Rockefeller always played for the long term.
Look at how he played each of the antagonists in his path. With
Clark, he carefully fed his arrogance and deliberately made him
irritable, so that he would quickly agree to the auction just to get rid of
Rockefeller, without thinking too deeply about the consequences.
Colonel Payne was a vain and greedy man. Give him plenty of
money and a nice title, and he would be satisfied and surrender to
Rockefeller his refinery. For the other refinery owners, instill fears
about the uncertain future, using the SIC as a convenient bogeyman.
Make them feel isolated and weak, and sow some panic. Yes, his
refineries were more profitable, as shown by his books, but the other
owners failed to reason that Rockefeller himself was just as vulnerable
as they were to the ups and downs of the business. If only they had
united in opposition to his campaign, they could have countered him,
but they were made too emotional to think straight, and they
surrendered their refineries with ease.
When it came to Scott, Rockefeller saw him as a hothead, enraged
by Standard Oil’s threat to his preeminent position in business.
Rockefeller welcomed the war with Scott and prepared for it by
amassing vast amounts of cash. He would simply outlast him. And the
angrier he made Scott with his unorthodox tactics, the more
imprudent and rash Scott became, going so far as to try to crush the
railroad strike, which only made his position weaker. With Benson,
Rockefeller recognized the type—the man enamored with his own
brilliance and wanting attention as the first one to defeat Standard Oil.
Putting up obstacles in his path would only make him try harder, while
weakening his finances. It would be simple to buy him off in the end,
when he had grown tired of Rockefeller’s relentless pressure.
As an extra measure, Rockefeller would always strategize to make
his opponents feel rushed and impatient. Clark had only one day to
plan for the auction. The refinery owners faced imminent doom in a
few months unless they sold to him. Scott and Benson had to hurry up
in their battles or face running out of money. This made them more
emotional and less able to strategize.
Understand: Rockefeller represents a type of individual that you
will likely come across in your field. We shall call this type the
sophisticated aggressor, as opposed to the primitive aggressor.

[PAGE 537]
Primitive aggressors have very short fuses. If someone triggers in them
feelings of inferiority or weakness, they explode. They lack any self-
control, and so they tend to not get very far in life, inevitably bullying
and hurting too many people. Sophisticated aggressors are much
trickier. They rise to top positions and can stay there because they
know how to cloak their maneuvers, to present a distracting façade,
and to play upon people’s emotions. They know that most people do
not like confrontation or long struggles, and so they can intimidate or
wear people down. They depend on our docility as much as on their
own aggression.
The sophisticated aggressors that you encounter do not have to be
as spectacularly successful as a Rockefeller. They can be your boss, a
rival, or even a scheming colleague on the way up. You can recognize
them by one simple sign: they get to where they’re going primarily
through their aggressive energy, not through their particular talents.
They value amassing power more than the quality of their work. They
do whatever is necessary to secure their position and crush any kind of
competition or challenge. They do not like to share power.
In dealing with this type, you will tend to become angry or fearful,
enlarging their presence and playing into their hands. You obsess over
their evil character and fail to pay close attention to what they are
actually up to. What you often end up surrendering to is the
appearance or illusion of strength that they project, their aggressive
reputation. The way to handle them is to lower the emotional
temperature. Start by looking at the individual, not the myth or legend.
Understand their primary motivation—to gain control over the
environment and the people around them. As with Rockefeller, this
need for control covers up vast layers of anxieties and insecurities. You
must see the frightened child within, terrified by anything
unpredictable. In this way you can cut them down to size, diminishing
their ability to intimidate you.
They want to control your thoughts and reactions. Deny them this
power by focusing on their actions and your strategies, not your
feelings. Analyze and anticipate their real goals. They want to instill in
you the idea that you have no options, that surrender is inevitable and
the best way out. But you always have options. Even if they are your
boss and you must surrender in the present, you can maintain your
inner independence and plot for the day in which they make a mistake

[PAGE 538]
and are weakened, using your knowledge of their vulnerable points to
help take them down.
See through their narrative and their shrewd attempts at
distraction. They will often present themselves as holier-than-thou or
as the victim of other people’s malice. The louder they proclaim their
convictions, the more certain you can be they’re hiding something. Be
aware that they can sometimes seem charming and charismatic. Do
not be mesmerized by such appearances. Look at their patterns of
behavior. If they have taken from people in the past, they will continue
to do so in the present. Never bring on such types as partners, no
matter how friendly and charming they might seem. They like to
piggyback on your hard work, then wrest control. Your realistic
appraisal of their actual strength and their aggressive intentions is
your best defense.
When it comes to taking action against aggressors, you must be as
sophisticated and crafty as they are. Do not try to fight with them
directly. They are too relentless, and they usually have enough power
to overwhelm you in direct confrontation. You must outwit them,
finding unexpected angles of attack. Threaten to expose the hypocrisy
in their narrative or the past dirty deeds they have tried to keep hidden
from the public. Make it seem that a battle with you will be costlier
than they had imagined, that you are also willing to play a little dirty,
but only in defense. If you are particularly clever, appear relatively
weak and exposed, baiting them into a rash attack that you have
prepared for. Often the wisest strategy is to band together with others
who have suffered at their hands, creating strength and leverage in
numbers.
Keep in mind that aggressors often get their way because you fear
that in fighting them, you have too much to lose in the present. But you
must calculate instead what you have to lose in the long term—
decreasing options for power and expansion in your own field, once
they assume a dominating position; your own dignity and sense of self-
worth by not standing up to them. Surrender and docility can become a
habit with devastating consequences for your well-being. Use the
existence of aggressors as a spur to your own fighting spirit and to
build your own confidence. Standing up to and outwitting aggressors
can be one of the most satisfying and ennobling experiences we
humans can have.

[PAGE 539]
Men are not gentle, friendly creatures wishing for love, who simply defend
themselves if attacked. . . . A powerful desire for aggression has to be
reckoned as part of their . . . endowment.

Keys to Human Nature
We like to think of ourselves as relatively peaceful and agreeable
members of society. We are social animals to the core, and we need to
convince ourselves that we are loyal to and cooperative with the
communities we belong to. But on occasion, all of us have acted in
ways that go against this self-opinion. Perhaps it came in a moment
when we felt that our job security was threatened, or that someone was
blocking our career advancement. Or perhaps we believed we were not
getting the attention and recognition that we deserved for our work. Or
maybe it came in a moment of financial insecurity. Or perhaps it
occurred in an intimate relationship in which we felt particularly
frustrated in our attempt to get the other to change his or her behavior,
or we sensed that he or she was going to abandon us.
Out of frustration, anger, insecurity, fear, or impatience we
suddenly found ourselves becoming unusually assertive. We did
something a bit extreme to hold on to our job; we tried to push a
colleague out of our way; we reached for some dubious scheme to
secure easy and fast money; we went too far in trying to get attention;
we turned belligerent and controlling with our partner; we became
vindictive and attacked someone on social media. In such moments,
we crossed a line and became aggressive. Most often, when we act this
way, we rationalize our behavior to ourselves and to others: we had no
choice; we felt threatened; we were being treated unfairly; people were
being unresponsive and harming us; we did not start it. In this way we
are able to maintain our self-opinion as the peaceful creatures we
imagine ourselves to be.
Although we will rarely notice this, we can also observe a subtler
example of our aggressive tendencies coming to the fore. When we face
intimidating types who are more aggressive than we are, we often find
ourselves acting more submissive than usual, and maybe a bit
sycophantic if they have power. But when we face people clearly
weaker and meeker than us, often the lion in us unconsciously
emerges. Perhaps we decide to help them, but mixed in with this is a
feeling of contempt and superiority. We become rather aggressive in

[PAGE 540]
trying to help them, ordering their life, being forceful with our advice.
Or if we have little sympathy for them, we might feel compelled to use
them in some way for our own purposes, and maybe push them
around. All of this occurs unconsciously; we generally do not
experience this as aggressiveness, but nonetheless, as we compare our
inner strength with others’, we cannot help but lower and raise our
aggression level.
We can notice this split—between what we think of ourselves and
how we actually act at times—in the behavior of our friends,
colleagues, and those in the news. In our workplace, inevitably certain
people push their way forward and grab more power. Perhaps they
take credit for our work, or steal our ideas, or push us off a project, or
ally themselves rather vigorously with those in power. We can see on
social media the delight people take in feeling outraged, in attacking
and bringing down others. We can see the energy with which the press
exposes the slightest flaw in those in power, and the feeding frenzy that
ensues. We can observe the rampant violence in our films and games,
all masquerading as entertainment. And all the while nobody admits to
being aggressive. In fact, more than ever people seem so modest and
progressive. The split is profound.
What this means is the following: All of us understand that humans
have been capable of much violence and aggression in the past and in
the present. We know that out there in the world there are sinister
criminals, greedy and unscrupulous businesspeople, belligerent
negotiators, and sexual aggressors. But we create a sharp dividing line
between those examples and us. We have a powerful block against
imagining any kind of continuum or spectrum when it comes to our
own aggressive moments and those of the more extreme variety in
others. We in fact define the word to describe the stronger
manifestations of aggression, excluding ourselves. It is always the
other who is belligerent, who starts things, who is aggressive.
This is a profound misconception of human nature. Aggression is a
tendency that is latent in every single human individual. It is a
tendency wired into our species. We became the preeminent animal on
this planet precisely because of our aggressive energy, supplemented
by our intelligence and cunning. We cannot separate this
aggressiveness from the way we attack problems, alter the
environment to make our lives easier, fight injustice, or create
anything on a large scale. The Latin root of the word aggression means

[PAGE 541]
“to step forward,” and when we assert ourselves in this world and try to
create or change anything, we are tapping into this energy.
Aggression can serve positive purposes. At the same time, under
certain circumstances, this energy can push us into antisocial behavior,
into grabbing too much or pushing people around. These positive and
negative aspects are two sides of the same coin. And although some
individuals are clearly more aggressive than others, all of us are
capable of slipping into that negative side. There is a continuum of
human aggression, and we are all on the spectrum.
Being unaware of our true nature causes us many problems. We can
turn aggressive in the negative sense without realizing what is
happening, and then pay the consequences for going too far. Or,
feeling uncomfortable with our own assertive impulses and knowing
the trouble they can stir, we might try to repress our aggressiveness
and appear to be paragons of humility and goodness, only to become
more passive-aggressive in our behavior. This energy cannot be denied
or repressed; it will emerge in some way. But with awareness, we can
begin to control and channel it for productive and positive purposes.
To do so, we must understand the source of all human aggression, how
it turns negative, and why some people become more aggressive than
others.
The Source of Human Aggression
Unlike any other animal, we humans are aware of our own mortality,
and that we could die at any moment. Consciously and unconsciously
this thought haunts us throughout our lives. We are aware that our
position in life is never secure—we can lose our job, our social status,
and our money, often for reasons beyond our control. The people
around us are equally unpredictable—we can never read their
thoughts, anticipate their actions, or totally rely on their support. We
are dependent on others, who often don’t come through. We have
certain innate desires for love, excitement, and stimulation, and it is
often beyond our control to satisfy these desires in the way we would
like. In addition, we all have certain insecurities that stem from
wounds in our childhood. If events or people trigger these insecurities
and reopen old wounds, we feel particularly vulnerable and weak.

[PAGE 542]
What this means is that we humans are continually plagued by
feelings of helplessness that come from many sources. If this feeling is
strong enough or lasts for too long, it can become unbearable. We are
willful creatures who crave power. This desire for power is not evil or
antisocial; it is a natural response to the awareness of our essential
weakness and vulnerability. In essence, what drives much of our
behavior is to have control over circumstances, to feel the connection
between what we do and what we get—to feel that we can influence
people and events to some extent. This mitigates our sense of
helplessness and makes the unpredictability of life tolerable.
We satisfy this need by developing solid work skills that help us
secure our career status and give us a feeling of control over the future.
We also try to develop social skills that allow us to work with other
people, earn their affection, and have a degree of influence over them.
When it comes to our needs for excitement and stimulation, we
generally choose to satisfy them through various activities—sports,
entertainment, seduction—that our culture provides or accepts.
All of these activities help us to have the control that we crave, but
they require that we recognize certain limits. To gain such power in our
work and relationships, we must be patient. We cannot force things. It
takes time to secure our career position, to develop genuine creative
powers, to learn how to influence people and charm them. It also
requires abiding by certain social codes and even laws. We cannot do
just anything to get ahead in our careers; we cannot force people to do
our bidding. We can call these codes and laws guardrails that we
carefully stay within in order to gain power while remaining liked and
respected.
In certain moments, however, we find it hard to accept these limits.
We cannot advance in our careers or make a lot of money as quickly as
we would like. We cannot get people to work with us to the degree that
we want them to, so we feel frustrated. Or perhaps an old wound from
childhood is suddenly reopened. If we anticipate that a partner could
be ending the relationship, and we have a great fear of being
abandoned stemming from parental coldness, we could easily
overreact and try to control him or her, using all of our manipulative
powers and turning quite aggressive. (Feelings of love often turn to
hostility and aggression in people, because it is in love that we feel
most dependent, vulnerable, and helpless.)

[PAGE 543]
In these cases, our hunger for more money, power, love, or
attention overwhelms any patience we might have had. We might then
be tempted to go outside the guardrails, to seek power and control in a
way that violates tacit codes and even laws. But for most of us, when
we cross the line, we feel uncomfortable and perhaps remorseful. We
scurry back to within the guardrails, to our normal ways of trying for
power and control. Such aggressive acts can occur at moments in our
lives, but they do not become a pattern.
This is not the case, however, with more chronically aggressive
types. The sense of helplessness or frustration that we may feel upon
occasion plagues them more deeply and more often. They feel
chronically insecure and fragile and must cover this with an inordinate
amount of power and control. Their need for power is too immediate
and strong for them to accept the limits, and overrides any sense of
compunction or social responsibility.
It is possible that there is a genetic component to this. The
psychoanalyst Melanie Klein, who specialized in the study of infants,
noticed that some babies were decidedly more anxious and greedier
than others. From their very first days, they would suckle on the
mother’s breast as if they were attacking it and wanting to suck it dry.
They needed more coddling and attention than others. Their crying
and tantrums were almost impossible to stop. They felt a higher degree
of helplessness that verged on continual hysteria.
Such babies were in the minority, but she noticed them often
enough. She speculated that those who are chronically aggressive could
be adult versions of the greedy baby. They are simply born with a
greater need to control everything around them. They brood more over
feelings of hurt or envy—“Why should other people have more than
me?” When they feel like they are losing control to any degree, their
tendency is to exaggerate the threat, to overreact and grab for much
more than is necessary.
It is also true that early family life can play a decisive role.
According to the psychoanalyst and writer Erich Fromm, if parents are
too domineering, if they repress their children’s need for power and
independence, such children are often the types who later like to
dominate and tyrannize others. If they were beaten as children, they
often resort to beating and physical abuse as adults. In this way, they
turn the enforced passivity in their childhood into something active as

[PAGE 544]
adults, giving them the feeling of control they sorely lacked in their
earliest years, through aggressive behavior.
Whatever the cause of their tendencies, these types do not scurry
back within the guardrails but rather continually resort to aggressive
behavior. They have an unusually strong will and little patience to
satisfy their desires through the socially acceptable channels. They find
the normal ways of gaining stimulation too dull. They need something
stronger and more immediate. If they are the primitive type, they may
turn to criminal behavior or simply become the overt bully; if they are
more sophisticated, they will learn to control this behavior to some
extent and use it when necessary.
What this means is that human aggression stems from an
underlying insecurity, as opposed to simply an impulse to hurt or take
from others. Before any impulse to take aggressive action, aggressors
are unconsciously processing feelings of helplessness and anxiety.
They often perceive threats that are not really there, or exaggerate
them. They take action to preempt the perceived attack of another, or
to grab for things in order to dominate a situation they feel may elude
their control. (Such feelings also provoke the positive type of
aggression as well. Feeling the need to fight an injustice or create
something important is preceded by feelings of anxiety and insecurity.
It remains an attempt at control for positive purposes.) When we look
at any chronic aggressor around us, we must search for the underlying
insecurity, the deep wound, the reverberating feelings of helplessness
from their earliest years.
We can notice the following interesting phenomenon: people who
are domineering often are extremely intolerant of any kind of dissent.
They need to be surrounded by sycophants and constantly be
reminded of their greatness and superiority. If such types have
political power, they work to tamp down any negative publicity and
control what people say about them. We must see this hypersensitivity
to criticism as a sign of great inner weakness. A person who is truly
strong from within can endure criticism and open discussion without
feeling personally threatened. Generally, aggressors and authoritarian
types are expert at concealing this profound inner weakness by
constantly projecting toughness and conviction. But we must train
ourselves to look past their façade and see the inner fragility. This can
greatly help us control any feelings of fear or intimidation, which
aggressors love to stimulate.

[PAGE 545]
There are other qualities of the chronically aggressive that we must
understand. First, aggressors have less tolerance for feelings of
helplessness and anxiety than the rest of us. What might cause us to
feel frustrated or insecure will often trigger in them a much more
powerful reaction, and rage. This is perhaps why chronic aggression is
much more common among men than women. Men find it harder to
manage feelings of dependency and helplessness, something
psychologists have noted in male infants. Men are generally more
insecure about their status in the work world and elsewhere. They have
a greater need to continually assert themselves and gauge their effect
on others. Their self-esteem is tied to feelings of power, control, and
respect for their opinions. And so it often takes less to trigger the
aggressive response in men. In any event, we must always be aware
that the chronic aggressor is more thin-skinned than we are, and if we
know we are dealing with this type, we must be particularly careful to
not inadvertently trigger their rage response by challenging their self-
esteem or criticizing them.
Another common aspect of aggressive behavior is that it can easily
become an addiction. In acting out their desires in an overt and
immediate way, in getting the best of people through their maneuvers,
aggressors receive a jolt of adrenaline that can become addictive. They
feel stimulated and excited, and the more socially acceptable ways of
relieving boredom can seem tepid in comparison. (Certainly the thrill
of getting easy money, whether as Wall Street brokers peddling
dubious investments or as criminals stealing what they can, has an
immensely addictive quality.) At first glance, this might seem self-
destructive, as each aggressive outburst creates more enemies and
unintended consequences. But aggressors are often adept at upping
the ante with even more intimidating behavior, so that few will
challenge them.
This often leads to the phenomenon of the aggressor’s trap: the
more power they get, and the larger their empire, the more points of
vulnerability they create; they have more rivals and enemies to worry
about. This sparks in them the need to be more and more aggressive
and gain more and more power. (Certainly Rockefeller fell victim to
this dynamic.) They also come to feel that to stop acting in this way
would make them seem weak. No matter what aggressors might say to
us or how they try to disguise their intentions, we must realize that
their past pattern of behavior will inevitably continue in the present,

[PAGE 546]
because they are both addicted and trapped. We must never be naive in
dealing with them. They will be relentless. If they take a step back, it is
only momentary. They are rarely capable of changing this essential
pattern in their behavior.
We must also be aware that aggressors see the people around them
as objects to use. They might have some natural empathy, but because
their need for power and control is so strong, they cannot be patient
enough to rely solely upon charm and social skills. To get what they
want, they have to use people, and this becomes a habit that degrades
any empathy they once had. They need adherents and disciples, so they
train themselves to listen, to occasionally praise others, and to do
favors for people. The charm they may display upon occasion,
however, is only for effect and has little human warmth to it. When
they are listening to us, they are gauging the strength of our will and
seeing how we can serve their purposes down the road. If they praise
us or do us a favor, it is a way to further entrap and compromise us.
We can see this in the nonverbal cues, in the eyes that look through us,
in how thinly they are engaged in our stories. We must always try to
make ourselves immune to any attempt at charm on their part,
knowing what purpose it serves.
It is interesting to note that despite all of the socially negative
qualities that aggressors inevitably reveal, they are frequently able to
attract enough followers to help them in their quest for power. The
people who are attracted to such aggressors often have their own deep-
seated issues, their own frustrated aggressive desires. They find the
confidence and sometimes brazenness of the aggressor quite exciting
and appealing. They fall in love with the narrative. They become
infected with the leader’s aggression and get to act it out on others,
perhaps those below them. But such an environment is tiring, and
those serving the aggressor are constantly taking hits to their self-
esteem. With most aggressors, the turnover is high and the morale low.
As the ancient Greek dramatist Sophocles once wrote, “Whoever
makes his way into a tyrant’s court becomes his slave, although he
went there a free man.”

[PAGE 547]
Your task as a student of human nature is threefold: First, you must
stop denying the reality of your own aggressive tendencies. You are on
the aggressive spectrum, like all of us. Of course, there are some people
who are lower down on this spectrum. Perhaps they lack confidence in
their ability to get what they want; or they may simply have less
energy. But a lot of us are in the mid-to-upper range on the spectrum,
with relatively strong levels of will. This assertive energy must be
expended in some way and will tend to go in one of three directions.
First, we can channel this energy into our work, into patiently
achieving things (controlled aggression). Second, we can channel it
into aggressive or passive-aggressive behavior. Finally, we can turn it
inward in the form of self-loathing, directing our anger and aggression
at our own failings and activating our internal saboteur (more on this
later). You need to analyze how you handle your assertive energy. A
way to judge yourself is to see how you handle moments of frustration
and uncertainty, situations in which you have less control. Do you tend
to lash out, grow angry and tense, and do things you later regret? Or do
you internalize the anger and grow depressed? Look at those inevitable
moments in which you have gone past the guardrails and analyze
them. You are not as peaceful and gentle as you imagine. Notice what
pushed you into this behavior, and how during such times you found
ways to rationalize your behavior. Now, with some distance, you can
perhaps see through those rationalizations.
Your goal is not to repress this assertive energy but to become
aware of it as it drives you forward and to channel it productively. You
need to admit to yourself that you have a deep desire to have an effect
on people, to have power, and to realize this you must develop higher
social and technical skills, must become more patient and resilient.
You need to discipline and tame your natural assertive energy. This is
what we shall call controlled aggression, and it will lead to
accomplishing great things. (For more on this, see the last section of
this chapter.)
Your second task is to make yourself a master observer of
aggression in the people around you. When you look at your work
world, for instance, imagine that you can visualize the continual war
between people’s different levels of will, and all of the intersecting
arrows of such conflicts. Those who are more assertive seem to rise to
the top, but they inevitably display signs of submission to those higher
up. It is not much different from the hierarchies we can observe among

[PAGE 548]
chimpanzees. If you stop focusing on people’s words and the façade
they present, and concentrate on their actions and their nonverbal
cues, you can almost sense the level of aggressiveness they emanate.
In looking at this phenomenon, it is important that you be tolerant
of people: we have all crossed the line at some point and turned more
aggressive than usual, often because of circumstances. When it comes
to those who are powerful and successful, it is impossible in this world
to reach such heights without higher levels of aggression and some
manipulation. For accomplishing great things, we can forgive them
their occasional harsh and assertive behavior. What you need to
determine is whether you are dealing with chronic aggressors, people
who cannot tolerate criticism or being challenged on any level, whose
desire for control is excessive, and who will swallow you up in their
relentless quest to have more.
Look for some telltale signs. First, if they have an unusually high
number of enemies whom they have accumulated over the years, there
must be a good reason, and not the one they tell you. Pay close
attention to how they justify their actions in the world. Aggressors will
tend to present themselves as crusaders, as some form of genius who
cannot help the way they behave. They are creating great art, they say,
or helping the little man. People who get in their way are infidels and
evil. They will claim, as Rockefeller did, that no one has been criticized
or investigated as much as they have; they are the victims, not the
aggressors. The louder and more extreme their narrative, the more you
can be certain you are dealing with chronic aggressors. Focus on their
actions, their past patterns of behavior, much more than anything they
say.
You can look for subtler signs as well. Chronic aggressors often have
obsessive personalities. Having meticulous habits and creating a
completely predictable environment is their way of holding control.
Obsessing over an object or a person indicates a desire to swallow it
whole. Also, pay attention to the nonverbal cues. We saw with
Rockefeller that he could not stand to be passed by anyone in the
street. The aggressor type will show such physical obsessions—always
front and center. In any event, the earlier you can spot the signs the
better.
Once you realize you are dealing with this type, you must use every
ounce of your energy to disengage mentally, to gain control of your

[PAGE 549]
emotional response. Often what happens when you face aggressors is
that you initially feel mesmerized and even paralyzed to some extent,
as if in the presence of a snake. Then, as you process what they have
done, you become emotional—angry, outraged, frightened. Once you
are in that state, they find it easy to keep you reacting and not thinking.
Your anger doesn’t lead to anything productive but rather melts into
bitterness and frustration over time. Your only answer is to find a way
to detach from their spell, bit by bit. See through their maneuvers,
contemplate the underlying weakness that propels them, cut them
down to size. Always focus on their goals, what they are really after,
and not the distractions they set up.
If battle with them is inevitable, never engage in direct
confrontation or challenge them in an overt way. If they are the
sophisticated type, they will use all their cunning to ruin you, and they
can be relentless. You must always fight them indirectly. Look for the
vulnerabilities they are inevitably covering up. This could be their
dubious reputation, some particularly dirty actions in the past they
have managed to keep secret. Poke holes in their narrative. Through
exposure of what they want to keep hidden, you have a powerful
weapon to scare them out of attacking you. Remember that their
greatest fear is to lose control. Think of what act of yours could
frighten them by setting off a chain reaction of events that might spin
out of control. Make the easy victory they are counting on with you
suddenly seem more expensive.
Aggressors generally have the advantage that they are willing to go
outside the guardrails more often and more widely in fighting you.
This gives them more options, more dirty maneuvers they can surprise
you with. In negotiations, they will hit you with some last-minute
change to what they had agreed upon, violating all rules but knowing
you will give in because you have come this far and don’t want to blow
it up. They will spread rumors and disinformation to muddy the waters
and make you seem as dubious as they are. You must try to anticipate
these manipulations and rob aggressors of the element of surprise.
And on occasion you yourself must be willing to venture outside the
guardrails as well, knowing this is a temporary and defensive measure.
You can practice deception and distract them, appearing weaker than
you are, baiting them into an attack that will make them look bad and
for which you have prepared a crafty counterattack. You can even
spread rumors that will tend to imbalance their minds, since they are

[PAGE 550]
not used to others playing the same tricks back on them. In any event,
with the stakes being high, you must calculate that defeating
aggressors is more important than maintaining your purity.
Finally, your third task as a student of human nature is to rid
yourself of the denial of the very real aggressive tendencies in human
nature itself and what such aggression might mean for our future as a
species. This denial tends to take the form of one of two myths you are
likely to believe in. The first myth is that long ago we humans were
peace-loving creatures, in harmony with nature and with our fellow
humans. It is the myth of the noble savage, the innocent hunter-
gatherer. The implication is that civilization, along with the
development of private property and capitalism, turned the peaceful
human into an aggressive and selfish creature. Our form of society is to
blame for this, so the myth goes. By developing a more egalitarian
political and social system, we could revert to our natural goodness
and peace-loving nature.
Recent finds in anthropology and archaeology, however, have
proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that our ancestors (going back tens
of thousands of years, well before civilization) engaged in warfare that
was as murderous and brutal as anything in the present. They were
hardly peaceful. There are also numerous examples of indigenous
cultures destroying much of the flora and fauna in their environment
in an endless quest for food sources and shelter, sending many species
into extinction and despoiling entire regions of trees. (For more on this
see War Before Civilization, by Lawrence H. Keeley, and The Third
Chimpanzee, by Jared Diamond.) The great power of humans to
cooperate in these cultures was just as often used to help engage in the
bloodiest of skirmishes.
The other myth, more prevalent today, is that we may have been
violent and aggressive in the past, but that we are currently evolving
beyond this, becoming more tolerant, enlightened, and guided by our
better angels. But the signs of human aggression are just as prevalent
in our era as in the past. We can hold up as evidence the endless cycles
of war, the acts of genocide, and the increasing hostility between states
and ethnicities within states that continue well into this century. The
immense powers of technology have only enhanced our destructive
powers when it comes to war. And our depredation of the environment
has only gotten substantially worse, despite our awareness of the
problem.

[PAGE 551]
We can also take note of the growing levels of inequality in power
and wealth around the globe in recent times, approaching the
disparities that existed centuries ago. Such inequalities continue to
reproduce themselves in human society because inevitably there are
individuals who are simply more aggressive than others when it comes
to accumulating power and wealth. No rules or laws seem to stop this.
The powerful write the rules to benefit themselves. And the
monopolizing tendencies of the nineteenth century, as exemplified by
Standard Oil, signs of corporate aggression, have just reshaped
themselves to fit the newest industries.
In the past, people attended executions as a form of entertainment.
We may not go that far, but more people than ever enjoy watching
others being humiliated on reality shows or in the news, and indulging
in games and movies that delight in graphic depictions of murder and
bloodshed. (We can also see an increasingly aggressive edge to our
humor.)
With technology, it has become easier to express and satisfy our
aggressive desires. Without having to physically face people, on the
internet our arguments and criticisms can become that much more
hostile, heated, and personal. The internet has also created a new and
powerful weapon—cyberwar. As they always have, criminals simply co-
opt technology to become more creative and elusive.
Human aggression simply adapts to the newest media and
technological innovations, finding ways to express and vent itself
through them. Whatever the new invention is in one hundred years for
communication, it will likely suffer the same fate. As Gustave Flaubert
put it, “Speak of progress as much as you want. Even when you take
out the canines of a tiger, and he can only eat gruel, his heart remains
that of a carnivore.”
Human aggression in individuals and in groups tends to emerge or
heat up when we feel helpless and vulnerable, when the impatience for
control and effect rises. And as increasing numbers of people and
groups are feeling this way, we can expect more of this and not less in
the future. Wars will get dirtier. As insecurities rise, there will be more
confrontations between political groups, between cultures, between
generations, between men and women. And there will be even better
and more sophisticated ways for humans to justify their aggression to
themselves and to the world.

[PAGE 552]
The denial is stronger than ever—it is always the other person, the
other side, the other culture that is more aggressive and destructive.
We must finally come to terms with the fact that it is not the other but
ourselves, all of us, no matter the time or the culture. We must own
this fact of our nature before we can even begin to consider moving
beyond it. It is only in our awareness that we can start to think of
progress.
Passive Aggression—Its Strategies and How to Counter
Them
Most of us are afraid of outright confrontation; we want to appear
reasonably polite and sociable. But often it is impossible to get what we
want without asserting ourselves in some way. People can be stubborn
and resistant to our influence, no matter how congenial we are. And
sometimes we need a release from all of the inner tension that comes
from having to be so deferential and correct. And so all of us inevitably
engage in behavior in which we assert ourselves indirectly, striving for
control or influence as subtly as possible. Perhaps we take extra time to
respond to people’s communications, to signal a slight bit of disdain
for them; or we seem to praise people but insert subtle digs that get
under their skin and instill doubts. Sometimes we make a comment
that could be taken as quite neutral, but our tone of voice and the
expression on our face indicate we are upset, stirring up some guilt.
We can call this form of aggression passive, in that we give the
appearance that we are merely being ourselves, not actively
manipulating or trying to influence people. Nevertheless, a message is
sent that creates the effect we desire. We are never quite as passive as
we seem in this. In the back of our minds, we are aware that we are
taking an extra long time to get back to someone or putting a dig in a
comment, but at the same time we can also pretend to ourselves and to
others that we are innocent. (We humans are capable of holding such
conflicting thoughts at the same time.) In general, we must consider
this everyday version of passive aggression to be merely an irritating
part of social life, something we are all guilty of. We should be as
tolerant as possible of this low-grade passive aggression that thrives in
polite society.
Some people, however, are chronic passive aggressors. Like the
more active aggressors, they generally have a high degree of energy

[PAGE 553]
and need for control but at the same time a fear of outright
confrontation. They often had domineering or neglectful parents;
passive aggression became their way of getting attention or asserting
their will while avoiding punishment. Such behavior becomes a pattern
for them as adults, as they often repeat the same types of strategies
that worked in childhood. (If we observe the passive aggressor closely
enough, we can often see the manipulative child peeking through the
adult mask.)
These chronic types operate in a personal or work relationship, in
which their drip-drip passive-aggressive strategies can take effect on
an individual over time. They are masters at being ambiguous and
elusive—we can never quite be sure that they are attacking us; perhaps
we are imagining things and are paranoid. If they were directly
aggressive, we would get angry and resist them, but by being indirect
they sow confusion, and exploit such confusion for power and control.
If they are truly good at this and get their hooks into our emotions,
they can make our lives miserable.
Keep in mind that actively aggressive types can generally be quite
passive-aggressive at times, as Rockefeller certainly was. Passive
aggression is simply an additional weapon for them in their attempts
at control. In any event, the key to defending ourselves against passive
aggressors is to recognize what they are up to as early as possible.
The following are the most common strategies employed by such
aggressors, and ways to counter them.
The Subtle-Superiority Strategy: A friend, colleague, or
employee is chronically late, but he or she always has a ready excuse
that is logical, along with an apology that seems sincere. Or similarly,
such individuals forget about meetings, important dates, and
deadlines, always with impeccable excuses at hand. If this behavior
repeats often enough, your irritation will increase, but if you try to
confront them, they very well might try to turn the tables by making
you seem uptight and unsympathetic. It is not their fault, they say—
they have too much on their mind, people are pressuring them, they
are temperamental artists who can’t keep on top of so many irritating
details, they are overwhelmed. They may even accuse you of adding to
their stress.
You must understand that at the root of this is the need to make it
clear to themselves and to you that they are in some way superior. If

[PAGE 554]
they were to say in so many words that they felt superior to you, they
would incur ridicule and shame. They want you to feel it in subtle
ways, while they are able to deny what they are up to. Putting you in
the inferior position is a form of control, in which they get to define the
relationship. You must pay attention to the pattern more than the
apologies, but also notice the nonverbal signs as they excuse
themselves. The tone of the voice is whiny, as if they really feel it is
your problem. The apologies are laid on extra thick to disguise the lack
of sincerity; in the end, such excuses communicate more about their
problems in life than about the facts of their forgetfulness. They are
not really sorry.
If this is chronic behavior, you must not get angry or display overt
irritation—passive aggressors thrive on getting a rise out of you.
Instead, stay calm and subtly mirror their behavior, calling attention to
what they are doing, and inducing some shame if possible. You might
make dates or appointments and leave them in the lurch, or show up
impossibly late with the sincerest of apologies, laced with a touch of
irony. Let them brood on what this might mean.
Earlier on in his career, when the renowned psychotherapist Milton
Erickson was a medical professor at a university, he had to deal with a
very smart student named Anne, who always showed up late to classes,
then apologized profusely and very sincerely. She happened to be a
straight-A student. She always promised to be on time for the next
class but never was. This made it difficult for her fellow students; she
frequently held up lectures or laboratory work. And on the first day of
one of Erickson’s lecture classes she was up to her old tricks, but
Erickson was prepared. When she entered late, he had the entire class
stand up and bow down to her in mock reverence; he did the same.
Even after class, as she walked down the hall, the students continued
their bowing. The message was clear—“We see through you”—and
feeling embarrassed and ashamed, she stopped showing up late.
If you are dealing with a boss or someone in a position of power
who makes you wait, their assertion of superiority is not so subtle. The
best you can do is keep as calm as possible, showing your own form of
superiority by remaining patient and cool.
The Sympathy Strategy: Somehow the person you are dealing
with is always the victim—of irrational hostility, of unfair
circumstances, of society in general. You notice with these types that

[PAGE 555]
they seem to relish the drama in their stories. No one else suffers as
they do. If you are careful, you can detect a vaguely bored expression
when they listen to other people’s problems; they are not so engaged.
Because they play up their supposed helplessness, you will naturally
feel sympathetic, and once they elicit this, they will ask for favors, extra
care, and attention. That is the control they are after. They are
hypersensitive to any signs of doubt on your face, and they don’t want
to hear advice or how they might be slightly to blame. They may
explode and classify you as one of the victimizers.
What might make this hard to see through is that often they do
suffer through unusual adversity and personal pain, but they are
masters at attracting the pain. They choose partners who will
disappoint them; they have a bad attitude at work and attract criticism;
they are negligent with details, and so things around them fall apart. It
is not malicious fate that is to blame but something from within them
that wants and feeds off the drama. People who are genuine victims
cannot help but feel some shame and embarrassment at their fate, part
of an age-old human superstition that a person’s bad luck is a sign of
something wrong with the individual. These true victims do not enjoy
telling their stories. They do so reluctantly. Passive aggressors, on the
other hand, are dying to share what has happened to them and bask in
your attention.
As part of this, passive aggressors may display various symptoms
and ailments—anxiety attacks, depression, headaches—that make their
suffering seem quite real. Since childhood, we have all been capable of
willing such symptoms to get attention and sympathy. We can make
ourselves sick with worry; we can think our way into depression. What
you are looking for is the pattern: this seems to recur in passive
aggressors when they need something (such as a favor), when they feel
you pulling away, when they feel particularly insecure. In any case,
they tend to soak up your time and mental space, infecting you with
their negative energy and needs, and it is very hard to disengage.
These types will often prey upon those who are prone to feel guilty—
the sensitive, caregiving types. To deal with the manipulation involved
here you need some distance, and this is not easy. The only way to do
this is to feel some anger and resentment at the time and energy you
are wasting in trying to help them, and how little they give back to you.
The relationship inevitably tilts in their favor when it comes to
attention. That is their power. Creating some inner distance will allow

[PAGE 556]
you to see through them better and eventually quit the unhealthy
relationship. Do not feel bad about this. You will be surprised at how
quickly they find another target.
The Dependency Strategy: You are suddenly befriended by
someone who is unusually attentive and concerned for your welfare.
They want to help you with your work or some other tasks. They want
to listen to your stories of hardship and adversity. How refreshing and
unusual to have such attention. You find yourself becoming ever so
dependent on what they give you. But every now and then you detect
some coldness on their part, and you rack your brain to figure out what
you might have said or done to trigger this. In fact, you can’t really be
sure if they’re upset with you, but you find yourself trying to please
them nonetheless, and slowly, without really noticing it, the dynamic is
reversed, and the displays of sympathy and concern seem to shift from
them to you.
Sometimes a similar dynamic is played out between parents and
their children. A mother, for instance, can shower her daughter with
affection and love, keeping the girl bound to her. If the daughter tries
to exercise independence at some point, the mother responds as if this
were an aggressive and unloving act on the daughter’s part. To avoid
feeling guilty, the daughter stops asserting herself and works harder to
earn more of the affection she has become dependent on. The
relationship has reversed itself. Later, the mother exercises control
over other aspects of her daughter’s life, including money, career, and
intimate partners. This can also occur within couples.
A variation of this strategy comes from people who love to make
promises (of assistance, money, a job), but don’t quite deliver on them.
Somehow they forget what they had promised, or only give you part of
it, always with a reasonable excuse. If you complain, they may accuse
you of being greedy or insensitive. You have to chase after them to
make up for your rudeness or to beg to get some of what they had
promised.
In any event, this strategy is all about gaining power over another.
The person who is made to feel dependent is returned to the position
of the needy and vulnerable child, wanting more. It is hard to imagine
that someone who is or was so attentive could be using this as a ploy,
which makes it doubly hard to see through. You must be wary of those
who are too solicitous too early on in a relationship. It is unnatural, as

[PAGE 557]
we are normally a bit suspicious of people in the beginning of any
relationship. They may be trying to make you dependent in some way,
and so you must keep some distance before you can truly gauge their
motives. If they start to turn cold and you are confused as to what you
did, you can be nearly certain they are using this strategy. If they react
with anger or dismay when you try to establish some distance or
independence, you can clearly see the power game as it emerges.
Getting out of any such relationships should be a priority.
In general, be wary about people’s promises and never completely
rely on them. With those who fail to deliver, it is more likely a pattern,
and it is best to have nothing more to do with them.
The Insinuating-Doubt Strategy: In the course of a
conversation, someone you know, perhaps a friend, lets slip a
comment that makes you wonder about yourself and if they are in
some way insulting you. Perhaps they commend you on your latest
work, and with a faint smile they say they imagine you will get lots of
attention for it, or lots of money, the implication being that that was
your somewhat dubious motive. Or they seem to damn you with faint
praise: “You did quite well for someone of your background.”
Robespierre, one of the leaders of the Terror of the French
Revolution, was the absolute master of this strategy. He came to see
Georges Danton, a friend and fellow leader, as having become an
enemy of the revolution, but did not want to say this outright. He
wanted to insinuate it to others and strike some fear in Danton. In one
instance, at an assembly, Robespierre leaped to his feet to support his
friend, who had been accused of using his power in the government to
make money. In defending Danton, Robespierre carefully repeated all
of the various charges leveled against him in great detail, then
concluded, “I may be wrong about Danton, but, as a family man, he
deserves nothing but praise.”
As a variation on this, people may say some rather harsh things
about you, and if you seem upset, they will say they were kidding:
“Can’t you take a joke?” They may interpret things you have said in a
slightly negative light, and if you call them on this, they will innocently
reply, “But I’m only repeating what you said.” They may use these
insinuating comments behind your back as well, to sow doubts in other
people’s minds about you. They will also be the first ones to report to

[PAGE 558]
you any bad news, or bad reviews, or the criticisms of others, always
expressed with sympathy, but secretly delighting in your pain.
The point of this strategy is to make you feel bad in a way that gets
under your skin and causes you to think of the insinuation for days.
They want to strike blows at your self-esteem. Most often they are
operating out of envy. The best counter is to show that their
insinuations have no effect on you. You remain calm. You “agree” with
their faint praise, and perhaps you return it in kind. They want to get a
rise out of you, and you will not give them this pleasure. Hinting that
you might see through them will perhaps infect them with their own
doubts, a lesson worth delivering.
The Blame-Shifter Strategy: With certain people, you feel
irritated and upset by something they have done. Perhaps you have felt
used by them, or they’ve been insensitive or ignored your pleas to stop
behavior that is unpleasant. Even before you express your annoyance,
they seem to have picked up your mood, and you can detect some
sulking on their part. And when you do confront them, they grow
silent, wearing a hurt or disappointed look. It is not the silence of
someone with remorse. They may respond with a “Fine. Whatever. If
that’s how you feel.” Any apologies on their part are said in a way
(through tone of voice or facial expressions) that subtly conveys some
disbelief that they have done anything wrong.
If they are really clever, in response they might conjure up
something you’ve said or done in the past, which you’ve forgotten but
which still rankles them, as if you are not so innocent. It doesn’t sound
like something you’ve said or done, but you can’t be sure. Perhaps they
will say something in their defense that pushes your buttons, and as
you get angry, they can now accuse you of being hostile, aggressive,
and unfair.
Whatever their type of response, you are left with the feeling that
perhaps you were wrong all along. Maybe you overreacted or were
paranoid. You might even slightly doubt your sanity—you know you
felt upset, but maybe you can’t trust your own feelings. Now you are
the one to feel guilty, as if you were to blame for the tension. Better to
reassess yourself and not repeat this unpleasant experience, you tell
yourself. As an adjunct to this strategy, passive aggressors are often
quite nice and polite to other people, only playing their games on you,
since you are the one they want to control. If you try to confide in

[PAGE 559]
people your confusion and anger, you get no sympathy, and the blame
shifting has double the effect.
This strategy is a way of covering up all kinds of unpleasant
behavior, of deflecting any kind of criticism, and of making people
skittish about ever calling them on what they are doing. In this way
they can gain power over your emotions and manipulate them as they
see fit, doing whatever they want with impunity. They are exploiting
the fact that many of us, since early childhood, are prone to feeling
guilty at the slightest impetus. This strategy is used most obviously in
personal relationships, but you will find it in more diffused form in the
work world. People will use their hypersensitivity to any criticism, and
the ensuing drama they stir up, to dissuade people from ever trying to
confront them.
To counter this strategy, you need to be able to see through the
blame shifting and remain unaffected by it. Your goal is not to make
them angry, so don’t get caught in the trap of exchanging
recriminations. They are better at this drama game than you are, and
they thrive by their power to rankle you. Be calm and even fair,
accepting some of the blame for the problem, if that seems right.
Realize that it is very difficult to get such types to reflect on their
behavior and change it; they are too hypersensitive for this.
What you want is to have the requisite distance to see through them
and to disengage. To help in this, you must learn to trust your past
feelings. In the moments they are irritating you, write down what they
are doing and memorialize their behavior. Perhaps in doing so, you
will realize that you are in fact overreacting. But if not, you can return
to these notes to convince yourself that you are not crazy and to stop
the blame-shifting mechanism in its tracks. If you don’t allow the
shifting to occur, they might be discouraged from using this strategy. If
not, it is best to lessen your involvement with such a passive aggressor.
The Passive-Tyrant Strategy: The person you are working for
seems to be bubbling with energy, ideas, and charisma. They are a bit
disorganized, but that is normal—they have so much to do, so much
responsibility and so many plans, they can’t keep on top of it all. They
need your help, and you strain every fiber of your being to provide it.
You listen extra hard to their instructions and try to execute them.
Occasionally they praise you, and this keeps you going, but sometimes

[PAGE 560]
they rail at you for letting them down, and this sticks in your mind
more than the praise.
You can never feel comfortable or take your position for granted.
You have to try harder to avoid these nasty temperamental rants.
They’re such perfectionists, with such high standards, and you’re not
measuring up. You rack your brain to anticipate their needs and live in
terror of displeasing them. If they were actively ordering you around,
you would simply do what they asked. But by being somewhat passive
and moody, they force you to work doubly hard to please them.
This strategy is generally used by those in power on their
underlings, but it could be applied by people in relationships, one
partner tyrannizing the other by simply being impossible to please. The
strategy is based on the following logic: If people know what it is that
you want and how to get it for you, they have some power over you. If
they follow your instructions and do your bidding, you cannot criticize
them. If they are consistent, you can even grow dependent on their
work, and they can squeeze concessions out of you by threatening to
leave. But if they have no idea what actually works, if they can’t exactly
discern what kind of behavior draws praise and what draws
punishment, they have no power, no independence, and can be made
to do anything. As with a dog, an occasional pat on their shoulder will
deepen their submission. This was how Michael Eisner exercised
dictatorial control over everyone around him, including Jeffrey
Katzenberg (see
