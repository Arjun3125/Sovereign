chapter 4.)
You select for this team people who have skills that you lack, each
individual with their particular strengths. They know their roles. You
also want this team of lieutenants to be diverse in temperament,
background, and ideas. They show a willingness to speak up and take
initiative, all within the framework of the group’s purpose. They can

[PAGE 477]
even challenge some rules that seem outdated. Feeling a part of a team
but able to bring their own creativity to the tasks will bring out the best
in them, and this spirit will spread throughout the group.
For this team of lieutenants, and for the group as a whole, you want
to make sure that members are treated more or less equally—no one
has special privileges; rewards and punishments are doled out fairly
and evenly. If particular individuals are not living up to the ideal, you
get rid of them. Now if you bring in new lieutenants, they naturally are
absorbed into the healthy dynamic. You are also leading from the
front. If there are sacrifices to be made, you share in them as much as
any member. In doing all of this, you will make it harder for people to
feel envious and resentful, which can sow divisions and make people
political.
Let information and ideas flow freely. As the group evolves, your
greatest danger is the slow formation of a bubble around you. The
lieutenants, trying to ease your burdens, may eventually isolate you
from what is happening throughout the group and filter the
information they provide you. Without realizing it, they tell you what
they believe will please you and keep out the noise that is important to
hear. Your perspective on reality slowly becomes distorted and your
decisions reflect this.
Without becoming overwhelmed by details, you need to establish a
very different dynamic. Consider the open communication of ideas and
information—about rivals, about what is happening on the streets or
among your audience—the lifeblood of the group. This was the secret
to the success of Napoleon Bonaparte on the battlefield. He personally
reviewed the concise reports sent to him by his field marshals,
lieutenants, and others all the way down the chain of command,
including even foot soldiers. This gave him several lines of perspective
as to the performance of the army and the actions of the enemy. He
wanted as much unfiltered information as possible before deciding on
a strategy. He kept such reports to a reasonably small number, but
their diversity is what gave him such a clear picture.
To achieve this, you want to encourage frank discussion up and
down the line, with members trusting that they can do so. You listen to
your foot soldiers. You want your meetings to be lively, with people not
overly concerned about bruising egos and causing offense; you want a
diversity of opinions. To allow for such openness, you must be careful

[PAGE 478]
in these discussions to not signal your own preference for a particular
option or decision, as this will subtly tip the team into following your
lead. Even bring in experts and outsiders to broaden the group’s
perspective.
The more expansive the deliberation process, the greater the
connection to reality, and the better your decisions. Of course, you can
take too much time in this process, but most people sin in the opposite
direction, making hurried decisions on highly filtered information. You
also want to establish as much transparency as possible: when
decisions are made, you share with the team how they came about and
for what purpose.
Extend this open communication to the ability for the group to
criticize itself and its performance, particularly after any mistakes or
failures. Try to turn this into a positive and lively experience, with the
focus not on scapegoats but on the overall functioning of the group,
which was not up to par. You want the group to keep learning and
improving. Learning from mistakes will make the team that much
more confident moving forward.
Infect the group with productive emotions. In the group setting, people
are naturally more emotional and permeable to the moods of others.
You must work with human nature and turn this into a positive by
infecting the group with the proper set of emotions. People are more
susceptible to the moods and attitudes of the leader than of anyone
else. Productive emotions would include calmness. Phil Jackson, the
most successful basketball coach in history, noticed that a lot of other
coaches would try to rev up the team before a game, get them excited
and even angry. He found it much more productive to instill a sense of
calmness that helped the players execute the game plan and not
overreact to the ups and downs in the game. As part of this strategy,
always keep the group focused on completing concrete tasks, which
will naturally ground and calm them.
Infect the group with a sense of resolution that emanates from you.
You are not upset by setbacks; you keep advancing and working on
problems. You are persistent. The group senses this, and individuals
feel embarrassed for becoming hysterical over the slightest shift in
fortune. You can try to infect the group with confidence, but be careful
that this does not slip into grandiosity. Your confidence and that of the
group mostly stems from a successful track record. Periodically change

[PAGE 479]
up routines, surprise the group with something new or challenging.
This will wake them up and stir them out of the complacency that can
settle into any group that achieves success.
Most important, showing a lack of fear and an overall openness to
new ideas will have the most therapeutic effect of all. The members will
become less defensive, which encourages them to think more on their
own, and not operate as automatons.
Forge a battle-tested group. It is essential that you know your group
well, its strengths and weaknesses and the maximum you can expect of
it. But appearances can be deceiving. In their day-to-day work, people
can seem motivated, connected, and productive. But add some stress
or pressure or even a crisis, and suddenly you see a whole other side of
them. Some begin to think more about themselves and disconnect
from the group spirit; others become far too anxious and infect the
group with their fears. Part of the reality you need to be on top of is the
actual strength of your team.
You want to be able to gauge the relative inner toughness of people
before you are thrust into a crisis. Give various members some
relatively challenging tasks or shorter deadlines than usual, and see
how they respond. Some people rise to the occasion and even do better
under such stress; consider such people a treasure to hoard. Lead the
team itself into an action that is novel and slightly riskier than usual.
Observe carefully how individuals react to the slight amount of chaos
and uncertainty that unfold from this. Of course, in the aftermath of
any crises or failures, use such moments as a way to review people’s
inner strength or lack of it. You can tolerate a few fearful types who
have other virtues, but not too many.
In the end, you want a group that has been through a few wars,
dealt with them reasonably well, and now is battle-tested. They do not
wilt at the sign of new obstacles and in fact welcome them. With such a
group, you can slowly expand the limits of what you can ask of them,
and the members feel a powerful upward pull to meet challenges and
prove themselves. Such a group can move mountains.

Finally, we like to focus on the psychological health of individuals, and
how perhaps a therapist could fix any problems they might have. What
we don’t consider, however, is that being in a dysfunctional group can
actually make individuals unstable and neurotic. The opposite is true
as well: by participating in a high-functioning reality group, we can
make ourselves healthy and whole. Such experiences are memorable
and life-changing. We learn the value of cooperating on a higher level,
of seeing our fate as intertwined with those around us. We develop
greater empathy. We gain confidence in our own abilities, which such a
group rewards. We feel connected to reality. We are brought into the
upward pull of the group, realizing our social nature on the high level it
was intended for. It is our duty as enlightened humans to create as
many such groups as possible, making society healthier in the process.
Madness is something rare in individuals—but in groups, parties, peoples,
and ages it is the rule.

Make Them Want to Follow You
The Law of Fickleness
Although styles of leadership change with the times, one constant
remains: people are always ambivalent about those in power.
They want to be led but also to feel free; they want to be protected
and enjoy prosperity without making sacrifices; they both worship
the king and want to kill him. When you are the leader of a group,
people are continually prepared to turn on you the moment you seem
weak or experience a setback. Do not succumb to the prejudices of the
times, imagining that what you need to do to gain their loyalty is to
seem to be their equal or their friend; people will doubt your strength,
become suspicious of your motives, and respond with hidden
contempt. Authority is the delicate art of creating the appearance of
power, legitimacy, and fairness while getting people to identify with
you as a leader who is in their service. If you want to lead, you must
master this art from early on in your life. Once you have gained
people’s trust, they will stand by you as their leader, no matter the
bad circumstances.
The Entitlement Curse
On the morning of Saturday, January 14, 1559, English people of all
ages and classes began gathering in the streets of London. It was the
day before the coronation of their new ruler, the twenty-five-year-old
Elizabeth Tudor, to be known as Queen Elizabeth I. By tradition, the
new monarch always led a ceremonial procession through the city. For
most, it would be the first time they had ever seen Elizabeth.
Some in the crowd were anxious—England was in bad financial
shape, the government heavily in debt; beggars were everywhere in the

[PAGE 482]
streets of large cities, and thieves roamed the countryside. Worst of all,
the country had just been through a virtual civil war between Catholics
and Protestants. Elizabeth’s father, Henry VIII (1491–1547), had
created the Church of England and had moved to transform England
into a Protestant country. The daughter from Henry’s first marriage
became Queen Mary I in 1553, and she tried to return England to the
Catholic fold, initiating a kind of English inquisition and earning the
nickname “Bloody Mary.” After Mary’s death in late 1558, Elizabeth
was next in line to succeed her, but was this the time for England to be
ruled by a woman who was so young and inexperienced?
Others were cautiously hopeful: like the majority of the English,
Elizabeth was a solid Protestant and would return the country to the
Church of England. But optimistic or pessimistic, no one on either side
really knew much about her. After Henry VIII had Elizabeth’s mother
and his second wife, Anne Boleyn, executed on trumped-up charges
when Elizabeth was not yet three, Elizabeth had been shunted from
stepmother to stepmother, and her presence within the court had been
minimal. The English people knew that her childhood had been
difficult and that Queen Mary had detested her, even throwing
Elizabeth into the Tower of London in 1554. (She had wanted to have
Elizabeth executed on charges of conspiring against the Crown but
could not gather enough evidence.) How had these experiences
affected the young Elizabeth? Was she as impetuous as her father or as
arrogant as her half-sister, Mary? With so much at stake, they were
beyond curious to know more about her.
For the English, the procession was a day for celebration and
merriment, and Elizabeth did not disappoint on that score. It was quite
a spectacle—colorful tapestries on the exterior walls of houses, banners
and streamers from every window, musicians and jesters roaming the
streets entertaining the crowd.
As a light snow fell, the queen-to-be herself now appeared on the
streets, and wherever she passed the crowd grew hushed. Carried in an
open litter, she wore the most beautiful golden royal robe and the most
magnificent jewels. She had a charming face and the liveliest dark eyes.
But as the procession moved along and various pageants were
performed for her benefit, the English saw something they had never
witnessed before or could even begin to imagine: the queen seemed to
enjoy mingling with the crowds, tears filling her eyes as she listened

[PAGE 483]
attentively to the poorest of Londoners with their petitions and
blessings for her reign.
When she talked, her manner of speaking was natural and even a
bit folksy. She fed off the growing excitement in the crowd, and her
affection for the people in the streets was all too apparent. One older
and quite poor woman handed her a withered sprig of rosemary for
good luck, and Elizabeth clutched it the entire day.
One witness wrote of Elizabeth, “If ever any person had either the
gift or the style to win the hearts of people, it was this Queen. . . . All
her faculties were in motion, and every motion seemed a well-guided
action: her eye was set upon one, her ear listened to another, her
judgment ran upon a third, to a fourth she addressed her speech; her
spirit seemed to be everywhere, and yet so entire in herself as it
seemed to be nowhere else. Some she pitied, some she commended,
some she thanked, at others she pleasantly and wittily jested . . . and
distributing her smiles, looks, and graces . . . that thereupon the people
again redoubled the testimony of their joys, and afterwards, raising
everything to the highest strain, filled the ears of all men with
immoderate extolling of their Prince.”
That night the city of London was abuzz with stories of the day. In
taverns and homes, people commented on Elizabeth’s strange and
electrifying presence. Kings and queens would often appear before the
public, but they were surrounded with such pomp and eager to
maintain their distance. They expected the people to obey and worship
them. But Elizabeth seemed eager to win the people’s love, and it had
charmed everyone who had seen her that day. As word spread of this
throughout the country, affection for their new queen began to swell
among the English, and they entertained some hope for the new reign.
—
Before her coronation, Elizabeth had made it known to Sir William
Cecil that she would choose him as her most trusted minister. Cecil,
thirteen years older than the queen, had served as an important
councillor under Edward VI, Elizabeth’s half-brother, who had ruled
after the death of Henry VIII in 1547 from age nine until his death at
age fifteen. Cecil had known Elizabeth since she was fourteen; they
shared similar intellectual interests and were both solid Protestants;

[PAGE 484]
they had many lively conversations and a friendly rapport. For his part,
Cecil understood her well. She was extremely intelligent, was very well
read, and spoke many languages fluently. They would often play chess,
and he was impressed with her patient style and how she often laid
elaborate traps for his pieces.
He knew that Elizabeth had been schooled in hardship. She had lost
not only her mother when she was so young but also her most beloved
stepmother, Catherine Howard, when she was eight. Catherine was
Henry’s fifth wife and a cousin of Anne Boleyn. Henry had had her
beheaded on trumped-up charges of adultery. Cecil also knew that the
few months Elizabeth had spent in the Tower of London had had a
traumatic effect on her, since she had expected to be executed at any
moment. She had emerged from all of these experiences as a
remarkably affable young woman, but Cecil knew that behind the
exterior she was willful, temperamental, and even devious.
Cecil was also certain about one more thing: ruling was not for
women. Queen Mary I had been England’s first true female ruler, and
she had proven to be a disaster. All the government ministers and
administrators were men, and a woman could not stand up to the
rough-and-tumble of dealing with them, and with male foreign
diplomats. Women were too emotional and unsteady. Elizabeth might
have a very capable mind, but she did not have the resilience for the
job. And so Cecil had formed a plan: Slowly he and his cohorts would
take over the reins, the queen advising but mostly following her
ministers’ guidance. And as quickly as possible they would get her
married, preferably to a Protestant, and her husband would take over
and rule as the king.
Almost from the beginning of her reign, however, Cecil realized that
his plan would not be so easy to enact. The queen was headstrong and
had plans of her own. In one way, he could not help but be impressed.
Her first day on the job, she held a meeting and made it clear to her
future councillors that she knew more than they did about the financial
state of the country; she was determined to make the government
solvent. She appointed Cecil as her secretary of state, and she began
meeting with him several times a day, giving him no spare hour to rest.
Unlike her father, who had let his ministers run things so he could
devote himself to hunting and pursuing young women, Elizabeth was
completely hands-on; Cecil was astounded at how many hours she put

[PAGE 485]
into the job, working well past midnight. She was exacting in what she
expected from him and the other ministers, and occasionally she could
be quite intimidating. If he pleased her with what he said or did, the
queen was all smiles and a touch coquettish. But if something turned
out wrong or if he disagreed too vociferously, she would shut him out
for days, and he would return home to stew in his anxiety. Had he lost
her trust? On occasion, she looked at him harshly or even upbraided
him in the thunderous style of her father. No, the queen would not be
easy to manage, and slowly he found himself working harder than ever
to impress her.
As part of his plan for the men to slowly take over power, he made
sure that all correspondence from foreign governments would be first
routed to his desk. He would keep the queen in the dark on several
important matters. Then he discovered that the queen had learned of
this and behind his back had ordered all diplomatic correspondence to
go through her. It was like a chess game, and she was playing several
moves ahead. He got angry and accused her of undermining him in his
work, but she stood her ground and had a very logical response: unlike
Cecil, she spoke and read all of the major European languages and
understood their nuances, and it would be better for all if she
personally conducted diplomacy and brought the ministers up to date
on foreign affairs. It was useless to argue, and he soon realized that
when it came to handling such correspondence and meetings with
diplomats, Elizabeth was a master negotiator.
Slowly his resistance wore down. Elizabeth would remain in charge,
at least for the first few years of her reign. But then she would marry
and produce the necessary heir for England, and her husband would
take over. It was unnatural for her to continue in this role as an unwed
ruler. It was rumored that she had confided in several friends that she
would never marry, and that she had an overwhelming fear of marriage
based on what she had seen with her father. But Cecil could not take
this seriously. She kept telling everyone that all that mattered was the
greater good of England, but to keep England without an heir apparent
was to risk a future civil war. Surely she could see the logic in this.
His goal was simple: to get the queen to agree to marry a foreign
prince in order to forge an alliance that would benefit England in its
weakened state. Preferably this would be a Protestant prince, but as
long as he was not a Catholic fanatic, Cecil would approve the choice.
The French were dangling before her a marriage with their fourteen-

[PAGE 486]
year-old king, Charles IX, and the Habsburgs were promoting a
marriage with Archduke Charles of Austria. Cecil’s great fear was that
she would marry the one man whom she had actually fallen in love
with, Robert Dudley, the Earl of Leicester, a man beneath her in
station who would stir up all kinds of dissension and intrigue within
the English court.
As representatives of different countries pressed their cases,
Elizabeth would seem to favor one, then grow cold. If the Spanish were
suddenly creating trouble on the Continent, she would begin marriage
negotiations with the French to make King Philip II of Spain suddenly
fear a French-English alliance and back off, or with Archduke Charles
of Austria to strike fear in both the French and Spanish. Year after year
she played this game. She confessed to Cecil she had no desire to be a
wife, but when Parliament threatened to cut off funds if she did not
promise to marry, Elizabeth would soften and negotiate with one of her
suitors. Then, once the funds from Parliament had been secured, she
would find some other excuse to break off the marriage talk—the
prince or king or archduke was too young, too fervently Catholic, not
her type, too effeminate, on and on. Not even Dudley could break her
resolve and get her to marry him.
After a few years of this, his frustration mounting, Cecil finally saw
through the game. There was nothing he could do, but at the same time
he had come to realize that Queen Elizabeth I was almost certainly a
more capable ruler than any of the foreign matches. She was so frugal
with expenses that the government was no longer in debt. As Spain
and France ruined themselves with endless wars, Elizabeth prudently
kept England out of the conflicts, and soon the country was prospering.
Although she was Protestant, she treated the English Catholics well,
and the bitter feelings from the religious wars a decade before were
now mostly gone. “There was never so wise a woman born as Queen
Elizabeth,” he would later write, and so he eventually dropped the
marriage issue, and the country itself slowly became used to the idea of
the Virgin Queen, married to her subjects.
Over the years, however, one issue would continue to eat away at
the people’s affection for the queen, and even made Cecil begin to
doubt her competence: the fate of Mary, Queen of Scots, cousin to
Elizabeth. Mary was a staunch Catholic, while Scotland had become
largely Protestant. Mary was next in line to be Queen of England, and
many Catholics asserted that Mary was in fact the rightful queen. The

[PAGE 487]
Scots themselves came to despise Mary for her religious sentiments,
for her adulterous affairs, and for her apparent implication in the
murder of her husband, Lord Darnley. In 1567 she was forced to
abdicate the Scottish throne in favor of her infant son, James VI. The
following year she escaped imprisonment in Scotland and fled to
England, putting herself in the hands of her cousin.
Elizabeth had every reason to despise Mary and return her to
Scotland. She was the polar opposite of Elizabeth—selfish, flighty, and
immoral. She was a fervent Catholic, and around her she would attract
all those in England and abroad who wanted to depose Elizabeth and
put a Catholic on the throne. She could not be trusted. But to the
dismay of Cecil, her councillors, and the English people, Elizabeth
allowed Mary to stay in the country under a mild form of house arrest.
Politically this seemed to make no sense. It infuriated the Scots and
threatened relations between the two countries.
As Mary began to secretly conspire against Elizabeth, and calls
arose from all sides to have her executed for treason, inexplicably
Elizabeth refused to take what appeared to be the rational step. Was it
simply a case of one Tudor protecting another? Did she fear the
precedent of executing a queen, and what it might mean for her own
fate? In any event, it made her look weak and selfish, as if what
mattered were protecting a fellow queen.
Then, in 1586, Mary became involved with the most audacious plot
to have Elizabeth murdered, upon which Mary would have become
Queen of England. She had secret backing from the pope and the
Spanish, and there was now incontrovertible proof of her involvement
in the plot. This outraged the public, who could well imagine the
bloody civil war that would have ensued if the plot had gone forward.
This time the pressure on Elizabeth was too great—no matter if Mary
had been a queen, she had to be executed. But yet again Elizabeth
hesitated.
A trial convicted Mary, but Elizabeth could not bring herself to sign
the death warrant. To Cecil and those in the court who saw her daily,
the queen had never appeared so distraught. Finally, in February of the
next year, she caved to the pressure and signed the death warrant.
Mary was beheaded the next day. The country erupted in celebration;
Cecil and his fellow ministers breathed a sigh of relief. There would be
no more conspiracies against Elizabeth, which would make the lack of

[PAGE 488]
an heir easier to bear. Despite her apparent mishandling of the
situation, the English people quickly forgave her. She had proven that
she could put the welfare of the country over personal considerations,
and her reluctance only made the final decision seem all the more
heroic.
—
King Philip II of Spain had known Elizabeth for many years, having
been married to her half-sister, Queen Mary I. When Mary had
imprisoned Elizabeth in the Tower of London, Philip had managed to
soften her stance and get Elizabeth released. He found the young
Elizabeth quite charming, and he admired her intelligence. But over
the years he began to dread and despise her. She was the main obstacle
to his goal of reestablishing the dominance of Catholicism, and he
would have to humble her. In his mind, she was not the legitimate
Queen of England. He began sneaking Jesuit priests into England to
spread the Catholic faith and secretly foment rebellion. He built up his
navy and stealthily prepared for what was known as the Enterprise of
England, a massive invasion that would overwhelm the island and
restore it to Catholicism. The execution of Mary, Queen of Scots, was
the final straw—it was time for the invasion.
Philip felt supremely confident in the success of the Enterprise.
Over the years, he had taken the measure of his great rival. She was
crafty and clever, but she had one overwhelming disadvantage—she
was a woman. As such, she was unsuited to lead a war. In fact, she
seemed to be afraid of armed conflict, always negotiating and finding
ways to avoid it. She had never paid much attention to her military.
The English navy was relatively small, its ships not nearly as large and
powerful as the great Spanish galleons. England’s army was quite
pitiful compared with Spain’s. And Philip had the gold from the New
World to help finance the effort.
He planned for the invasion to take place in the summer of 1587,
but that year Sir Francis Drake raided the Spanish coast and destroyed
many of its ships in the harbor of Cádiz, while seizing great treasures of
gold. Philip postponed the invasion to the following year, the costs
slowly mounting for maintaining his army and building more galleons.

[PAGE 489]
Philip had overseen every detail of the invasion. He would launch
an invincible armada of some 130 ships, manned by over thirty
thousand men. They would easily destroy the English navy, link up
with a large Spanish force in the Netherlands, cross the Channel, and
sweep their way to London, where they would capture the Queen and
put her on trial for the execution of Mary Queen of Scots; he would
then put his own daughter on the throne of England.
Finally, the armada was launched in May of 1588, and by July the
Spanish fleet was maneuvering around the southwestern coast of
England. The Spanish galleons had perfected a certain form of warfare:
they were so large they would maneuver close to the enemy ships,
grapple, and board them with a virtual army. But they had never done
battle with the much smaller and faster English ships, with their long-
range cannons, and in waters much rougher than the Mediterranean.
They did not do well.
On July 27, the armada anchored at Calais, just a few miles from
where the Spanish army awaited them. In the middle of the night, the
English sent five unmanned “fireships”—loaded with flaming wood
and pitch—toward the anchored galleons. With the high winds that
evening, the fire spread quickly from ship to ship. The Spanish
galleons tried to regroup farther out to sea, but their formation was
loose and scattered, and the fast English ships fired at them like ducks
in the water. As the winds changed again, the Spanish were forced to
retreat northward, into the stormiest parts of the North Sea. Trying to
round England and retreat to Spain, they lost most of their ships and
over twenty thousand Spanish soldiers died. The English had lost no
ships and had only around a hundred casualties. It was one of the most
lopsided victories in military history.
For Philip, it was the most humiliating moment in his life. He
retired into his palace, where he holed himself up for months
contemplating the disaster. The armada had left Spain utterly
bankrupt, and in the years to come England would prosper while Spain
became the second-rate power. Somehow Elizabeth had outwitted him.
To the other leaders in Europe who hated her, she now seemed
invincible and a ruler to be feared. Pope Sixtus V, who had
excommunicated her and had given his blessing to the armada, now
exclaimed, “Just look how well she governs! She is only a woman, only
mistress of half an island, and yet she makes herself feared by Spain,
by France, by the Empire, by all!”

[PAGE 490]
—
Now in England there arose a veritable cult around the Virgin Queen.
She was now referred to as “Her Sacred Majesty.” To catch a glimpse of
her riding through London or passing on her barge on the Thames
seemed like a religious experience.
One group, however, proved less susceptible to this powerful aura—
the new generation of young men now filling the royal court. To them,
the queen was showing her age. They respected her accomplishments,
but they saw her more as a domineering mother figure. England was a
rising power. These young men yearned to make a name for
themselves on the battlefield and so earn public acclaim. Yet Elizabeth
continually thwarted this desire. She refused to finance a large-scale
campaign to finish off Philip, or to aid the French in their fight against
the Spanish. They saw her as tired and felt it was time for their
spirited, masculine generation to lead England. And the young man
who came to epitomize this new spirit was Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl
of Essex.
Born in 1566, Essex was handsome and high-strung. He knew the
queen had a weakness for young men, and he quickly charmed her,
becoming her new favorite. He genuinely liked and admired her, but at
the same time he resented the power she possessed over his fate. He
began to test her: he asked for favors, mostly money. She gave these to
him. She seemed to enjoy spoiling him. And as the relationship
progressed, Essex began to see her as a woman he could manipulate.
He started to criticize her rather boldly in front of other courtiers, and
the queen let him get away with it. She drew a line, however, when he
asked for high political positions for himself and his friends, and then
he would fly into a rage. It was humiliating to depend on the whims of
a woman! But days later he would calm down and return to his charm
offensive.
Kept away from political power, he saw that his only chance for
fame and glory was to lead an English army to victory. Elizabeth
allowed him to lead some smaller military expeditions on the
Continent. His record was mixed—he was brave but not very good at
strategy. Then, in 1596, he persuaded her to let him lead a Drake-like
raid on the Spanish coast. This time his boldness paid off, and the

[PAGE 491]
campaign was a success. To the English people, now somewhat drunk
on their new status as a European power, Essex represented their new
swagger, and he became their darling. Essex wanted more of this and
kept asking the queen for another chance in battle. He attributed her
reluctance to the many enemies he had made in the court, men who
envied him.
In 1598 news reached the court that a band of Irish rebels under
Hugh O’Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone, was moving through English-
controlled territory in Ireland and wreaking havoc. Now Essex offered
his services to lead a force to crush Tyrone. He pleaded and persisted,
and Elizabeth finally relented. Feeling confident of his powers over the
queen, he requested for the campaign the largest army yet assembled
by the English. Elizabeth granted his wish. For the first time, he felt
truly appreciated by her. She did have a strange ability to make him
want to please her. He expressed his gratitude and promised to finish
the job quickly. Ireland would be the means for him to rise to the top.
Once he was there, however, the troubles mounted. It was the
winter of 1599; the weather was awful and the terrain hopelessly
boggy. He could not advance his enormous force. The Irish were
elusive and masters at guerrilla warfare. While the English remained
hobbled in their camps, thousands of soldiers died from disease and
just as many began to desert. Essex could only imagine his many
enemies at court talking behind his back. He felt certain the queen and
several ministers were somehow plotting his downfall.
He had to test her again—he asked for reinforcements. The queen
agreed, but she ordered him to finally find and fight Tyrone. Suddenly
the pressure was too much, and he blamed the queen and her envious
courtiers for trying to rush him. He felt humiliated by the position he
was in, and by the end of the summer he had decided upon a plan that
would put an end once and for all to his misery—he would secretly
negotiate a truce with Tyrone, then return to England and march on
London with his troops. He would force the queen to get rid of his
enemies within the court and secure his position as her lead councillor.
He would be forceful but respectful of her position; seeing him in
person and with his troops, the queen would certainly relent.
After a swift march through England, he suddenly showed up one
morning in her bedchamber, his uniform caked in mud. The queen,
caught by surprise and not knowing if he had come to arrest her and

[PAGE 492]
launch a coup, retained her composure. She offered him her hand to
kiss and told him they would talk of Ireland later that day. Her
calmness discomfited him; it was not what he had expected. She
possessed a strange kind of power over him. Somehow the tables had
been turned, and now he agreed to postpone their talk to the
afternoon. Within hours, he found himself taken by her soldiers and
placed under house arrest.
Counting on his influence over the queen and how often she had
forgiven him, he wrote her letter after letter, apologizing for his
actions. She did not respond. This had never happened before, and it
frightened him. Finally, in August of 1600, she freed him. Grateful for
this and plotting his comeback, he asked just one favor—to restore to
him the monopoly he had possessed over the sale of sweet wines in
England; he was hopelessly in debt and this was his principal source of
income. Much to his chagrin, she refused to honor his request. She was
playing some game, trying to teach him a lesson or tame him, but that
would never happen. She had pushed him too far.
He retired to his house in London and gathered around him all of
the disgruntled noblemen in England. Together he would lead them on
a march to the queen’s residence and take over the country. He
predicted that thousands of Englishmen, who still adored him, would
rally to his cause and swell the ranks of his troops. In early February
1601, he finally put his plan into action. To his utter dismay,
Londoners stayed in their houses and ignored him. Sensing the
foolhardiness of the venture, his fellow soldiers quickly deserted.
Virtually alone, he retreated to his house. He knew this was the end for
him, but at least he would remain defiant.
That afternoon, soldiers came to arrest Essex. Elizabeth arranged
for a quick trial, and Essex was found guilty of treason. This time
Elizabeth did not hesitate to sign the death warrant. During his trial,
Essex maintained the most insolent air. He would go to his death
denying his guilt and refusing to ask forgiveness.
The night before he was to be beheaded, the queen sent her own
chaplain to prepare him for the end. Confronted with this
representative of Elizabeth, who relayed her last words to him, Essex
broke down. All those moments in which he had sensed her authority
but had tried to resist its power, including that morning in her
bedchamber when she had stood before him so regal and self-

[PAGE 493]
possessed, suddenly overwhelmed him. He confessed his crimes to the
chaplain. In his mind, he mixed the image of his imminent judgment
before God with the majesty of the queen, and he felt the full weight of
his betrayal. He could see her face before him, and it frightened him.
He told the chaplain, “I must confess to you that I am the greatest,
the vilest, and most unthankful traitor that ever has been in the land.”
The queen was right to execute him, he said. He requested a private
execution so as not to inflame the public. In his last words, he asked
God to preserve the queen. He went to his death with a submissiveness
and quiet dignity that no one had seen or suspected in him before.

Interpretation: When Elizabeth Tudor became queen, she
understood her supremely fragile position. Unlike her father or almost
any other English monarch, she had zero credibility as a ruler, and no
respect or authority to draw upon. The country was in a weakened
state. She was too young, with no political experience or prior
proximity to power to learn from. Yes, by merely occupying the throne
she could expect some obedience, but such loyalty was thin and could
change with the slightest mistake or crisis. And within months or years
she would be forced to marry, and as she knew, being married could
lead to all sorts of problems if she did not quickly produce a male heir.
What made this even more troubling was that Elizabeth was
ambitious and highly intelligent; she felt more than capable of ruling
England. She had a vision of how she could solve its many problems
and transform it into a European power. Marriage would not only be
bad for her but for the country as well. Most likely she would have to
marry a foreign prince, whose allegiance would be to his country of
origin. He would use England as a pawn in the Continent’s power
games and drain its resources even further. But given all the odds
against her, how could she hope to rule England on her own? She
decided the only way forward was to turn her weak position into an
advantage, forging her own type of credibility and authority, one that
in the end would give her powers far greater than any previous king.
Her plan was based on the following logic: Kings and queens of her
time ruled with a tremendous sense of entitlement due to their
bloodline and semidivine status. They expected complete obedience
and loyalty. They did not have to do anything to earn this; it came with

[PAGE 494]
the position. But this sense of entitlement had its consequences. Their
subjects would pay homage, but the emotional connection to such
rulers was in most cases not very deep. The English people could feel
the distance separating themselves from the monarch, and how little
their rulers really considered them.
This feeling of entitlement also blunted their political effectiveness.
The government ministers were cowed and intimidated by someone
like Henry VIII, and so their energy went into appeasing the king
rather than using their own intelligence and creative powers. With this
sense of entitlement, rulers paid less attention to the details of
governing, which were too boring; wars of conquest became their chief
means of getting glory and providing riches for the aristocracy, even
though such wars drained a country’s resources. These rulers could be
incredibly selfish—Henry VIII had Elizabeth’s mother executed so he
could marry his latest mistress, not caring how tyrannical this made
him seem to the English. Mary, Queen of Scots, had her husband
murdered so she could marry her lover.
It would be easy for Elizabeth to delude herself and simply expect
the loyalty that came with her august position. But she was too smart
to fall into that trap. She would deliberately go in the opposite
direction. She would feel no sense of entitlement. She would keep in
mind the weakness of her actual position. She would not passively
expect loyalty; she would turn active. She would earn the trust and
credibility she required through her actions over time. She would
demonstrate that she was not selfish, that everything she did was
motivated by what was for the greater good of the country. She would
be alert and relentless in this task. She would alter the way people (her
subjects, her ministers, her foreign rivals) perceived her—from an
inexperienced and weak woman to a figure of authority and great
power. By forging much deeper ties with her ministers and the
commoners, she would overcome people’s natural fickleness and
channel their energies for the purpose of rebuilding England.
Her first appearances before the English people were cleverly
crafted to set the stage for a new type of leadership. Surrounded by all
the usual royal pomp, she mixed in a common touch, making her seem
both comforting and regal. She was not faking this. Having felt
powerless in her youth, she could identify with the poorest charwoman
of England. She indicated through her attitude that she was on their
side, sensitive to their opinions of her. She wanted to earn their

[PAGE 495]
approval. She would build on this empathy throughout her reign, and
the bonds between her and subjects became much more intense than
with any previous ruler.
With her ministers, the task was more delicate and difficult. It was a
group of power-hungry men, with their egos and need to feel smarter
than and superior to a woman. She depended on their help and
goodwill to run the country, but if she revealed too much dependence
on them, they would walk all over her. And so, from the first days of
her rule, she made the following clear: she was all business; she would
work harder than all of them; she would reduce expenditures for the
court, sacrificing her own income in the process; and all activity was to
be directed toward lifting England out of the hole it had fallen into. She
showed early on her superior knowledge of the finances of the country
and the tough side of herself in any negotiation. Upon occasion, she
would flash her anger if a minister seemed to be furthering a personal
agenda, and such outbursts could be quite intimidating.
Mostly, though, she was warm and empathetic, attuned to the
various moods of these men. Soon they wanted to please her and win
her approval. To not work hard or smart enough could mean isolation
and some coldness, and unconsciously they wanted to avoid this. They
respected the fact that she lived up to her own high standards. In this
way, she slowly placed these ministers into the same position that she
had found herself in: needing to gain her trust and respect through
their actions. Now, instead of a cabal of conspiring, selfish ministers,
the queen had a team working to further her agenda, and the results
soon spoke for themselves.
By these methods, Elizabeth acquired the credibility she needed,
but she made one major mistake—her handling of Mary, Queen of
Scots. Elizabeth had become somewhat entitled herself, feeling in this
case that she knew better than her ministers and that her personal
qualms about executing a fellow queen trumped everything else. She
paid a price for this policy, as she felt the people’s respect for her
draining away, and it pained her. Her sense of the greater good was
what guided her, but in this case the greater good would be served by
having Mary executed. She was violating her own principles.
It took some time, but she realized her mistake. She tasked the head
of her secret service to lure Mary into her most far-reaching conspiracy
to get rid of Elizabeth. Now with solid evidence of Mary’s complicity,

[PAGE 496]
Elizabeth could take the dreaded step. In the end, going against her
own feelings for the sake of the country, in essence admitting her
mistake, gained her even more trust from the English. It was the kind
of response to public opinion that almost no rulers of the time were
capable of.
When it came to her foreign rivals, particularly Philip II, Elizabeth
was not naive and understood the situation: Nothing she had done had
earned her any respect or respite from their endless conspiracies to get
rid of her. They disrespected her as an unmarried queen and as a
woman who seemed to fear conflict and warfare. She largely ignored
all of this and kept to her mission of securing England’s finances. But
when the invasion of England seemed imminent, she knew it was time
to finally prove herself as the great strategist that she was. She would
play on Philip’s underestimating of her craftiness and her toughness as
a leader.
If war was necessary, she would do it as economically and efficiently
as possible. She invested large sums in creating the most elaborate spy
system in Europe, which allowed her to know in advance Spain’s plans
for the invasion, including the date of the launch. With such
knowledge, she could commission and pay for an army at the last
minute, saving huge sums of money. She financed Sir Frances Drake’s
raids on the coast of Spain and its galleons at sea. This allowed her to
enrich England’s coffers and delay the launching of the armada, which
made it all the more expensive for Philip.
When it seemed certain the launch would occur within a few
months, she quickly built up the English navy, commissioning smaller
and faster ships, cheaper to build in bulk and well suited to the English
seas. Unlike Philip, she left battle strategy in the hands of her admirals,
but she overruled them on one score—she wanted them to fight the
armada as close to England as possible. This would play into English
hands, as the Spanish galleons were not suited for the stormy northern
seas, and the English soldiers, fighting with their backs to their
country, would fight all the harder. In the end, Spain was bankrupted
and never to return to her former glory, while England under Elizabeth
was now the rising power. But after this great victory, she resisted the
calls to take the battle to Spain and deal the country a fatal blow. She
was not interested in war for glory or conquest but only to safeguard
the country’s interests.

[PAGE 497]
After the defeat of the armada, her authority and credibility seemed
invulnerable, but Elizabeth would never let her guard down. She knew
that with age and success would naturally come that dreaded sense of
entitlement and the insensitivity that went with it. As a woman ruling
the country by herself, she could not afford such a letdown. She
retained her receptiveness to the moods of those around her, and she
could sense that the younger men now filling the court had a much
different attitude toward her. Their respect was for her position as
queen, but it did not run much deeper than that. Once again she would
have to struggle against masculine egos, but this time without her own
youthful charms and coquetry to fall back on.
Her goal with Essex was to tame and channel his spirit for the good
of the country, as she had done with her ministers. She indulged him
in his endless desires for money and perks, trying to calm his
insecurities, but when it came to giving him any political power, she set
limits. He had to prove himself, to rise to her level, before she would
grant him such powers. When he threw tantrums, she remained calm
and steady, unconsciously proving to him her superiority and the need
for self-control. When it became clear he could not be tamed, she let
him go far enough with his conspiring to ruin his reputation and allow
her to get rid of this cancer. And when he faced death for his crime, it
was not simply the image of God that terrified him but that of the
queen, whose aura of authority finally overwhelmed this most insolent
and self-entitled of men.
Understand: Although there are no longer powerful kings and
queens in our midst, more of us than ever operate as if we consider
ourselves royalty. We feel entitled to respect for our work, no matter
how little we have actually accomplished. We feel people should take
our ideas and projects seriously, no matter how little thought went into
them or how meager our track record. We expect people to help us in
our careers, because we are sincere and have the best intentions. Some
of this modern form of entitlement might come from being especially
spoiled by our parents, who made us feel that anything we did was
golden. Some of it might come from the technology that so dominates
our lives and spoils us as well. It gives us immense powers without our
having to exert any real effort. We have come to take such powers for
granted and expect everything in life to be so fast and easy.
Whatever the cause, it infects all of us, and we must see this sense of
entitlement as a curse. It makes us ignore the reality—people have no

[PAGE 498]
inherent reason to trust or respect us just because of who we are. It
makes us lazy and contented with the slightest idea or the first draft of
our work. Why do we have to raise our game or strain to improve
ourselves when we feel we are already so great? It makes us insensitive
and self-absorbed. By feeling that others owe us trust and respect, we
negate their willpower, their ability to judge for themselves, and this is
infuriating. We may not see it, but we inspire resentment.
And if we become leaders or subleaders, the effect of this curse only
gets worse. Unconsciously, we tend to sit back and expect people to
come to us with their loyalty and respect for the high position we
occupy. We grow defensive and prickly if our ideas are challenged,
putting our intelligence and wisdom into question, even on the
smallest of matters. We expect certain perks and privileges, and if
there are sacrifices to be made, we somehow feel we should be
exempted. If we make a mistake, it is always the fault of someone else,
or circumstances, or some momentary inner demon beyond our
control. We are never really to blame.
We are not aware of how this affects those whom we lead, because
we notice only people’s smiles and nods of approval at what we say.
But they see through us. They feel the entitlement we project, and over
time it diminishes their respect and disconnects them from our
influence. At a certain tipping point, they may turn against us with a
suddenness that is shocking.
Like Elizabeth, we must realize that we are actually in a weak
position, and we must struggle to adopt the opposite attitude: We
expect nothing from the people around us, from those whom we lead.
We are not defensive or sitting back but completely active—everything
we get from others, and most definitely their respect, must be earned.
We have to continually prove ourselves. We have to show that our
primary consideration is not ourselves and our sensitive egos but the
welfare of the group. We must be responsive and truly empathetic to
people’s moods, but with limits—to those who show themselves to be
mostly self-promoting, we are tough and merciless. We practice what
we preach, working harder than others, sacrificing our own interests if
necessary, and being accountable for any mistakes. We expect the
members of the group to follow our lead and prove themselves in
return.

[PAGE 499]
With such an attitude, we will notice a very different effect. People
will open themselves to our influence; as we move toward them, they
move toward us. They want to win our approval and respect. With such
an emotional connection, we are more easily forgiven for mistakes. The
group energy is not squandered on endless infighting and the clashing
of egos but is directed toward reaching goals and accomplishing great
things. And in achieving such results, we can forge an aura of authority
and power that only grows with time. What we say and do seems to
carry extra weight, and our reputation precedes us.
That . . . is the road to the obedience of compulsion. But there is a shorter
way to a nobler goal, the obedience of the will. When the interests of
mankind are at stake, they will obey with joy the man whom they believe to
be wiser than themselves. You may prove this on all sides: you may see how
the sick man will beg the doctor to tell him what he ought to do, how a
whole ship’s company will listen to the pilot.
—Xenophon
Keys to Human Nature
We humans like to believe that the emotions we experience are simple
and pure: we love certain people and hate others, we respect and
admire this individual and have nothing but disdain for another. The
truth is that this is almost never the case. It is a fundamental fact of
human nature that our emotions are almost always ambivalent,
rarely pure and simple. We can feel love and hostility at the same
time, or admiration and envy.
This ambivalence began in our childhood and set the pattern for the
rest of our lives. If our parents were relatively attentive and loving, we
remember our childhood fondly, as a golden period. What we
conveniently forget is that even with such parents we tended to feel
resentful of our dependence on their love and care. In some cases, we
felt smothered. We yearned to assert our willpower, to show we could
stand on our own. Feeling too dependent on their attention could open
up tremendous anxieties about our vulnerability if they were gone. And
so we inevitably felt some hostility and desire to disobey, along with
our affection.
If they were not kind and caring, later in life we resent them and
can remember only their coldness and our present antipathy. But we
forget that in our childhood we tended to gloss over their negative
traits and find ways to love them despite their treatment, and to

[PAGE 500]
somehow blame ourselves for not deserving their affection. Given the
fact that we depended on them for our survival, to feel they truly did
not care would have stirred up far too much anxiety. Mixed with
moments of anger and frustration were feelings of need and love.
And so as children, when one emotion dominated us, the other lay
underneath, a continual ambivalent undertone. As adults, we
experience similar ambivalence with our friends and intimate partners,
particularly if we feel dependent on them and vulnerable.
Part of the reason for this essential ambivalence is that strong, pure
emotions are frightening. They represent a momentary loss of control.
They seem to negate our willpower. We unconsciously balance them
with contrary or conflicting emotions. And part of it stems from the
fact that our moods are continually shifting and overlapping. Whatever
the cause, we are not aware of our own ambivalence because
contemplating the complexity of our emotions is baffling, and we
prefer to rely on simple explanations for who we are and what we are
feeling. We do the same with the people around us, reducing our
interpretations of their feelings to something simple and digestible. It
would take effort, and much honesty on our part, to catch our own
underlying ambivalence in action.
Nowhere is this fundamental aspect of human nature more evident
than in our relationship toward leaders, whom we unconsciously
associate with parental figures. This ambivalence toward leaders
operates in the following way.
On the one hand, we intuitively recognize the need for leaders. In
any group, people have their narrow agendas and competing interests.
The members feel insecure about their own position and work to
secure it. Without leaders who stand above these competing interests
and who see the larger picture, the group would be in trouble. Hard
decisions would never be made. No one would be guiding the ship.
Therefore, we crave leadership and unconsciously feel disoriented,
even hysterical, without someone fulfilling this role.
On the other hand, we also tend to fear and even despise those who
are above us. We fear that those in power will be tempted to use the
privileges of their position to accumulate more power and enrich
themselves, a common enough occurrence. We are also willful
creatures. We don’t feel comfortable with the inferiority and
dependence that comes with serving under a leader. We want to

[PAGE 501]
exercise our own will and feel our autonomy. We secretly envy the
recognition and privileges that leaders possess. This essential
ambivalence tips toward the negative when leaders show signs of
abuse, insensitivity, or incompetence. No matter how powerful the
leaders, no matter how much we might admire them, below the surface
sits this ambivalence, and it makes people’s loyalties notoriously fickle
and volatile.
Those in power will tend to notice only the smiles of their
employees and the applause they receive at meetings, and they will
mistake such support for reality. They do not realize that people almost
always show such deference to those above them, because their
personal fate is in the hands of such leaders and they cannot afford to
show their true feelings. And so leaders are rarely aware of the
underlying ambivalence that is there even when things are going well.
If leaders make some mistakes, or if their power seems shaky,
suddenly they will see the mistrust and loss of respect that had been
invisibly building up, as the members of the group or the public turn
on them with an intensity that is surprising and shocking. Look at the
news to see how quickly leaders in any field can lose support and
respect, and how quickly they are judged by their latest success or
failure.
We might be tempted to believe that such fickleness is more of a
modern phenomenon, a product of the fiercely democratic times we
live in. After all, our ancestors were much more obedient than we
moderns, or so we think. But this was hardly the case. Far back in time,
among indigenous cultures and early civilizations, once-revered chiefs
and kings were routinely put to death if they showed signs of aging or
weakness; or if they lost a battle; or if a sudden drought occurred,
meaning the gods no longer blessed them; or if they were seen as
favoring their own clan at the expense of the group. These executions
were moments of great celebration, a time to release all of the pent-up
hostility toward leaders. (See The Golden Bough, by James Frazer, for
innumerable examples of this.)
Perhaps unconsciously our ancestors feared any one individual
lasting long in power, because they sensed the corrupting aspect of
power; and with someone new and fresh, they could control him
better. In any case, underneath their obedience lay tremendous
wariness. We may not execute our chiefs anymore, but we do so
symbolically in our elections and in the media, taking joy in witnessing

[PAGE 502]
the ritualistic fall of the powerful. We may not blame them for a lack of
rainfall, but we will blame them for any downturn in the economy,
even though most of what happens in the economy is beyond their
control. As with the rainfall, they seem to have lost the blessings of
good fortune, of the gods. When it comes to our ambivalence and
mistrust, we have not changed as much as we think.
Throughout history, however, certain notable leaders have been
able to erect a bulwark against this volatility, to earn a type of solid
respect and support that allowed them to accomplish great things over
time. We think of Moses, or the ancient Indian emperor Asoka, or
Pericles (see chapter 1), or the Roman general Scipio Africanus, or
Queen Elizabeth I. In more modern times we can think of Abraham
Lincoln, or Martin Luther King Jr., or Warren Buffett, or Angela
Merkel, or Steve Jobs. We shall call such power authority, reverting to
the original significance of the word, which comes from the Latin
auctoritas, the root meaning “to increase or augment.”
To the ancient Romans, those who had founded their republic
possessed tremendous wisdom. Their ancestors had demonstrated this
wisdom by how strong and long-lasting were the institutions they had
established, and how they had transformed their provincial town into
the preeminent power in the known world. To the extent that Roman
senators and leaders returned to this basic wisdom and embodied the
ideals of the founders, they had authority—an augmented presence, an
increased prestige and credibility. Such leaders did not have to resort
to speeches or to force. Roman citizens willingly followed their lead
and accepted their ideas or advice. Their every word and deed seemed
to carry extra weight. This gave them greater leeway in making hard
decisions; they were not judged merely by their latest success.
The Romans were notoriously fractious and mistrustful of those in
power. Their politics could easily descend into civil war, which in fact
happened on several occasions. Having leaders who exuded authority
was a way to control this combativeness, to get things done, to
maintain a degree of unity. And it required that such leaders embody
the highest of ideals, ones that transcended the pettiness of daily
political life.
This Roman model, which represents an adherence to a higher
purpose, remains the essential ingredient for all true forms of

[PAGE 503]
authority. And this is how we must operate if we wish to establish such
authority in the world today.
First and foremost, we must understand the fundamental task of
any leader—to provide a far-reaching vision, to see the global picture,
to work for the greater good of the group and maintain its unity. That
is what people crave in their leaders. We have to avoid ever seeming
petty, self-serving, or indecisive. Showing signs of that will stir up the
ambivalence. Focusing on the future and the larger picture should
consume much of our thinking. Based on this vision, we must set
practical goals and guide the group toward them. We need to become
masters of this visionary process through practice and experience.
Attaining such mastery will give us tremendous confidence in
ourselves, as opposed to the fake confidence of those who are merely
grandiose. And when we exude this confidence, people will be drawn to
us and want to follow our lead.
At the same time, however, we must see leadership as a dynamic
relationship we have with those being led. We have to understand that
our slightest gesture has an unconscious effect on individuals. And so
we must pay great attention to our attitude, to the tone that we set. We
need to attune ourselves to the shifting moods of the members of the
group. We must never assume we have their support. Our empathy
must be visceral—we can feel when members are losing respect for us.
As part of the dynamic, we need to realize that when we show our
respect and trust toward those below us, such feelings will flow back to
us. The members will open up to our influence. We must try as much
as possible to engage people’s willpower, to make them identify with
the group’s mission, to want to actively participate in realizing our
higher purpose.
This empathy, however, must never mean becoming needlessly soft
and pliant to the group’s will. That will only signal weakness. When it
comes to our primary task—that of providing a vision for the group and
leading it toward the appropriate goals—we must be stern and
immovable. Yes, we can listen to the ideas of others and incorporate
the good ones. But we must keep in mind that we have a greater
command of the overall details and global picture. We must not
succumb to political pressures to seem fairer, and so dilute our vision.
This vision of ours is beyond politics. It represents truth and reality.
We have to be resilient and tough when it comes to realizing it, and
merciless with those who try to sabotage this vision or work against the

[PAGE 504]
greater good. Toughness and empathy are not incompatible, as Queen
Elizabeth I demonstrated.
When leaders fail to establish these twin pillars of authority—vision
and empathy—what often happens is the following: Those in the group
feel the disconnect and distance between them and leadership. They
know that deep down they are viewed as replaceable pawns. They
sense the overall lack of direction and the constant tactical reactions to
events. And so, in subtle ways, they begin to feel resentful and to lose
respect. They listen less attentively to what such leaders say. They
spend more hours in the day thinking of their own interests and future.
They join or form factions. They work at half or three-quarter speed.
If such leaders, sensing all of this, become more forceful and
demanding, the members become more passive-aggressive. If the
leaders become pliant and plead for more support, the members feel
even less respect, as if the group were now leading the leader. In this
way, the members create endless forms of friction for leaders, who
might now feel like they have to drag the group up a hill. This friction,
caused by their own inattentiveness, is why so many leaders get so
little done and are so mediocre.
On the other hand, if we intuitively or consciously follow the path of
establishing authority, as described above, we have a much different
effect on the group dynamic. The ambivalence of the members or the
public does not go away—that would violate human nature—but it
becomes manageable. People will still waver and have moments of
doubt or envy, but they will more quickly forgive us for any mistakes
and move past their suspicions. We have established enough trust for
that to happen. Besides, the members have come to dread what could
occur if we no longer were the leaders—the disunity, the lack of clarity,
the bad decisions. Their need for us is too strong.
Now we are no longer dealing with the invisible friction from the
group but the opposite. The members feel engaged in the larger
mission. We are able to channel their creative energy, instead of having
to drag them along. With this loyalty in place, it is easier to reach goals
and realize our vision. This gives us the augmented presence of
authority, in which everything we say and do has added weight.
It is always within our capacity to reach this ideal, and if the
members lose respect and trust in us, we must see this as our own
fault.

—
Your task as a student of human nature is threefold: First, you must
make yourself a consummate observer of the phenomenon of
authority, using as a measuring device the degree of influence people
wield without the use of force or motivational speeches. You begin this
process by looking at your own family and gauging which parent, if
any, exercised greater authority over you and your siblings. You look at
the teachers and mentors in your life, some of whom distinguished
themselves by the powerful effect they had on you. Their words and the
example they set still reverberate in your mind. You observe your own
bosses in action, looking at their effect not only on you and other
individuals but also on the group as a whole. Lastly, you look at the
various leaders in the news. In all these cases, you want to determine
the source of their authority or lack of it. You want to discern moments
when their authority waxes or wanes, and figure out why.
Second, you want to develop some of the habits and strategies (see
the next section) that will serve you well in projecting authority. If you
are an apprentice who aspires to a position of leadership, developing
these strategies early on will give you an impressive and appealing aura
in the present, making it seem as if you were destined to be powerful.
If you are already in a leadership position, these strategies will
strengthen your authority and connectedness to the group.
As part of this process, you need to reflect on the effect you have on
people: Are you constantly arguing, trying to impose your will, finding
much more resistance than you expect to your ideas and projects? Do
people nod as they listen to your advice and then do the opposite? If
you are just starting out, sometimes this cannot be helped—people
generally don’t respect the ideas of those lower down in the hierarchy;
the same ideas promulgated by a boss would have a different effect.
But sometimes it could stem from your own actions, as you violate
many of the principles described above.
Do not take people’s smiles and expressions of assent for reality.
Notice their tension as they do so; pay particular attention to their
actions. Take any grumbling as a reflection on your authority. In
general, you want to heighten your sensitivity to others, looking in
particular at those moments when you can feel people’s disrespect, or

[PAGE 506]
your authority on the wane. But keep in mind that there are always bad
apples within any group, people who will grumble and not be won over
by you no matter what you do. They live to be passive-aggressive and
undermine anyone in a leadership position. Don’t bother with
empathy; nothing will work on them. The art is to recognize them as
quickly as possible and either fire or marginalize them. Having a group
that is tight and committed will also make it much easier to control
such malevolent types.
Third and most important, you must not fall for the
counterproductive prejudices of the times we live in, in which the very
concept of authority is often misunderstood and despised. Today we
confuse authority with leaders in general, and since so many of them in
the world seem more interested in preserving their power and
enriching themselves, naturally we have doubts about the very concept
itself. We also live in fiercely democratic times. “Why should we ever
have to follow a person of authority, and assume such an inferior
role?” we might ask ourselves. “People in power should simply get the
job done; authority is a relic of kings and queens. We have progressed
far beyond that.”
This disdain for authority and leadership has filtered its way
throughout our culture. We no longer recognize authority in the arts.
Everyone is a legitimate critic, and standards should be personal—
nobody’s taste or judgment should be seen as superior. In the past,
parenting was considered the model of authority, but parents no
longer want to see themselves as authority figures whose role is to
inculcate children with particular values and culture. Instead, parents
like to see themselves more as equals, with a bit more knowledge and
experience, whose role is really to validate their children’s feelings and
make sure they are continually entertained and occupied. They are
more like older friends. This same leveling dynamic applies to teachers
and students, where learning must be fun.
In this atmosphere, leaders begin to believe that they are more like
caretakers, there to stand back and enable the group to make the right
decisions, doing everything by consensus. Or they entertain the idea
that what matters more than anything else is crunching numbers,
absorbing the mass of information available today. Data and
algorithms will determine the direction to take and are the real
authority.

[PAGE 507]
All of these ideas and values have unintended consequences.
Without authority in the arts, there is nothing to rebel against, no prior
movement to overturn, no deep thinking to assimilate and later even
reject. There is only an amorphous world of trends that flicker away
with increasing speed. Without parents as authority figures, we cannot
go through the critical stage of rebellion in adolescence, in which we
reject their ideas and discover our own identity. We grow up lost,
constantly searching outside ourselves for that identity. Without
teachers and masters whom we acknowledge as superior and worthy of
respect, we cannot learn from their experience and wisdom, perhaps
even seeking later on to surpass them with new and better ideas.
Without leaders who dedicate much mental energy to foreseeing
trends and guiding us to long-term solutions, we are lost. And as this
situation becomes the norm, because we humans have always needed
some form of authority as a guide, we tend to fall for certain fake forms
of authority that proliferate in times of chaos and uncertainty.
This could be the strongman, who gives the illusion of leadership
and direction but has no real vision of where to go, just ideas and
actions that serve his ego and enhance his sense of control. This could
be the panderer, the leader who cleverly mimics what the public wants
to hear, creating the illusion of being sensitive to the group and giving
it what it wants. This could be the chummy leader, who affects the style
and mannerisms of everyone else, offering what seems to be the
ultimate in fairness, fun, and consensus. This could also be the
authority of the group, which becomes that much more powerful in the
age of social media: what other people are saying and doing must be
true and respected, by dint of sheer numbers. But all of these false
forms only lead to more turmoil, chaos, and bad decisions.
As students of human nature, we must recognize the myriad
dangers of our prejudice against authority figures. To acknowledge
people of authority in the world is not an admission of our own
inferiority but rather an acceptance of human nature and the need for
such figures. People of authority should not be seen as self-serving or
tyrannical—in fact, those are the qualities that diminish their
authority. They are not relics of the past but people who fulfill a
necessary function and whose style adapts with the times. Authority
can be an eminently democratic phenomenon. We must realize that
much of what is behind progressive ideas of consensus, the minimal
leader, and the parent as friend, is actually a great fear of

[PAGE 508]
responsibility, of the tough choices that must be made, of standing out
and taking the heat. We must move in the opposite direction,
embracing the risks and dangers that come with leadership and
authority.
In the world today, we humans have become more self-absorbed,
more tribal and tenacious in holding on to our narrow agendas; we
have become consumed by the barrage of information inundating us;
we are even more fickle when it comes to leaders. And so the need for
true figures of authority—with an elevated perspective, a high
attunement to the group, and a feel for what unifies it—has never been
greater. And because of that, we are tasked with establishing our
authority and assuming such a necessary role.
Strategies for Establishing Authority
Remember that the essence of authority is that people willingly follow
your lead. They choose to adhere to your words and advice. They want
your wisdom. Certainly at times you may have to use force, rewards
and punishments, and inspiring speeches. It is only a matter of degree.
The less your need of such devices, the greater your authority. And so
you must think of continually striving to engage people’s willpower and
overcome their natural resistances and ambivalence. That is what the
following strategies are designed to do. Put them all into practice.
Find your authority style: Authenticity. The authority you establish must
emerge naturally from your character, from the particular strengths
you possess. Think of certain archetypes of authority: one of them suits
you best. A notable archetype is the Deliverer, such as Moses or Martin
Luther King Jr., an individual determined to deliver people from evil.
Deliverers have an acute dislike of any kind of injustice, particularly
those that affect the group they identify with. They have so much
conviction, and most often such a way with words, that people are
drawn to them.
Another archetype would be the Founder. These are the ones who
establish a new order in politics or business. They generally have a
keen sense of trends and a great aversion to the status quo. They are
unconventional and independent minded. Their greatest joy is to
tinker and invent something new. Many people naturally rally to the
side of Founders, because they represent some form of progress.

[PAGE 509]
Related to this archetype would be the Visionary Artist, such as Pablo
Picasso or the jazz artist John Coltrane or the film director David
Lynch. These artists learn the conventions in their field and then turn
them upside down. They crave some new style and they create it. With
their skill, they always find an audience and followers.
Other archetypes could include the Truth Seeker (people who have
no tolerance for lies and politicking); the Quiet Pragmatist (they want
nothing more than to fix things that are broken, and have infinite
patience); the Healer (they have a knack for finding what will fulfill
and unify people); the Teacher (they have a way of getting people to
initiate action and learn from their mistakes). You must identify with
one of these archetypes, or any others that are noticeable in culture.
By bringing out a style that is natural to you, you give the
impression that it is something beyond you, as if your sense of justice
or nose for trends came from your DNA or were a gift from the gods.
You cannot help but fight for your cause or create a new order. Without
this naturalness, it might seem that your attempt at authority is too
opportunistic and manipulative, that your support for some cause or
trend is a mere ploy for power. The earlier you recognize this style the
better; you will have more time to hone it, to adapt it to changes in
yourself and in the culture, to bring out new facets to impress and
fascinate people. And having left signs of this style from the beginning
of your career, it will seem all the more like a higher power that you
cannot help but follow.
Focus outwardly: the Attitude. We humans are self-absorbed by nature
and spend most of our time focusing inwardly on our emotions, on our
wounds, on our fantasies. You want to develop the habit of reversing
this as much as possible. You do this in three ways. First, you hone
your listening skills, absorbing yourself in the words and nonverbal
cues of others. You train yourself to read between the lines of what
people are saying. You attune yourself to their moods and their needs,
and sense what they are missing. You do not take people’s smiles and
approving looks for reality but rather sense the underlying tension or
fascination.
Second, you dedicate yourself to earning people’s respect. You do
not feel entitled to it; your focus is not on your feelings and what
people owe you because of your position and greatness (an inward
turn). You earn their respect by respecting their individual needs and

[PAGE 510]
by proving that you are working for the greater good. Third, you
consider being a leader a tremendous responsibility, the welfare of the
group hanging on your every decision. What drives you is not getting
attention but bringing about the best results possible for the most
people. You absorb yourself in the work, not your ego. You feel a deep
and visceral connection to the group, seeing your fate and theirs as
deeply intertwined.
If you exude this attitude, people will feel it, and it will open them
up to your influence. They will be drawn to you by the simple fact that
it is rare to encounter a person so sensitive to people’s moods and
focused so supremely on results. This will make you stand out from the
crowd, and in the end you will gain far more attention this way than by
signaling your desperate need to be popular and liked.
Cultivate the third eye: the Vision. In 401 BC, ten thousand Greek
mercenary soldiers, fighting on behalf of the Persian prince Darius in
his attempt to take over the empire from the king, his brother,
suddenly found themselves on the losing side of the battle, and now
trapped deep in the heart of Persia. When the victorious Persians
tricked the leaders of the mercenaries into coming to a meeting to
discuss their fate and then executed them all, it became clear to the
surviving soldiers that they would be either executed as well or sold
into slavery by the next day. That night they wandered through their
camp bemoaning their fate.
Among them was the writer Xenophon, who had gone along with
the soldiers as a kind of roving reporter. Xenophon had studied
philosophy as a student of Socrates. He believed in the supremacy of
rational thinking, of seeing the entire picture, the general idea behind
the fleeting appearances of daily life. He had practiced such thinking
skills over several years.
That night he had a vision of how the Greeks could escape their trap
and return home. He saw them moving swiftly and stealthily through
Persia, sacrificing everything for speed. He saw them leaving right
away, using the element of surprise to gain some distance. He thought
ahead—of the terrain, the route to take, the many enemies they would
face, how they could help and use citizens who revolted against the
Persians. He saw them getting rid of their wagons, living off the land
and moving quickly, even in winter. In the space of a few hours, he had

[PAGE 511]
conjured up the details of the retreat, all inspired by his overall vision
of their fast zigzag route to the Mediterranean and home.
Although he had no military experience, his vision was so complete,
and he communicated it with such confidence, that the soldiers
nominated him as their de facto leader. It took several years and
involved many ensuing challenges, each time Xenophon applying his
global vision to determine a strategy, but in the end, he proved the
power of such rational thinking by leading them to safety despite the
immense odds against them.
This story embodies the essence of all authority and the most
essential element in establishing it. Most people are locked in the
moment. They are prone to overreacting and panicking, to seeing only
a narrow part of the reality facing the group. They cannot entertain
alternative ideas or prioritize. Those who maintain their presence of
mind and elevate their perspective above the moment tap into the
visionary powers of the human mind and cultivate that third eye for
unseen forces and trends. They stand out from the group, fulfill the
true function of leadership, and create the aura of authority by seeming
to possess the godlike ability to read the future. And this is a power
that can be practiced and developed and applied to any situation.
As early in life as possible, you train yourself to disconnect from the
emotions roiling the group. You force yourself to raise your vision, to
imagine the larger picture. You strain to see events in themselves,
uncolored by people’s partisan opinions. You entertain the perspective
of the enemy; you listen to the ideas of outsiders; you open your mind
to various possibilities. In this way, you gain a feel for the gestalt, or
overall shape of the situation. You game out the possible trends, how
things might play out in the future, and in particular how things could
go wrong. You have infinite patience for this exercise. The more deeply
you go into it, the more you can acquire the power to discern the future
in some form.
Those who faced Napoleon Bonaparte on the battlefield often had
the impression he read their minds and knew of their plans, but he had
merely thought forward more thoroughly than the other side. The
great German thinker and writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe seemed
to have the uncanny ability to predict future trends, but it came from
years of study and global thinking.

[PAGE 512]
Once you have your vision, you then slowly work backward to the
present, creating a reasonable and flexible way to reach your goal. The
more thinking that goes into this process, the more confident you will
feel about your plan, and this confidence will infect and convince
others. If people doubt your vision, you stay inwardly firm. Time will
prove you right. If you fall short of your goals, take this as a sign you
have not gone far enough with your thinking.
Lead from the front: the Tone. As the leader, you must be seen working
as hard as or even harder than everyone else. You set the highest
standards for yourself. You are consistent and accountable. If there are
sacrifices that need to be made, you are the first to make them for the
good of the group. This sets the proper tone. The members will feel
compelled to raise themselves up to your level and gain your approval,
much like Elizabeth’s ministers. They will internalize your values and
subtly imitate you. You will not have to yell and lecture them to make
them work harder. They will want to.
It is important that you set this tone from the beginning. First
impressions are critical. If you try later on to show you want to lead
from the front, it will look forced and lack credibility. Equally
important is to show some initial toughness; if people get the
impression early on that they can maneuver you, they will do so
mercilessly. You set limits that are fair. If members don’t rise to the
high levels you uphold, you punish them. Your tone in speaking or
writing is peremptory and bold. People always respect strength in the
leader, as long as it does not stir up fears of the abuse of power. If such
toughness is not natural to you, develop it, or you will not last very
long in the position. You will always have plenty of time to reveal that
softer, kinder side that is really you, but if you start soft, you signal that
you are a pushover.
Begin this early on in your career by developing the highest possible
standards for your own work (see the next section for more on this)
and by training yourself to be constantly aware of how your manner
and tone affect people in the subtlest of ways.
Stir conflicting emotions: the Aura. Most people are too predictable. To
mix well in social situations, they assume a persona that is consistent—
jovial, pleasing, bold, sensitive. They try to hide other qualities that
they are afraid to show. As the leader, you want to be more mysterious,
to establish a presence that fascinates people. By sending mixed

[PAGE 513]
signals, by showing qualities that are ever so slightly contrary, you
cause people to pause in their instant categorizations and to think
about who you really are. The more they think about you, the larger
and more authoritative your presence.
So, for instance, you are generally kind and sensitive, but you show
an undertone of harshness, of intolerance toward certain types of
behavior. This is the pose of parents, who demonstrate their love while
indicating limits and boundaries. The child is trapped between
affection and a touch of fear, and from that tension comes respect. In
general, try to keep your bursts of anger or recriminations as
infrequent as possible. Because you are mostly quiet and empathetic,
when your anger flares, it really stands out and has the power to make
people truly intimidated and contrite.
You can mix prudence with an undertone of boldness that you
occasionally display. You deliberate long on problems, but once a
decision is made, you act with great energy and audacity. Such
boldness comes out of nowhere and creates a strong impression. Or
you can blend the spiritual with an undertone of earthy pragmatism.
Those were the paradoxical qualities of Martin Luther King Jr. that
fascinated people. Or you can be folksy and regal, like Queen Elizabeth
I. Or you can blend the masculine and the feminine. (See
