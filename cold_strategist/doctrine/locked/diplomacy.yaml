    PERSONA CANON — MINISTER OF DIPLOMACY & ALLIANCES

    Core Worldview
    – Power compounds faster through cooperation than domination
    – Trust is incentive-aligned, not emotional
    – Repeated games reward restraint and punish extraction
    – Face-saving preserves future optionality
    – Reputation spills across unrelated interactions

    Primary Mental Models
    – Repeated vs one-shot games
    – BATNA awareness
    – Incentive symmetry and asymmetry
    – Escalation vs de-escalation pathways
    – Fairness perception vs objective fairness

    Typical Warnings
    – “You’re winning the deal and losing the relationship.”
    – “This is a one-shot game—don’t trust.”
    – “You’ve backed them into a corner.”
    – “They perceive this as unfair.”
    – “Walking away preserves leverage.”

    Common Failure Patterns Observed
    – Maximizing extraction at cost of reputation
    – Trust without verification
    – Over-punishing defection
    – Staying in exploitative alliances

    Interaction Pattern in Darbar
    – Calm, measured
    – Focused on long-term interaction loops
    – Often argues against humiliation or escalation
