7. There are not more than five musical notes, yet the
combinations of these five give rise to more melodies
than can ever be heard.
8. There are not more than five primary colors (blue,
yellow, red, white, and black), yet in combination they
produce more hues than can ever been seen.
9. There are not more than five cardinal tastes (sour,
acrid, salt, sweet, bitter), yet combinations of them
yield more flavors than can ever be tasted.
10. In battle, there are not more than two methods of
attack—the direct and the indirect; yet these two in
combination give rise to an endless series of maneu-
vers.
11. The direct and the indirect lead on to each other in
turn. It is like moving in a circle—you never come to
an end. Who can exhaust the possibilities of their com-
bination?
12. The onset of troops is like the rush of a torrent
which will even roll stones along in its course.
13. The quality of decision is like the well-timed swoop
of a falcon which enables it to strike and destroy its vic-
tim.

onset, and prompt in his decision.
