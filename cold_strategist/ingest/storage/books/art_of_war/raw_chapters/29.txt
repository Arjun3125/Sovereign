30. Disciplined and calm, to await the appearance of
disorder and hubbub amongst the enemy:—this is the
art of retaining self-possession.
31. To be near the goal while the enemy is still far from
it, to wait at ease while the enemy is toiling and strug-
gling, to be well-fed while the enemy is famished:—
this is the art of husbanding one’s strength.
32. To refrain from intercepting an enemy whose ban-
ners are in perfect order, to refrain from attacking an
army drawn up in calm and confident array:—this is
the art of studying circumstances.
33. It is a military axiom not to advance uphill against
the enemy, nor to oppose him when he comes downhill.
34. Do not pursue an enemy who simulates flight; do
not attack soldiers whose temper is keen.
35. Do not swallow bait offered by the enemy. Do not
interfere with an army that is returning home.
36. When you surround an army, leave an outlet free.
Do not press a desperate foe too hard.
37. Such is the art of warfare.
