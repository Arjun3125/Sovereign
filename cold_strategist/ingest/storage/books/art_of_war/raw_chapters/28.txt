ordinary objects be seen clearly enough: hence the
institution of banners and flags.
24. Gongs and drums, banners and flags, are means
whereby the ears and eyes of the host may be focused
on one particular point.
25. The host thus forming a single united body, is it
impossible either for the brave to advance alone, or for
the cowardly to retreat alone. This is the art of handling
large masses of men.
26. In night-fighting, then, make much use of signal-
fires and drums, and in fighting by day, of flags and
banners, as a means of influencing the ears and eyes of
your army.
27. A whole army may be robbed of its spirit; a com-
mander-in-chief may be robbed of his presence of
mind.
28. Now a soldier’s spirit is keenest in the morning; by
noonday it has begun to flag; and in the evening, his
mind is bent only on returning to camp.
29. A clever general, therefore, avoids an army when
its spirit is keen, but attacks it when it is sluggish and
inclined to return. This is the art of studying moods.
