26. How victory may be produced for them out of the
enemy’s own tactics—that is what the multitude cannot
comprehend.
27. All men can see the tactics whereby I conquer, but
what none can see is the strategy out of which victory
is evolved.
28. Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you
one victory, but let your methods be regulated by the
infinite variety of circumstances.
29. Military tactics are like unto water; for water in its
natural course runs away from high places and hastens
downwards.
30. So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong and to
strike at what is weak.
31. Water shapes its course according to the nature of
the ground over which it flows; the soldier works out
his victory in relation to the foe whom he is facing.
32. Therefore, just as water retains no constant shape,
so in warfare there are no constant conditions.
33. He who can modify his tactics in relation to his
opponent and thereby succeed in winning, may be
called a heaven-born captain.
