1. Sun Tzu said: We come now to the question of
encamping the army, and observing signs of the enemy.
Pass quickly over mountains, and keep in the neigh-
borhood of valleys.
2. Camp in high places, facing the sun. Do not climb
heights in order to fight. So much for mountain war-
fare.
3. After crossing a river, you should get far away from
it.
4. When an invading force crosses a river in its onward
march, do not advance to meet it in mid-stream. It will
be best to let half the army get across, and then deliver
your attack.
5. If you are anxious to fight, you should not go to meet
the invader near a river which he has to cross.
6. Moor your craft higher up than the enemy, and fac-
ing the sun. Do not move up-stream to meet the enemy.
So much for river warfare.
7. In crossing salt-marshes, your sole concern should
be to get over them quickly, without any delay.
