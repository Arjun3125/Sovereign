  "claims": [
    "In the practical art of war, the best thing of all is to take the enemy\u2019s country whole and intact; to shatter and destroy it is not so good.",
    "It is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it, to capture a regiment, a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them."
  ],
  "rules": [
    "To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy\u2019s resistance without fighting.",
    "The highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy\u2019s plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy\u2019s forces; the next in order is to attack the enemy\u2019s army in the field; and the worst policy of all is to besiege walled cities."
  ],
  "warnings": [
    "The rule is, not to besiege walled cities if it can possibly be avoided. The preparation of mantlets, movable shelters, and various implements of war, will take up three whole months; and the piling up of mounds over against the walls will take three months more."
