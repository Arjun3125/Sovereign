8. To see victory only when it is within the ken of the
common herd is not the acme of excellence.
9. Neither is it the acme of excellence if you fight and
conquer and the whole Empire says, “Well done!”
10. To lift an autumn hair is no sign of great strength;
to see the sun and moon is no sign of sharp sight; to
hear the noise of thunder is no sign of a quick ear.
11. What the ancients called a clever fighter is one who
not only wins, but excels in winning with ease.
12. Hence his victories bring him neither reputation for
wisdom nor credit for courage.
13. He wins his battles by making no mistakes. Making
no mistakes is what establishes the certainty of victory,
for it means conquering an enemy that is already
defeated.
14. Hence the skillful fighter puts himself into a posi-
tion which makes defeat impossible, and does not miss
the moment for defeating the enemy.
15. Thus it is that in war the victorious strategist only
seeks battle after the victory has been won, whereas he
who is destined to defeat first fights and afterwards
looks for victory.
