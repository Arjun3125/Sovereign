1. Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his com-
mands from the sovereign.
2. Having collected an army and concentrated his
forces, he must blend and harmonize the different ele-
ments thereof before pitching his camp.
3. After that, comes tactical maneuvering, than which
there is nothing more difficult. The difficulty of tactical
maneuvering consists in turning the devious into the
direct, and misfortune into gain.
4. Thus, to take a long and circuitous route, after entic-
ing the enemy out of the way, and though starting after
him, to contrive to reach the goal before him, shows
knowledge of the artifice of DEVIATION.
5. Maneuvering with an army is advantageous; with an
undisciplined multitude, most dangerous.
6. If you set a fully equipped army in march in order to
snatch an advantage, the chances are that you will be
too late. On the other hand, to detach a flying column
for the purpose involves the sacrifice of its baggage
and stores.
