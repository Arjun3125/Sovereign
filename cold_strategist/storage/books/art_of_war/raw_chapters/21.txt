14. We can form a single united body, while the enemy
must split up into fractions. Hence there will be a
whole pitted against separate parts of a whole, which
means that we shall be many to the enemy’s few.
15. And if we are able thus to attack an inferior force
with a superior one, our opponents will be in dire
straits.
16. The spot where we intend to fight must not be made
known; for then the enemy will have to prepare against
a possible attack at several different points; and his
forces being thus distributed in many directions, the
numbers we shall have to face at any given point will
be proportionately few.
17. For should the enemy strengthen his van, he will
weaken his rear; should he strengthen his rear, he will
weaken his van; should he strengthen his left, he will
weaken his right; should he strengthen his right, he will
weaken his left. If he sends reinforcements every-
where, he will everywhere be weak.
18. Numerical weakness comes from having to prepare
against possible attacks; numerical strength, from com-
pelling our adversary to make these preparations
against us.
19. Knowing the place and the time of the coming bat-
tle, we may concentrate from the greatest distances in
order to fight.
