7. Thus, if you order your men to roll up their buff-
coats, and make forced marches without halting day or
night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch,
doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the
leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the
hands of the enemy.
8. The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will
fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your
army will reach its destination.
9. If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the
enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division,
and only half your force will reach the goal.
10. If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-
thirds of your army will arrive.
11. We may take it then that an army without its bag-
gage-train is lost; without provisions it is lost; without
bases of supply it is lost.
12. We cannot enter into alliances until we are
acquainted with the designs of our neighbors.
13. We are not fit to lead an army on the march unless
we are familiar with the face of the country—its moun-
tains and forests, its pitfalls and precipices, its marshes
and swamps.
