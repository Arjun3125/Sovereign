    "If you order your men to roll up their buff-coats and make forced marches without halting day or night, covering double the usual distance at a stretch, doing a hundred LI in order to wrest an advantage, the leaders of all your three divisions will fall into the hands of the enemy.",
    "The stronger men will be in front, the jaded ones will fall behind, and on this plan only one-tenth of your army will reach its destination.",
    "If you march fifty LI in order to outmaneuver the enemy, you will lose the leader of your first division, and only half your force will reach the goal.",
    "If you march thirty LI with the same object, two-thirds of your army will arrive."
