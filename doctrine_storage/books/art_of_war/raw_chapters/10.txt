12. There are three ways in which a ruler can bring
misfortune upon his army:—
13. (1) By commanding the army to advance or to
retreat, being ignorant of the fact that it cannot obey.
This is called hobbling the army.
14. (2) By attempting to govern an army in the same
way as he administers a kingdom, being ignorant of the
conditions which obtain in an army. This causes rest-
lessness in the soldier’s minds.
15. (3) By employing the officers of his army without
discrimination, through ignorance of the military prin-
ciple of adaptation to circumstances. This shakes the
confidence of the soldiers.
16. But when the army is restless and distrustful, trou-
ble is sure to come from the other feudal princes. This
is simply bringing anarchy into the army, and flinging
victory away.
17. Thus we may know that there are five essentials
for victory:
(1) He will win who knows when to fight and when
not to fight.
(2) He will win who knows how to handle both
superior and inferior forces.
(3) He will win whose army is animated by the
same spirit throughout all its ranks.
