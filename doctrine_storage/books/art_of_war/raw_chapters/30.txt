1. Sun Tzu said: In war, the general receives his com-
mands from the sovereign, collects his army and con-
centrates his forces.
2. When in difficult country, do not encamp. In country
where high roads intersect, join hands with your allies.
Do not linger in dangerously isolated positions. In
hemmed-in situations, you must resort to stratagem. In
desperate position, you must fight.
3. There are roads which must not be followed, armies
which must be not attacked, towns which must be
besieged, positions which must not be contested, com-
mands of the sovereign which must not be obeyed.
4. The general who thoroughly understands the advan-
tages that accompany variation of tactics knows how to
handle his troops.
5. The general who does not understand these, may be
well acquainted with the configuration of the country,
yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practi-
cal account.
