1. Sun Tzu said: The control of a large force is the same
principle as the control of a few men: it is merely a
question of dividing up their numbers.
2. Fighting with a large army under your command is
nowise different from fighting with a small one: it is
merely a question of instituting signs and signals.
3. To ensure that your whole host may withstand the
brunt of the enemy’s attack and remain unshaken—this
is effected by maneuvers direct and indirect.
4. That the impact of your army may be like a grind-
stone dashed against an egg—this is effected by the sci-
ence of weak points and strong.
5. In all fighting, the direct method may be used for
joining battle, but indirect methods will be needed in
order to secure victory.
6. Indirect tactics, efficiently applied, are inexhaustible
as Heaven and Earth, unending as the flow of rivers
and streams; like the sun and moon, they end but to
begin anew; like the four seasons, they pass away to
return once more.
