15. Energy may be likened to the bending of a cross-
bow; decision, to the releasing of a trigger.
16. Amid the turmoil and tumult of battle, there may be
seeming disorder and yet no real disorder at all; amid
confusion and chaos, your array may be without head
or tail, yet it will be proof against defeat.
17. Simulated disorder postulates perfect discipline,
simulated fear postulates courage; simulated weakness
postulates strength.
18. Hiding order beneath the cloak of disorder is sim-
ply a question of subdivision; concealing courage
under a show of timidity presupposes a fund of latent
energy; masking strength with weakness is to be effect-
ed by tactical dispositions.
19. Thus one who is skillful at keeping the enemy on
the move maintains deceitful appearances, according to
which the enemy will act. He sacrifices something,
that the enemy may snatch at it.
20. By holding out baits, he keeps him on the march;
then with a body of picked men he lies in wait for him.
21. The clever combatant looks to the effect of com-
bined energy, and does not require too much from indi-
viduals. Hence his ability to pick out the right men and
utilize combined energy.
