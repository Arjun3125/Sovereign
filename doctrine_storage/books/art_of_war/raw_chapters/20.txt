ensure the safety of your defense if you only hold posi-
tions that cannot be attacked.
8. Hence that general is skillful in attack whose oppo-

defense whose opponent does not know what to attack.
9. O divine art of subtlety and secrecy! Through you
we learn to be invisible, through you inaudible; and
hence we can hold the enemy’s fate in our hands.
10. You may advance and be absolutely irresistible, if
you make for the enemy’s weak points; you may retire
and be safe from pursuit if your movements are more

11. If we wish to fight, the enemy can be forced to an
engagement even though he be sheltered behind a high
rampart and a deep ditch. All we need do is attack some
other place that he will be obliged to relieve.
12. If we do not wish to fight, we can prevent the
enemy from engaging us even though the lines of our
encampment be merely traced out on the ground. All
we need do is to throw something odd and unaccount-
able in his way.
13. By discovering the enemy’s dispositions and
remaining invisible ourselves, we can keep our forces
concentrated, while the enemy’s must be divided.
