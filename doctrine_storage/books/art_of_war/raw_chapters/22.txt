20. But if neither time nor place be known, then the left
wing will be impotent to succor the right, the right
equally impotent to succor the left, the van unable to
relieve the rear, or the rear to support the van. How
much more so if the furthest portions of the army are
anything under a hundred LI apart, and even the near-
est are separated by several LI!

Yueh exceed our own in number, that shall advantage

22. Though the enemy be stronger in numbers, we may
prevent him from fighting. Scheme so as to discover
his plans and the likelihood of their success.
23. Rouse him, and learn the principle of his activity or
inactivity. Force him to reveal himself, so as to find out
his vulnerable spots.
24. Carefully compare the opposing army with your
own, so that you may know where strength is super-
abundant and where it is deficient.
25. In making tactical dispositions, the highest pitch
you can attain is to conceal them; conceal your dispo-
sitions, and you will be safe from the prying of the sub-
tlest spies, from the machinations of the wisest brains.
