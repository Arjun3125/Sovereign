he is in superior strength, evade him.
22. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irri-
tate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arro-

26. Now the general who wins a battle makes
many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought.
The general who loses a battle makes but few calcula-

I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.
