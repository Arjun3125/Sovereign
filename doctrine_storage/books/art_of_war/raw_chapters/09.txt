8. It is the rule in war, if our forces are ten to the
enemy’s one, to surround him; if five to one, to attack

9. If equally matched, we can offer battle; if slightly
inferior in numbers, we can avoid the enemy; if quite
unequal in every way, we can flee from him.
10. Hence, though an obstinate fight may be made by a
small force, in the end it must be captured by the larg-
er force.
