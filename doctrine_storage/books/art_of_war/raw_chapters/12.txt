1. Sun Tzu said:The good fighters of old first put them-
selves beyond the possibility of defeat, and then wait-
ed for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.
2. To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own
hands, but the opportunity of defeating the enemy is
provided by the enemy himself.
3. Thus the good fighter is able to secure himself
against defeat, but cannot make certain of defeating the
enemy.
4. Hence the saying: One may know how to conquer
without being able to do it.
5. Security against defeat implies defensive tactics;
ability to defeat the enemy means taking the offensive.
6. Standing on the defensive indicates insufficient
strength; attacking, a superabundance of strength.
7. The general who is skilled in defense hides in the
most secret recesses of the earth; he who is skilled in
attack flashes forth from the topmost heights of heav-
en. Thus on the one hand we have ability to protect our-
selves; on the other, a victory that is complete.
